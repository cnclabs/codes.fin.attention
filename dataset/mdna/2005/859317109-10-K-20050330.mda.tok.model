item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides management s analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of sterling financial corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries  bank of lancaster county  na  first national bank of north east  bank of hanover and trust company  pennsylvania state bank  hovb investment co  t c leasing  inc t c  pennbanks insurance company  spc  church capital management llc  bainbridge securities  inc  stoudtadvisors  lancaster insurance group  llc and sterling mortgage services  inc inactive 
the consolidated financial statements also include town country leasing  llc  sterling financial trust company and equipment finance llc  all wholly owned subsidiaries of bank of lancaster county 
management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes appearing elsewhere in this report and is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the major changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the company with a primary focus on sterling s performance 
critical accounting policies sterling s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles require management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by sterling are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the evaluation of goodwill impairment to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses 
with the adoption of sfas no 
on january   sterling is no longer required to amortize goodwill resulting from business acquisitions 
goodwill is now subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
sterling tests for impairment based on the goodwill maintained at each defined reporting unit 
an independent party using various market valuation methodologies determines the fair value 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write downs of recorded goodwill are necessary 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  an impairment expense may be required to be recorded to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
sterling completed its annual impairment testing and determined that no impairment write offs were necessary 
no assurance can be given that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
any material effect on the financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is also discussed in this management discussion and analysis 
non gaap presentations this management s discussion and analysis refers to the efficiency ratio that is a non gaap financial measure that we believe provides readers with important information regarding sterling s operational efficiency 
comparison of sterling s efficiency ratio with other companies may not be appropriate  as they may calculate their efficiency ratio in a different manner 
the efficiency ratio is computed by dividing non interest expense  less depreciation on operating leases  by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and non interest income  less depreciation on operating leases 
sterling nets the depreciation on operating leases against related income  as it is consistent with utilizing net interest income presentation for comparable capital leases  which nets interest expense against interest income 
the efficiency ratio excludes unusual items  such as gains losses on securities activities  interest collected on charged off loans  etc 
sterling  in referring to its net income  is referring to income determined in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
inflation and interest rates the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and  therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets and on non interest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
inflationary pressures over the last few years have been modest  although the potential for future inflationary pressure is always present given changing trends in the economy 
during the past several years  the federal reserve has been very active in monitoring economic data  and has used interest rates to help stimulate economic growth and control inflation 
starting in short term interest rates decreased  with sharp reductions in and more modest reductions in and however  in  the federal reserve began a measured effort to control inflationary pressures and raised the federal funds rate five times in basis point increments 
management recognizes that asset liability management  including the effect of rate changes on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  is of critical importance 
results of operations all dollar amounts presented within tables are in thousands  except per share data 
executive overview sterling s executive management team and board of directors have identified three performance measurements that they feel are key elements for enhancing shareholder value 
these include increase in earnings per share  return on realized equity  and efficiency ratio 
the primary source of sterling s revenues  are net interest income derived from investments  which would include loans and investments  less their deposit and borrowing funding costs  as well as fees from financial services provided to customers  including rental income on operating leases 
revenues are influenced by general economic factors  including market interest rates  the economy of the markets served  stock market conditions  as well as competitive forces within the markets 
despite a low interest rate environment and overall decline in the financial services industry s net interest margin  sterling was able to improve its net interest margin  from and in and  to in the improvement was primarily the result of a shift in the composition of sterling s interest earning assets  away from lower yielding federal funds and securities to higher yielding loans  particularly commercial loans and finance receivables 
net interest income increased to  in  compared to  in and  in the acquisition of church capital  bainbridge securities and stoudtadvisors favorably impacted non interest income 
total non interest income  excluding securities gains was   and  in  and the revenue generated from the new services provided more than offset the declines in mortgage banking income and rental income on operating leases 
in addition  securities gains losses were   and  in  and this increase is the direct result of the investment strategies of exiting insurance industry positions due to their demutualization  and gains that were taken upon the liquidation of certain bank stocks given favorable market conditions 
the proceeds of the sale of these securities were used to capitalize delaware sterling bank trust company  a delaware chartered bank that commenced operations on january  as a result of the growth sterling has experienced in its revenues over the past three years  non interest expense has also increased to  in  compared to  in and  in the increase in revenues that sterling has experienced can be attributed to our relationship management model  which has resulted in new customer relationships  new financial services products being offered to meet their needs and expansion of our market into new geographic regions 
these efforts have resulted in increases in salaries and employee benefits  higher occupancy and equipment charges and other non interest expenses 
also  intangible asset amortization has increased as a direct result of the identifiable intangible assets that resulted from the acquisitions of church capital management  stoudtadvisors and pennsylvania state bank 
sterling s overall strategy is to enhance growth in existing markets and affiliates  and complement this with new products and services  through the leveraging of existing resources 
this has resulted in net income of  or per diluted share in  compared to  or per diluted share in  and  or per diluted share in this represents an increase in diluted earnings per diluted share in  over results  and a increase in over results 
returns on average realized equity decreased slightly  to in  compared to and in and sterling s efficiency ratio  which expresses non interest expenses as a percentage of tax equivalent net interest income and non interest income  has slipped to in  compared to in and in this is the direct result of intangible asset amortization  expansion into new market territories and its impact on expenses and the acquisition of non bank affiliates that generally carry higher expense to revenue ratios than bank affiliates 
a more thorough discussion of sterling s results of operations is included in the following pages 
net interest income the primary component of sterling s revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income and fees on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing funds 
earning assets include loans  securities and federal funds sold 
interest bearing funds include deposits  borrowed funds and subordinated debt 
to compare the tax exempt yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on a federal corporate income tax rate 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates  volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities and the composition 
the interest rate spread and net interest margin are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income 
the interest rate spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is defined as the percentage of taxable equivalent net interest income to average earning assets 
due mainly to demand deposits and stockholders equity  the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread  as these funding sources are non interest bearing 
table presents net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis  interest rate spread and net interest margin for the years ending december    and table analyzes the changes in net interest income for the periods broken down by their rate and volume components 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  totaled  in compared to  for and  in excluding the interest recovery on a charged off loan 
the increase in net interest income of  from to reflects both an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets as well as a shift in the mix of interest earning assets that led to an bp increase in net interest margin 
the increase in interest earning assets came primarily in the form of loans 
in fact  the growth in loans exceeded the growth in earning assets  reflecting the funding of a portion of the loan growth with securities portfolio cash flow and overnight federal funds over the past year 
strong growth in the commercial loan and finance receivable portfolios as well as consumer loans and leases contributed to the increase in total loans 
year over year  average loans increased  increasing the percentage of loans to interest earning assets from in to in generally  loans carry a higher yield than alternative interest earning assets  primarily securities and other investments 
the remainder of the growth in loans was funded by growth in deposits  borrowings and shareholders equity 
strong growth was experienced in demand and savings deposits while the average balance of time deposits decreased 
over the past year  sterling experienced a significant volume of maturing certificates of deposits at high interest rates 
during that time  current certificates of deposit rates were consciously held at the now lower market levels 
the increase in short term borrowings reflects a shift in sterling s overnight federal funds position from selling federal funds to purchasing federal funds  in part due to the development of sterling s correspondent services group 
this group has established a number of federal funds lines for community bank clients 
the increase in borrowed funds reflects borrowings of  in to provide funding for net loan growth and to replace scheduled maturities and repayments of debt 
these borrowings also included  of borrowings acquired with pennsylvania state bank 
in addition  during  sterling leveraged the proceeds of trust preferred securities by borrowing  from the federal home loan bank and purchase securities with these funds 
because these funds were borrowed part way through the year  they partially increased the prior year s average 
net interest margin increased to from resulting from a number of factors as noted previously  growth rate in loans has exceeded the growth rate in earning assets  reflecting the funding of a portion of the loan growth with securities portfolio cash flow and overnight federal funds over the past year 
generally  loans carry a higher yield than alternative interest earning assets  namely securities and other investments 
thus  this improved mix of earning assets has helped to minimize the decrease in the overall yield on earning assets to bp from to during the two years from january to december  the federal reserve bank lowered the federal funds rate twelve times totaling 
while the fed began to raise the federal funds target rate in  the year over year impact of the dramatic decreases in short term interest rates during this time has continued to result in a decrease in the cost of funds for sterling 
the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities declined bp from to during the second quarter of  sterling expanded the use of off balance sheet instruments to manage its interest rate risk position by adding  of receive fixed  pay floating swaps 
the new swaps  when combined with the existing  pay fixed  receiving floating interest rate swap  negatively impacted the margin by approximately bp in  a slight improvement over the bp negative impact in the increase in net interest income of  from to reflects both an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets as well as a bp increase in net interest margin 
several factors had an impact on s results improved earning asset mix with strong growth in commercial loans and finance receivables funded in large part by securities portfolio cash flow and overnight federal funds  growth in lower cost demand and savings deposits  downward re pricing of certificates of deposit portfolio  leveraging of trust preferred proceeds with borrowings of  and less reliance on third party borrowings to fund growth in both finance receivables and operating leases 
sterling s ability to continue to improve its net interest margin through enhancing its earning asset mix in a similar manner as that experienced in the past few years will diminish due to the need to maintain the securities portfolio to meet pledging requirements and liquidity needs of its banking affiliates 
in addition  while the acquisition of pennsylvania state bank will increase the level of earning assets and net interest income  it is expected to have a slightly negative impact on margin 
finally  during  although short term interest rates increased by more than bp  long term rates remained relatively unchanged during this period 
the resulting flattening of the yield curve is anticipated to have a negative impact on net interest margin

further  as a result of the changing composition of the loan portfolio and geographic mix  sterling reevaluated and made certain modifications to its methodology for establishing its reserve to account for these changing risks in its loan portfolio 
sterling s methodology reflects its entrance into emerging markets with little credit history to this point  as well as its ability to enter into larger credit facilities with customers 
the provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain an adequate allowance to meet the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
see further discussion in asset quality below 
non interest income consistent with sterling s recent strategy of broadening its financial services offered to its customers through the acquisition of fee based companies and the development of new products  non interest income continues to show steady increases over the past several years 
as a result  sterling has been able to increase its non interest income  excluding securities gains losses  as a percent of total net interest income and non interest income to  and for the years ended december   and this percentage also includes netting depreciation on operating income with related income 
details of non interest income for the years ended december   and are as follows table non interest income versus versus amount amount trust and investment management income service charges on deposit accounts other service charges  commissions and fees brokerage fees and commissions insurance commissions and fees mortgage banking income rental income on operating leases other operating income securities gains losses total trust and investment management income grew to  in compared to  and  in and the acquisition of church capital management  a registered investment advisor  in the fourth quarter of  positive effects of new business development and favorable market conditions as compared to  all contributed to the revenue growth 
service charges on deposit accounts were  for the year ended december   compared to  in  an increase of 
the growth in exceeded the growth in sterling has been able to increase its service charges on deposit accounts primarily as a result of the increased number of deposit accounts 
in the fourth quarter of  a new overdraft protection program was introduced to customers electing to take advantage of this product 
as a result  we anticipate service charges on deposit accounts will continue to grow  as a full year of the overdraft protection program is in place 
brokerage fees and commissions totaled  for the year ended december   up from  in and  in the acquisition of bainbridge securities  inc  a broker dealer  in the fourth quarter of was the primary reason for the increase in revenues 
in addition to the expansion of services available to sterling s customers  the acquisition of bainbridge enables sterling to now handle brokerage transactions without having to use outside  third party sources 
favorable market conditions have also resulted in increased brokerage volume  as certain consumers are shifting their investment funds back towards the equity and mutual fund markets 
insurance commissions and fees were   and  in  and the acquisition of corporate healthcare strategies in the second quarter of and the acquisition of the remaining interest of lancaster insurance group in the third quarter of were the primary factors contributing to the increase 
these acquisitions were consistent with sterling s philosophy of building a comprehensive financial services organization  and as a result  management believes it has enhanced its ability to deliver benefit solutions to its individual and business customers 
mortgage banking income was  in  down from  in and  in the decrease in mortgage banking revenue in compared to is the result of lower production and sales volume arising from a generally higher interest rate environment in and the resulting reduction in refinancing activities 
conversely  the higher revenues in compared to  was the result of year lows in interest rates  which generated an active housing market as well as increases in refinancings 
rental income on operating leases was  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
this follows a slight increase of in the lack of growth in rental income is primarily due to customers entering into more traditional financing arrangements such as commercial loans and finance leases  given the favorable tax treatment related to the depreciation of the assets leased purchased 
securities gains and losses  all from the available for sale portfolio  are summarized as follows years ended december  debt securities gains losses equity securities gains losses total gains and losses on debt securities are realized as part of ongoing investment portfolio and balance sheet management strategies 
in  sterling experienced net gains on the debt security portfolio of  versus net gains of  in and net losses of  in equity security gains and losses are generated primarily through sterling s equity portfolio of financial institution sector stocks 
net securities gains on equities were  for the year ended december  versus securities gains of  in and net losses of  in gains are taken as the result of ongoing asset liability management strategies and capitalizing on appreciated values on certain equity security portfolio positions 
in  the proceeds from the sales of certain equity securities were used to capitalize delaware sterling bank trust company  a wholly owned subsidiary of sterling that commenced operations on january  during  sterling took no other than temporary impairment charges on the financial institution portfolio versus  and  in and non interest expense total non interest expenses were  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  over  in this followed a  or  increase in over s non interest expenses of  in general terms  the increases experienced by sterling are largely attributable to the acquisitions completed during this time period 
consistent with the accounting rules surrounding purchase accounting  expenses are included in sterling s results of operations after the acquisition is completed 
as such  expenses related to church capital and bainbridge are included from october forward  expenses of corporate healthcare strategies are included from june and forward  and sterling s most recent acquisition  pennsylvania state bank  is included from december  and forward 
a more thorough discussion of non interest expense follows table non interest expense versus versus amount amount salaries and employee benefits net occupancy furniture equipment professional services depreciation on operating lease assets taxes other than income intangible asset amortization other total the largest component of non interest expense is salaries and employee benefits  which totaled  for the year ended december   an  or increase over  after increasing  or in the increase is attributable to the following factors a full year of salaries and benefits associated with church capital management and bainbridge securities in as compared to two and one half months in  with no similar expenses in  seven months of salaries and benefits associated with corporate healthcare strategies and approximately one month of salaries and benefits associated with pennsylvania state bank with no similar expense in the prior years  increased number of employees  the result of office expansion including pennsterling bank and delaware sterling bank trust company initiatives  and expansion in carroll county  maryland  additions to staff required to continue to serve our customers in light of increased transaction volumes  increased healthcare costs that has resulted from a growing employee base  as well as nationwide trends of increasing employee benefits costs  and normal merit increases to existing employees 
net occupancy expense increased to  in  up from  in and  in this increase is a direct result of the overall growth of the company  including expansion into the emerging markets of berks county  pennsylvania  carroll county  maryland  and new castle county  delaware 
in addition  renovations were made to existing locations  which resulted in additional occupancy changes 
sterling s new affiliates have office space that also contributed to an increase in occupancy charges 
furniture and equipment charges were   and  in  and the steady upward trend in furniture and equipment expense is the result of enhancements to the channels available to deliver products and services to customers 
additionally  certain equipment charges are based on the number of accounts opened and their transaction volumes 
as sterling s customer base continues to grow  these types of charges grow as well 
the increase in number of office locations  as well as renovations made to existing offices also contributed to the increase 
professional services totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  in  and  in the regulatory climate is becoming increasingly complex  most significantly  as the result of the sarbanes oxley act of due to these complexities  professional service fees have increased  resulting in higher compliance costs as well as contracted temporary resources necessary to meet the heightened demands and timelines of this piece of legislation 
in addition  professional service expenses have increased as a result of long term strategic planning efforts  including evaluating potential acquisition targets  the evaluation of new market territories for bank affiliates  and contracted labor to assist in integration of the new affiliates into sterling s systems and processes 
taxes other than income were  for the year ended december   an increase from  or  in and  in taxes other than income consist primarily of taxes based on shareholders equity 
as a result of the growing equity base of sterling s affiliates  including the bank affiliates  combined with the acquisition of companies subject to similar taxes  the taxes other than income expense has increased over the past several years 
in connection with sterling s recent acquisitions  several identifiable intangible assets were acquired  the most significant of which is customer lists and core deposit intangibles 
the increase is the direct result of the timing of the acquisitions 
included in is a full year of intangible amortization for church capital  as opposed to two and one half months in the prior year 
also included in totals are seven months of amortization for corporate healthcare strategies and one month of pennsylvania state bank s intangible assets 
management anticipates amortization expense will increase  as a full year worth of amortization will be included in future results 
see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other non interest expense totaled  in  compared to  in and  in expenses in this category consist of marketing  advertising  promotions  postage  lending related expenses  insurance and telephone expenses 
the primary increase in other non interest expenses is a function of sterling s overall growth  which results in higher expenses 
operating expense levels are often measured by the efficiency ratio  which expresses non interest expense  excluding merger related and restructuring charges  as a percentage of tax equivalent net interest income and other income 
in calculating its efficiency ratio  sterling nets depreciation on operating leases with the related rental income to more consistently present operating results with the banking industry 
sterling s efficiency ratio slipped to for the year ended december  from in and in this is the direct result of the intangible asset amortization and expansion into new market territories and its impact on expenses  combined with the acquisition of non bank affiliates that generally carry higher expense to revenue ratios than bank affiliates 
income taxes sterling recognized income taxes of   and  for the years ended december   and the increase in income tax expense is consistent with the higher levels of pre tax income 
a more meaningful comparison is the effective tax rate  a measurement of income tax expense as a percent of pre tax income  which was  and for the years ended december   and sterling s effective tax rate is less than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to tax exempt loan and security income and tax credits associated with low income housing projects  offset by certain non deductible expenses and state income taxes 
the effective tax rate of was favorably influenced by converting town country leasing  a c corporation at the time  to a single member limited liability company on july  due to the conversion  sterling reversed a  deferred state tax liability  which lowered its income tax expense 
excluding the  reversal  s effective tax rate would have been approximately 
financial condition average assets were  in  representing growth compared to s average assets of  the growth experienced in was consistent with the growth in average assets in sterling s loan growth was in and in  which outpaced total asset growth 
as part of an overall strategy to increase the return on equity of the corporation  the remaining growth in assets and more specifically loans  was funded by growth in average deposits  and supplemented with a reduction in the average level of federal funds sold and the cash flows from the investment securities portfolio 
average deposits were  for the year ended december   which represent growth over average deposits of  in order to meet the funding needs of the strong loan growth  average borrowings increased from  for the year ended december  to  in a more thorough discussion of asset and liabilities follows 
securities sterling utilizes investment securities as a primary tool for managing interest rate risk  to generate interest and dividend income and to provide liquidity to the parent company and affiliates 
as of december   securities totaled  which represents a decrease of  or from the december  balance of  in addition   was acquired in connection with the purchase of pennsylvania state bank 
during  as with the prior year  the cash flows from investment securities were generally used to fund loan growth generated by the company 
proceeds from maturities  sales and calls totaled  purchases of  were completed primarily to meet pledging requirements 
this activity most significantly decreased holdings of agency and corporate securities 
this was a result of a number of factors  including the generally low interest rate environment  a continued effort to reduce the credit risk associated with corporate securities and a need to maintain a sufficient level of securities that are qualified to serve as collateral for public fund and other deposits requiring pledged securities 
in addition to the cash flow activity noted above  the decrease in the portfolio reflects a change in the balance of unrealized gains on securities available for sale 
at december   the securities balance included net unrealized gains on available for sale securities of  versus net unrealized gains of  at december  the decrease in unrealized gains resulted from higher interest rates at year end versus year end higher interest rates generally decrease the value of debt securities 
sterling s securities portfolio includes debt and equity instruments that are subject to varying degrees of credit and market risk 
this risk arises from general market conditions  factors impacting specific industries  as well as corporate news that may impact specific issues 
management continuously monitors its debt securities  including routine updating of credit ratings  monitoring market  industry and corporate news  as well as volatility in market prices 
sterling uses various indicators in determining whether a debt security is other than temporary impaired  including whether it is probable that the contractual interest and principal will not be collected in full 
one such indicator is credit ratings 
as of december   there were no holdings below investment grade

loans as of december   loans outstanding totaled  an increase of  or  over s balance of  excluding the loans acquired in connection with the pennsylvania state bank acquisition of  loans increased by 
over the past five years  sterling has been able to generate loan growth through acquisition of companies  including pennsylvania state bank in december  and equipment finance llc in february  and through entrance into new markets  including berks county  pennsylvania  carroll county  maryland  and new castle county  delaware 
in addition  the improvement in the local and national economies and our relationship management model has led to organic growth within the existing franchises 
a more thorough discussion follows 
commercial and agricultural and commercial real estate loans have increased from  at december  to  at december   an increase of 
pennsylvania state bank  which focuses on commercial relationships  brought  of loans to sterling  representing nearly half the increase 
additional growth has come from sterling s emerging markets and the improvement in the economy has allowed our customers to fund capital expenditures 
the hiring of additional experienced commercial lenders also contributed to the growth 
in the latter half of  sterling introduced correspondent services group to serve the needs of financial institutions in the mid atlantic region 
as a result of the introduction of correspondent services  we have seen the loans to financial institutions grow to  at december   as compared to  in and  in despite the low interest rate environment experienced over the last several years  a significant amount of the new loan origination volume has been sold on the secondary market  in connection with our corporate wide asset liability management 
as a result of the strong demand in other loan categories  sterling has allowed the mortgage loan portfolio to run off over the past few years 
consumer loans have also benefited from the low interest rate environment and have experienced strong growth in the past three years 
in addition  targeted advertising campaigns to certain consumer segments have promoted home equity products 
the specialty lenders  including equipment finance and town country leasing  have continued their momentum of growing finance receivables and finance leases  achieving growth in a primary reason for equipment finance s decision to join sterling was the funding that sterling could provide in order to increase its market share 
since sterling s acquisition in february  equipment finance has been able to capture new business and increase its finance receivables outstanding 
town country leasing s additions to the sales force have led to new business opportunities  and similar to the growth in commercial loans  customers have made capital expenditures to benefit from the low interest rate environment 
a portion of the growth experienced in lease financing receivables is the result of certain customers  who in the past would prefer an operating lease  now favoring finance leases to capitalize on bonus accelerated tax depreciation 
table loan portfolio the following table sets forth the composition of sterling s loan portfolio as of the dates indicated december  commercial and agricultural commercial real estate financial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer finance receivables net of unearned income lease financing net of unearned income total table loan maturity and interest sensitivity the following table sets forth the maturity of the commercial loan portfolio as of december  after one within but within after five one year five years years total commercial and agricultural  financial and commercial real estate real estate construction loans subject to annual renewal provisions are included in the within one year category in the table above 
commercial loans due after one year totaling  have variable interest rates  while  have a fixed rate of interest for a period of time  and then convert to another interest rate 
the remaining  in commercial loans have fixed rates 
asset quality sterling s loan portfolios are subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated through prudent underwriting standards  on going credit review  and monitoring and reporting asset quality measures 
additionally  loan portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to a single industry or borrower  and requiring collateral also reduces sterling s credit risk 
sterling s commercial  consumer and residential mortgage loans are principally to borrowers in south central pennsylvania  northern maryland  and northern delaware 
as the majority of sterling s loans are located in this area  a substantial portion of the debtor s ability to honor their obligations may be affected by the level of economic activity in the market area 
sterling s finance receivables are primarily to customers in the eastern part of the united states to finance forestry and land clearing equipment 
non performing assets include nonaccrual and restructured loans  accruing loans past due days or more and other foreclosed assets 
sterling s general policy has been to cease accruing interest on loans when management determines that a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of additional interest 
when management places a loan on nonaccrual status  it reverses unpaid interest credited to income in the current year  and charges unpaid interest accrued in prior years to the allowance for loan losses 
sterling recognizes income on these loans only to the extent that it receives cash payments 
sterling typically returns nonaccrual loans to performing status when the borrower brings the loan current and performs in accordance with contractual terms for a reasonable period of time 
sterling categorizes a loan as restructured if it changes the terms of the loan such as interest rate  repayment schedule or both  to terms that it otherwise would not have granted originally 
table nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the following table presents information concerning the aggregate amount of nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans december  nonaccrual loans accruing loans  past due days or more restructured loans total non performing loans foreclosed assets total non performing assets nonaccrual loans interest income that would have been recorded under original terms interest income recorded ratios non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total loans and foreclosed assets non performing assets to total assets as of december   non performing assets were  a decrease of  or from december  included in the totals are  of non performing assets acquired by sterling in connection with the acquisition of pennsylvania state bank in december sterling has experienced improvements in its asset quality ratios as a direct result of strong underwriting standards and diligence in managing past due and potential problem loans 
specifically  the improvements noted in were the result of the sales of foreclosed assets during the year  with little added to the foreclosed asset category 
additionally  several nonaccrual loans were charged off  or in one case  returned to accruing status 
the significant reduction noted in was principally centered around four relationships  which were either paid off in their entirety  had significant principal reductions  or were foreclosed on during and subsequently sold prior to the end of the year 
as a result  the nonaccrual loan balances were significantly lower at the end of potential problem loans are defined as performing loans  which have characteristics that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to perform under present loan repayment terms and which may result in the reporting of these loans as non performing loans in the future 
total potential problem loans were approximately  at december  and  at december  additionally  outstanding letter of credit commitments totaling approximately  could result in potential problem loans  if drawn upon 
the majority of these loans are secured by a combination of business assets and or real estate with acceptable loan to value ratios 
allowance for loan losses sterling maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
additionally  when sterling acquires a company in a purchase business combination  the acquired allowance is combined with sterling s existing allowance 
quarterly  sterling utilizes a defined methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this methodology considers specific credit reviews  past loan loss historical experience  and qualitative factors 
management assigns internal risk ratings to all commercial relationships with aggregate borrowings or commitments to extend credit in excess of  using migration analysis for the previous eight quarters  management develops a loss factor test  which it then uses to estimate losses on impaired loans  problem loans  potential problem loans and non classified loans 
when management finds loans with uncertain collectibility of principal and interest  it places those loans on the problem list  and evaluates them on a quarterly basis in order to estimate potential losses 
management s analysis considers adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of underlying collateral  and prevailing market conditions 
if management determines that a specific reserve allocation is not required  it assigns the general loss factor based on historical performance to determine the reserve 
for homogeneous loan types  such as consumer and residential mortgage loans  management bases specific allocations on the average loss ratio for the previous two years for each specific loan pool 
additionally  management adjusts projected loss ratios for other factors  including the following trends in delinquency levels  trends in non performing and potential problem loans  trends in composition  volume and terms of loans  effects in changes in lending policies or underwriting procedures  experience ability and depth of management  national and local economic conditions  concentrations in lending activities  and other factors as management may deem appropriate 
management determines the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses based on the following criteria risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocations  other potential exposures in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions  and other internal or external factors that management believes appropriate at that time 
management believes this methodology accurately reflects losses inherent in the portfolio 
management charges actual loan losses to the allowance for loan losses 
management periodically updates this methodology  which reduces the difference between actual losses and estimated losses 
management bases the provision for loan losses on the overall analysis taking the methodology into account 
a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses is as follows table summary of loan loss experience years ended december  beginning balance allowance acquired in acquisition loans charged off during year commercial and agricultural commercial real estate real estate mortgage consumer lease financing finance receivables total charge offs recoveries commercial and agricultural commercial real estate real estate mortgage consumer lease financing finance receivables total recoveries net loans charged off provision for loan losses reserve on loan commitments transferred to other liabilities balance at end of year ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding ending allowance for loan losses to net loans charged off x x x x x net loans charged off to provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans outstanding allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans the allowance for loan losses increased  from  at december   to  at december  the allowance was at of loans outstanding at december   and remains consistent with prior years 
despite the improvements in non performing assets  sterling increased its provision for loan losses to  for  as compared to  for the increase in the provision is consistent with the growth in the loan portfolio  and reflects certain qualitative factors  including a change in the methodology detailed in the next section of the report  increasing number of middle market credits and continued growth in lease and finance receivables 
table allocation of allowance for loan losses years ended december  loans loans loans loans loans to to to to to total total total total total amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage and construction consumer leases finance receivables unallocated total the allocation of the allowance for loan losses between the various loan portfolios has changed over the past few years  consistent with the historical net loss experience in each of the portfolios 
additionally  management periodically reviews the methodology  and may make revisions to ensure it continues to reflect the losses inherent in the portfolio 
during the third quarter of  management reevaluated and made certain modifications to its present methodology in establishing its reserve to account for changing risks inherent in its loan portfolio 
these modifications included the broadening of allocation percentages related to qualitative factors 
the basis for the widening of the allocation of qualitative factors included the following composition mix of the loan portfolio  which include greater percentages of commercial lending and leasing  and away from more traditional consumer loan types  greater instances of unsecured credits and credits secured by current assets  such as accounts receivable and inventory  and less instances of loans fully secured by real estate  geographic mix of loans  which includes entrance into emerging markets  where sterling has less experience and insight compared to its historical footprint  greater reliance on individual loan officers and credit personnel at the bank affiliates to enforce underwriting standards and policy  as decisions continue to be made in the markets served  rather than in a centralized location  and higher legal lending limits  allowing sterling to accommodate larger credit facilities with customers  which management believes carry a greater risk than smaller credits 
management believes this updated methodology accurately reflects losses presently inherent in the portfolio 
management charges actual loan losses to the allowance for loan losses and bases the provision for loan losses on the overall analysis taking the methodology into account 
to date  the changing composition of the loan portfolio has not yielded higher delinquency percentages or charge offs 
however  management s perception is there is an increasing level of losses inherent in the portfolio  and the widening of the qualitative risk allocation percentages was prudent in assessing this risk 
the largest reserve allocation is to the commercial  financial and agricultural loan portfolio  which represents approximately of the reserve balance 
this reflects the continued higher level of net charge offs  increases in loans  entering new markets with new lenders  and changes in other factors that impact the inherent risks in the portfolio 
this non homogeneous loan portfolio  along with leases  continues to represent the greatest risk exposure to sterling 
these loans generally are larger than the remainder of the portfolio and the related collateral is not as marketable 
additionally  other external factors  such as competition for high rated credits  is also considered in allocating this reserve balance 
the consumer loan allocation of the allowance for loan losses has increased the past two years  and reflects the increased charge offs experienced in this portfolio  as well as the portfolio s growing balance 
the increase in the charge offs impacts the quantitative reserve allocation  and portfolio growth impacts the qualitative factors 
during  the reserve allocation related to the lease portfolio has increased in comparison to prior periods 
this increase is consistent with the increasing net charge offs within the lease portfolio  as well as certain qualitative factors  including the uncertainty as to the impact of higher fuel costs on the transportation industry  and other factors that impact the inherent risk within the portfolio 
assets held for operating leases assets held for operating leases were  at december   which was consistent with the  at december  asset growth has been limited due to economic conditions  in which the low interest rate environment and bonus tax depreciation on personal property has resulted in a greater willingness of customers to enter into finance leases  or more traditional commercial lending arrangements 
operating leases have residual value risk associated with them 
operating lease terms  including monthly rental payment and length of the lease  are established based upon the residual value  or the estimate of fair value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term 
if  at the end of the lease term  the fair value of the leased property is less than the residual value calculated at lease origination  a loss on disposal could result 
sterling mitigates this risk through use of anticipated values published by various industries  and in some instances  discussions with industry experts 
further  the lease terms include provisions that the lessee shares the risk of loss on disposal of equipment  up to of the residual value 
deposits sterling continues to rely heavily on deposit growth as the primary source of funds for lending activities 
average deposits grew from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended  an increase of  or  similar trends were noted in compared to  in which average deposits grew 
the growth in deposits was almost exclusively in core deposits  including demand and savings accounts  while time deposit average balances have remained fairly consistent 
this growth in deposits has been achieved through the continued expansion of branch facilities into new markets  emphasis on the growth of business deposit relationships and the development of products that meet the needs of sterling s bank affiliate customers 
as a result of the improvements in the equity and mutual fund markets  as well as higher interest rates  sterling anticipates it may not be able to continue to generate deposit growth it has seen in the past few years  as investors may trade liquidity of their funds for higher yielding investments 
sterling will continue to explore new products to meet the needs of its customers 
table average deposit balances and rates paid the following table summarizes the average amounts of deposits and rates paid for the years indicated years ended december  amount rate amount rate amount rate non interest bearing demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits time deposits total table deposit maturity the following table summarizes the maturities of time deposits of  or more as of the dates indicated december  three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months total short term borrowings short term borrowings are comprised of federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  us treasury demand notes and borrowings from other financial institutions 
as of december   short term borrowings totaled  an increase of  from the december  balance of  this increase is primarily attributable to a shift in sterling s overnight federal funds position from selling federal funds to purchasing federal funds due 
this resulted from a strategy to fund a portion of loan growth over the past year with securities portfolio cash flow and overnight federal funds 
development of sterling s correspondent services group whereby federal funds lines have been established for a number of community bank clients 
at december  the balance of federal funds purchased from these relationships totaled  securities sold under repurchase agreements at pennsylvania state bank  sterling s newest affiliate  of  at december   with no corresponding balance in long term debt long term debt consists primarily of advances from the federal home loan bank and borrowings from other financial institutions to fund sterling s growth in its finance receivable and finance and operating lease portfolios 
long term debt totaled  at december   a net increase of  from the december  balance of  the net increase resulted primarily from the following debt assumed in the acquisition of the pennsylvania state banking company of  including a mark to market adjustment of  a  note payable to fund the acquisition of corporate healthcare strategies  llc  fixed rate advances from the federal home loan bank of  to provide funding for loan growth  fixed rate  amortizing borrowings of  from other financial institutions to provide funding for growth in finance receivables and finance and operating leases  and variable rate  amortizing borrowing of  from a financial institution to provide funding for growth in finance receivables and finance and operating leases 
offsetting these incremental borrowings were scheduled principal maturities and repayments of existing borrowings 
subordinated notes payable as of december   sterling sponsored three special purpose subsidiary trusts  sterling financial statutory trusts i  ii  and iii 
the trusts were formed for the purpose of issuing corporate obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities the capital securities to third party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of the capital securities in junior subordinated notes payable of sterling the debentures 
the debentures are the sole assets of the trust  and totaled  as of december   an increase of  the proceeds of the junior subordinate notes payable have been used to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid for recent acquisitions including pennsylvania state bank in  to fund a portion of the loan growth  and for other corporate matters 
in february  sterling sponsored a fourth special purpose subsidiary trust  sterling financial statutory trust iv 
the trust issued  of capital securities to third party investors  and simultaneously invested the proceeds into a  junior subordinated note payable to sterling 
the debenture bears interest at a fixed rate of and is due in february  with a call date of february derivative financial instruments sterling is a party to derivative instruments in the normal course of business to manage its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to meet the financing needs of its customers 
asset liability management sterling enters into derivative transactions principally to manage the risk of price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets and liabilities and on future cash flows 
a summary of the interest rate contracts is as follows december  december  notional carrying notional carrying amount value amount value interest rate swap agreements pay fixed receiving floating pay floating received fixed interest rate swaps have been used to hedge cash flow variability related to floating rate assets and liabilities 
gains and losses on derivative instruments reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to current period earnings are included in the line item in which the hedged cash flows are recorded 
at december   other comprehensive income included a deferred after tax unrealized loss of  versus  at december  a portion of the amount in other comprehensive income is reclassified from other comprehensive income to the appropriate income statement line item as net settlements occur  as follows years ended december  interest income commercial loans interest expense borrowed funds interest rate options  which include caps  are contracts that transfer  modify  or reduce interest rate risk in exchange for the payment of a premium when the contract is initiated 
a premium is paid for the right  but not the obligation  to buy or sell a financial instrument at predetermined terms in the future 
at december   the notional amount of an interest rate cap purchased was  and its carrying value was reduce to zero 
this interest rate cap expired in in may  sterling entered into two equity put options as fair value hedges to protect sterling from risk that the fair value of its slm corporation stock might be adversely impacted by the changes in market price 
the two equity put options each cover  shares of slm s stock  one with a valuation date in may that has since expired with no payment due  and the second with a valuation date of may if  at the valuation date  the stock price is below the reference price  the counter party will pay the difference between the stock s price on the valuation date and its reference price to sterling 
sterling paid  for these two put options 
as of december  the fair value was  versus  at december  this change was charged to other non interest expense 
at december   the trading price of the slm corporation stock was 
customer related beginning in the third quarter of  sterling entered into interest rate contracts including interest rate caps and interest rate swap agreements to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs 
this portfolio is actively managed and hedged with offsetting contracts  with identical terms  with third party counterparties 
a summary of the customer related interest rate contracts and offsetting contracts with third party counterparties is as follows december  december  notional carrying notional carrying amount value amount value interest rate swap agreements pay fixed receiving floating pay floating received fixed interest rate caps written interest rate caps purchased changes in the estimated fair value of customer related contracts and related interest settlements  net of the offsetting counterparty contracts  are recorded in non interest income 
fees collected from customers for these transactions are recognized over the life of the contract 
for the years ended december  and  fees of  and  are included in other non interest income 
sterling believes it has reduced market risk on its customer related derivative contracts through the offsetting contractual relationships with counterparties 
however  if a customer or counterparty fails to perform  credit risk is equal to the extent of the fair value gain in a derivative 
when the fair value of a derivative instrument contract is positive  this generally indicates that the counterparty or customer owes sterling  and results in credit risk to sterling 
when the fair value of a credit risk is negative  sterling owes the customer or counterparty  and therefore  has no credit risk 
sterling minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by including derivative credit risk in its credit underwriting procedures  and by entering into transactions with a high quality counterparties that are reviewed periodically by sterling s treasury department 
capital the management of capital in a regulated financial services industry must properly balance return on equity to stockholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels and related risk based capital ratios to satisfy regulatory requirements 
additionally  capital management must also consider acquisition opportunities that may exist  and the resulting accounting treatment 
sterling s capital management strategies have been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to stockholders  while maintaining its well capitalized position at each of the banking subsidiaries 
one capital management strategy that sterling has employed is the use of trust preferred capital securities through its wholly owned special purpose subsidiary trusts  sterling financial statutory trust i  ii and iii 
the proceeds from the preferred securities were invested in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of sterling  at terms consistent with the trust preferred capital securities 
sterling s treatment of the preferred capital securities is consistent with long term debt  and the related dividends being presented as interest expense 
sterling s obligations under the debentures and related documents  taken together  constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by sterling of the statutory trusts obligations under the preferred capital securities 
the capital securities held by the trusts qualify as tier capital for sterling under federal reserve board guidelines 
in  the federal reserve issued rules that retain tier capital treatment for trust preferred securities but with stricter limits 
under the new rules  after a five year transition period  the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements would retain its current limit of percent of tier capital elements  net of goodwill 
the amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit could be included in tier capital  subject to restrictions 
sterling has  in trust preferred securities as of december   which has been included as tier capital in its regulatory capital calculations 
sterling anticipates that upon adoption of the board of governors clarified regulatory treatment of trust preferred securities through  it will continue to be well capitalized 
earnings retention  net income less dividends declared  is another source of capital to sterling 
during  sterling retained  or  of its net income 
in addition  approximately  of capital was generated and used to purchase corporate healthcare strategies  inc and pennsylvania state bank 
in may  sterling s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of its common stock 
shares repurchased are held for reissue in connection with sterling s stock compensation plans and for general corporate purposes 
during and  sterling repurchased  and  shares of its common stock  at an average price of under this repurchase plan 
as of december    shares remain authorized for repurchase 
sterling and its banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on sterling and the subsidiary banks financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  sterling and its banking subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and reclassifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require sterling and its banking subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to average assets 
management believes  as of december  and  that sterling and the subsidiary banks met all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
as of december   the most recent notification from the federal deposit insurance corporation  the banks were categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
to be categorized as well capitalized institutions must maintain minimum total risk based  tier risk based and tier leverage ratios as set forth in the following tables 
there are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the banks category 
sterling s and the banks actual capital amounts and ratios as of december   and are also presented in the table 
table risked based capital sterling s actual capital amounts and ratios are as follows minimum capital actual capital requirement amount ratio amount ratio december  total capital to risked weighted assets tier capital to risked weighted assets tier capital to average assets december  total capital to risked weighted assets tier capital to risked weighted assets tier capital to average assets sterling s total and tier capital to risk weighted asset ratios as of december  have declined since  principally as a result of the intangible assets that resulted from the acquisitions of pennsylvania state bank and corporate healthcare strategies 
regulatory capital excludes intangible assets  resulting in lower capital ratios 
liquidity effective liquidity management ensures that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as the operating cash needs of sterling are met 
sterling s funds are available from a variety of sources  including assets that are readily convertible to cash federal funds sold  short term investments  securities portfolio  scheduled repayments of loan receivables  core deposit base  short term borrowing capacity with a number of correspondent banks and the federal home loan bank fhlb  the ability to package residential mortgage loans originated for sale  and through our correspondent bank relationships  the ability to sell finance leases 
as of december   sterling has unused funding commitments from these financial institutions and the fhlb totaling  the liquidity of the parent company also represents an important aspect of liquidity management 
the parent company s net cash outflows consist principally of dividends to shareholders and unallocated corporate expenses 
the main source of funding for the parent company is the dividends it receives from its subsidiaries 
federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid to the parent company from the subsidiary banks 
the total amount of dividends that may be paid from the subsidiary banks to sterling total  at december  sterling manages liquidity by monitoring projected cash inflows and outflows on a daily basis  and believes it has sufficient funding sources to maintain sufficient liquidity under varying degrees of business conditions 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements sterling enters into contractual obligations in its normal course of business to fund loan growth  for asset liability management purposes  to meet required capital needs and for other corporate purposes 
the following table presents significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due in total note amount one year or one to three to over five reference committed less three years five years years deposits without a stated maturity time deposits federal funds purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements interest bearing demand notes issued to the us treasury lines of credit long term debt subordinated notes payable operating leases sterling is a party to derivative instruments in the normal course of business  to assist in asset liability management and reduce exposure in earnings volatility caused by fluctuations in interest and market conditions and to meet the financing needs of its customers 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts or payments based on market and interest rate conditions as of the balance sheet date 
the fair values of the contracts can change daily as market and interest rate conditions fluctuate 
these derivative contracts require monthly cash settlement 
as the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet do not represent the amounts that will ultimately be paid under the contract  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations discussed above 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
a schedule of significant commitments at december  is as follows commitments to extend credit unused home equity lines of credit other commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit further discussion of these commitments to extend credit is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  sterling has commitments and obligations under employee benefit plans as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sterling has no off balance sheet arrangements through the use of special purpose entities 
new financial accounting standards note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the expected impact on sterling s financial condition or results of operations for recently issued or proposed accounting standards that have not been adopted 
to the extent we anticipate a significant impact to sterling s financial condition or results of operations  appropriate discussion takes place in the applicable note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial institutions can be exposed to several market risks that may impact the value or future earnings capacity of an organization 
these risks involve interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk and equity market price risk 
sterling s primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is inherent because as a financial institution  sterling derives a significant amount of its operating revenue from purchasing funds customer deposits and borrowings at various terms and rates 
these funds are then invested into earning assets loans  leases  investments  etc 
at various terms and rates 
this risk is further discussed below 
equity market risk is not a significant risk to sterling  as equity investments on a cost basis comprise less than of corporate assets 
sterling does not have any exposure to foreign currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the exposure to fluctuations in the corporation s future earnings earnings at risk and value value at risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
this exposure results from differences between the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that reprice within a specified time period as a result of scheduled maturities and repayment  contractual interest rate changes  or the exercise of explicit or embedded options 
the primary objective of sterling s asset liability management process is to maximize current and future net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate risk while satisfying liquidity and capital requirements 
management recognizes that a certain amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate yet is not essential to sterling s profitability 
thus  the goal of interest rate risk management is to maintain a balance between risk and reward such that net interest income is maximized while risk is maintained at a tolerable level 
management endeavors to control the exposures to changes in interest rates by understanding  reviewing and making decisions based on its risk position 
sterling s asset liability committee is responsible for these decisions 
sterling primarily uses the securities portfolios and borrowings to manage its interest rate risk position 
additionally  pricing  promotion and product development activities are directed in an effort to emphasize the loan and deposit term or repricing characteristics that best meet current interest rate risk objectives 
finally  sterling has utilized off balance sheet instruments to a limited degree to manage its interest rate risk position 
the committee operates under management policies defining guidelines and limits on the level of risk 
these policies are approved by the board of directors 
sterling uses simulation analysis to assess earnings at risk and net present value analysis to assess value at risk 
these methods allow management to regularly monitor both the direction and magnitude of the corporation s interest rate risk exposure 
these modeling techniques involve assumptions and estimates that inherently cannot be measured with complete precision 
key assumptions in the analyses include maturity and repricing characteristics of both assets and liabilities  prepayments on amortizing assets  other imbedded options  non maturity deposit sensitivity and loan and deposit pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
however  the analyses are useful in quantifying risk and provide a relative gauge of sterling s interest rate risk position over time 
earnings at risk simulation analysis evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months 
the resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of the corporation s shorter term interest rate risk 
the analysis utilizes a static balance sheet approach 
the measurement date balance sheet composition or mix is maintained over the simulation time period  with maturing and repayment dollars being rolled back into like instruments for new terms at current market rates 
additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under the various rate scenarios 
these include prepayment assumptions on mortgage assets  the sensitivity of non maturity deposit rates  and other factors deemed significant 
the simulation analysis results are presented in table a 
these results indicate that sterling would expect net interest income to increase over the next twelve months by assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of and to decrease by if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
this profile reflects an asset sensitive short term rate risk position and is within the guidelines set by policy 
at december   annual net interest income was expected to increase by in the upward scenario and to decrease by in the downward scenario 
the risk position has changed from the prior year end to a less asset sensitive position primarily due to a shift to a net federal funds purchased position  growth in rate sensitive deposit accounts and the  of receive fixed pay floating interest rate swaps entered into in offset by continued growth in variable commercial loans and extension of certificate of deposit maturities 
value at risk the net present value analysis provides information on the risk inherent in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the simulation analysis due to the shorter time horizon used in that analysis 
the net present value of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of expected asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of the expected liability cash flows 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining the expected cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in net present value in various rate scenarios is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
the net present value analysis results are presented in table b 
these results indicate that the net present value would decrease assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of and to decrease if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
the risk position of sterling is within the guidelines set by policy 
at december   the analysis indicated that the net present value would be unchanged assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of and to decrease if rates shifted downward in the same manner
