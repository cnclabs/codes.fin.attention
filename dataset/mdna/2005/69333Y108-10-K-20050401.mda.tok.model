historically  pf chang s has experienced variability in the amount and percentage of revenues attributable to preopening expenses 
we typically incur the most significant portion of preopening expenses associated with a given restaurant within the two months immediately preceding and the month of the opening of the restaurant 
additionally  there may be variability in the amount and percentage of revenues attributable to partner investment expense as a result of the timing of opening new restaurants and the timing of purchasing partner interests 
partner investment expense represents the difference between the imputed fair value of our partners ownership interests and our partners cash capital contribution for these interests  as well as the excess  if any  of the purchase price at the time we repurchase a partner s interest over the imputed fair value of that interest 
in addition  our experience to date has been that labor and operating costs associated with a newly opened restaurant  for approximately its first four to six months of operation  are materially greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
accordingly  the volume and timing of new restaurant openings has had and is expected to continue to have  a meaningful impact on preopening expenses  labor  operating and partner investment costs until such time as a larger base of restaurants in operation mitigates such impact

our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our cash flow from operations together with our current cash reserves will be sufficient to fund our projected capital requirements through in the event that additional capital is required  we will first access our existing credit facility 
in the unlikely event that additional capital is required  we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity or debt financing

if we purchase all of these interests in  the estimated financial impact would be an increase to earnings per share of based upon the elimination of the related minority interest charge in our income statement  partially offset by the anticipated intangible amortization expense relating to the purchase  both net of related income taxes 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require significant judgment 

table of contents lease obligation pf chang s leases all of its restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we took possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally include construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in store opening will result in greater rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
partnership structure pf chang s utilizes a partnership structure to facilitate the development  leadership and operation of its restaurants 
each partner who wishes to participate in the partnership structure is required to make a cash capital contribution in exchange for a specified interest in the partnership 
the ownership interest purchased by each partner generally ranges between two and seven percent of the restaurant or region the partner oversees 
we perform an assessment of what the imputed fair value of these interests might be for a passive equity investor ie not someone actually working in the restaurant utilizing a discounted cash flow model and updated assumptions based on the results of a annual valuation analysis performed by a third party 
this methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required 
any excess of the imputed fair value of these interests  determined by using the discounted cash flow model  over the cash contribution paid by our partners is currently recognized as expense upon purchase of the respective interest 
at the end of a specific term generally five years  pf chang s has the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the minority partner s interest in the partner s respective restaurant or region at fair value 
the estimated fair value for such purchases and sales is determined by reference to current industry purchase metrics as well as the historical cash flows of the subject restaurant s or region s financial results 
we have the option to pay the agreed upon purchase price in cash or common stock of pf chang s over a period of time not to exceed five years 
given that there is no public market for these interests  the fair value determinations are subjective and require the use of various estimates for which significant judgments are required 
if and when we repurchase our partners interests  the excess  if any  of the purchase price over the imputed fair value of these interests has been recognized as expense in the month the repurchase occurs for all fiscal years prior to and including now that the modifications to our agreements as discussed in risk factors have been in effect for six months  the excess  if any  will be recorded as intangibles which are amortized over approximately years for bistros and five years for pei weis 
there is also the possibility of additional charges relating to the modification if  within the initial five year period of the respective interest  we repurchase that interest at a value greater than required by the agreements prior to modification 
impairment of long lived assets we review property and equipment which includes leasehold improvements and intangibles with finite lives those assets resulting from the acquisition of minority interests in the operating rights of certain of our restaurants for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired  but at least quarterly 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
the analysis is performed at the restaurant  or partnership level for indicators of permanent impairment 
judgments and estimates made related to long lived assets are affected by factors such as economic conditions  changes in historical resale values and changes in operating performance 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 

table of contents self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our current and prior years exposures related to our workers compensation  general liability  medical and dental programs 
in estimating our self insurance reserves  we have contracted with two third party actuaries who assist us in determining the appropriate reserve amounts 
these third parties utilize estimates of expected losses  based on statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as our own estimates based on pf chang s actual historical trends to arrive at their reserve amounts 
these assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
we currently accrue insurance expense within the actuarial range of expected future liability 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  reserves might not be sufficient and additional expense may be recorded 
actual experience could also be more favorable than these estimates  resulting in expense reductions 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state liabilities 
these estimates include  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time that we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
tax contingency reserves result from our estimates of potential liabilities resulting from differences between actual and audited results 
changes in the tax contingency reserve result from resolution of audits of prior year filings  the expiration of the statute of limitations  changes in tax laws and current year estimates for asserted and unasserted items 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law  both legislated and concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
significant changes in our estimates could adversely affect our reported results 
new accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas r on july  as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time  because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future as well as outstanding options not vested as of july  however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future 
table of contents because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
inflation the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food  labor  insurance and utility costs 
additionally  a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage can affect our labor costs 
increases in workers compensation and health insurance costs also affect our labor costs 
purchase commitments payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total the table above does not include obligations related to lease renewal option periods even if it is reasonably assured that we will exercise the related option 
in determining purchase obligations for this table we used our interpretation of the definition set forth in the sec final rule  disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  which states  a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the registrant and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
in applying this definition  we have only included purchase obligations to the extent the failure to perform would result in formal recourse against pf chang s 
accordingly  certain procurement arrangements that indicate we are to purchase future items are included  but only to the extent they include a recourse provision for our failure to purchase 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s management believes that the market risk associated with pf chang s market risk sensitive instruments as of january  is not material  and therefore  disclosure is not required
