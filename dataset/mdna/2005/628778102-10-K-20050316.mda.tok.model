item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the financial review which follows focuses on the factors affecting the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of nbt bancorp inc the registrant and its wholly owned subsidiaries  nbt bank  na the bank and nbt financial services  inc nbt financial  during and  in summary form  the preceding two years 
collectively  the registrant and its subsidiaries are referred to herein as the company 
net interest margin is presented in this discussion on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis 
average balances discussed are daily averages unless otherwise described 
the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of december  and and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  should be read in conjunction with this review 
amounts in prior period consolidated financial statements are reclassified whenever necessary to conform to the presentation 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions  in the application of certain accounting policies  about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
different amounts could be reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions were used in the application of these accounting policies 
the business of the company is providing commercial banking and financial services through its subsidiaries 
the company s primary market area is central and upstate new york and northeastern pennsylvania 
the company has been  and intends to continue to be  a community oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services 
the company s principle business is attracting deposits from customers within its market area and investing those funds primarily in loans and leases  and  to a lesser extent  in marketable securities 
the financial condition and operating results of the company are dependent on its net interest income which is the difference between the interest and dividend income earned on its earning assets and the interest expense paid on its interest bearing liabilities  primarily consisting of deposits and borrowings 
net income is also affected by provisions for loan and lease losses and noninterest income  such as service charges on deposit accounts  broker dealer fees  trust fees  and gains losses on securities sales  it is also impacted by noninterest expense  such as salaries and employee benefits  data processing  communications  occupancy  and equipment 
the company s results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards  and actions of regulatory agencies 
future changes in applicable laws  regulations  or government policies may have a material impact on the company 
lending activities are substantially influenced by the demand for and supply of housing  competition among lenders  the level of interest rates  the state of the local and regional economy  and the availability of funds 
the ability to gather deposits and the cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market interest rates  fees and terms on deposit products  as well as the availability of alternative investments including mutual funds and stocks 
critical accounting policies the company has identified two policies as being critical because they require management to make particularly difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
these policies relate to the allowance for loan and lease losses and pension accounting 
management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
while management s current evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses indicates that the allowance is adequate  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  the allowance would need to be increased 
for example  if historical loan and lease loss experience significantly worsened or if current economic conditions significantly deteriorated  additional provisions for loan and lease losses would be required to increase the allowance 
in addition  the assumptions and estimates used in the internal reviews of the company s nonperforming loans and potential problem loans has a significant impact on the overall analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
while management has concluded that the current evaluation of collateral values is reasonable under the circumstances  if collateral values were significantly lowered  the company s allowance for loan and lease policy would also require additional provisions for loan and lease losses 
management is required to make various assumptions in valuing its pension assets and liabilities 
these assumptions include the expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate  and the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
changes to these assumptions could impact earnings in future periods 
the company takes into account the plan asset mix  funding obligations  and expert opinions in determining the various rates used to estimate pension expense 
the company also considers the moody s aa corporate bond yields and other market interest rates in setting the appropriate discount rate 
in addition  the company reviews expected inflationary and merit increases to compensation in determining the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
while differences in these rate assumptions could alter pension expense  given not only past history and controls in place including use of expert opinions  it is not expected that such estimates could adversely impact pension expense 
the company s policy on the allowance for loan and lease losses and pension accounting is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a more detailed description of the allowance for loan and lease losses is included in the risk management section of this form k 
all significant pension accounting assumptions and detail is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
all accounting policies are important  and as such  the company encourages the reader to review each of the policies included in note to obtain a better understanding on how the company s financial performance is reported 
forward looking statements certain statements in this filing and future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission  in the company s press releases or other public or shareholder communications  or in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer  contain forward looking statements  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act 
these statements may be identified by the use of phrases such as anticipate  believe  expect  forecasts  projects  will  can  would  should  could  may  or other similar terms 
there are a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements include  among others  the following possibilities local  regional  national and international economic conditions and the impact they may have on the company and its customers and the company s assessment of that impact

overview the company had net income of million or per diluted share for  compared to net income of million or per diluted share for results were driven by several factors 
net interest income increased million or in compared to the increase in net interest income resulted mainly from an increase in average earning assets of  driven by an increase in average loans and leases for the period 
noninterest income increased million or compared to this increase resulted from increases in other income  bank owned life insurance boli income  service charges on deposit accounts and trust revenue 
offsetting the increases in net interest income and noninterest income was an increase in noninterest expense of million in compared to the increase in noninterest expense resulted mainly from increases in salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expense  professional fees and outside services and a goodwill impairment charge offset by decreases in other operating expense and loan collection and other real estate owned expense 
the provision for loan and lease losses increased slightly in compared to  as credit quality was stable  net charge offs as a percentage of total loans and leases remained unchanged  and loan growth was solid  increasing at december  when compared to total loans and leases at december  the company had net income of million or per diluted share for  compared to net income of million or per diluted share for there were several factors driving the improvement in results in compared to noninterest income increased million or in compared to this increase resulted from strong growth in service charges on deposit accounts and increases from trust revenue  broker dealer fees  bank owned life insurance boli income  and other income 
offsetting this increase in noninterest income was a decrease in net interest income of million and an increase in noninterest expenses of million 
the decrease in net interest income was driven primarily by the decrease in the company s net interest margin  which declined from for to for  primarily as a result of continued low market interest rates 
the decline in margin was offset some what by growth in average earning assets of driven primarily by loan growth 
average loans and leases increased in or million compared to average loans 
the increase in noninterest expense resulted primarily from increases in salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expense  and other noninterest expense offset by decreases in professional fees and outside services and loan collection and other real estate owned oreo expenses 
the provision for loan and lease losses remained relatively unchanged in from  as improvements in credit quality were offset by loan growth in asset liability management the company attempts to maximize net interest income  and net income  while actively managing its liquidity and interest rate sensitivity through the mix of various core deposit products and other sources of funds  which in turn fund an appropriate mix of earning assets 
the changes in the company s asset mix and sources of funds  and the resultant impact on net interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis  are discussed below 
the following table includes the condensed consolidated average balance sheet  an analysis of interest income expense and average yield rate for each major category of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a taxable equivalent basis

home equity loans increased million or from million at december  to million at december  the increase in home equity loans was due to strong product demand as the bank s prime lending rate which the home equity line product is tied to remained at historic lows for the first half of additionally  the bank was successful in marketing its home equity product in its newer markets 
real estate construction and development loans increased million or from million at december  to million at december   as the bank originated several large commercial construction development loans in in its newer markets 
lease financing increased million or from million at december  to million at december  the increase in lease financing resulted from the bank s expanded presence in the northeastern pennsylvania market in commercial loans and commercial real estate increased million or from million at december  to billion at december   as the bank continued to expand its commercial banking presence in albany  binghamton  and northeastern pennsylvania 
the following table reflects the loan and lease portfolio by major categories as of december for the years indicated table composition of loan and lease portfolio december  in thousands residential real estate mortgages commercial and commercial real estate real estate construction and development agricultural and agricultural real estate consumer home equity lease financing total loans and leases real estate mortgages consist primarily of loans secured by first or second deeds of trust on primary residences 
loans in the commercial and agricultural category  as well as commercial and agricultural real estate mortgages  consist primarily of short term and or floating rate loans made to small to medium sized entities 
consumer loans consist primarily of installment credit to individuals secured by automobiles and other personal property including manufactured housing 
real estate construction and development loans include million in commercial construction and development and million in residential construction loans 
commercial construction loans are for small and medium sized office buildings and other commercial properties and residential construction loans are primarily for projects located in upstate new york and northeastern pennsylvania 
the company s automobile lease financing portfolio totaled million at december  and million at december  lease receivables primarily represent automobile financing to customers through direct financing leases and are carried at the aggregate of the lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values  net of unearned income and net deferred lease origination fees and costs 
net deferred lease origination fees and costs are amortized under the effective interest method over the estimated lives of the leases 
the estimated residual value related to the total lease portfolio is reviewed quarterly  and if there had been a decline in the estimated fair value of the residual that is judged by management to be other than temporary  including consideration of residual value insurance  a loss would be recognized 
adjustments related to such other than temporary declines in estimated fair value are recorded with other noninterest expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
one of the most significant risks associated with leasing operations is the recovery of the residual value of the leased vehicles at the termination of the lease 
a lease receivable asset includes the estimated residual value of the leased vehicle at the termination of the lease 
at termination  the lessor has the option to purchase the vehicle or may turn the vehicle over to the company 
the residual values included in lease financing receivables totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company has acquired residual value insurance protection in order to reduce the risk related to residual values 
based on analysis performed by management  the company has concluded that no other than temporary impairment exists which would warrant a charge to earnings during december  and the following table  maturities and sensitivities of certain loans to changes in interest rates  are the maturities of the commercial and agricultural and real estate and construction development loan portfolios and the sensitivity of loans to interest rate fluctuations at december  scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category in which the contractual payment is due

at december   the mix was fifteen ten year mortgage backed securities and thirty twenty year mortgaged backed securities 
furthermore  the company shortened the estimated weighted average life of the total securities portfolio from years at december  to years at december  in the event of a rising rate environment  the company should be positioned to reinvest cash flows at a faster rate from shortening the expected life of the portfolio 
the average balance of securities held to maturity decreased from million in to million in at december   securities held to maturity were comprised primarily of tax exempt municipal securities 
the yield on securities held to maturity decreased slightly from in to in investments in frb and federal home loan bank fhlb stock increased to million in from million in this increase was driven primarily by an increase in the investment in fhlb resulting from an increase in the company s borrowing capacity at fhlb 
the yield from investments in frb and fhlb banks declined from in to in in  the fhlb disclosed it had capital concerns and credit issues in their investment security portfolio 
as a result of these issues  the fhlb suspended a quarterly dividend payment in and reduced their dividend rate in the company classifies its securities at date of purchase as either available for sale  held to maturity or trading 
held to maturity debt securities are those that the company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost 
trading securities are recorded at fair value  with net unrealized gains and losses recognized currently in income 
transfers of securities between categories are recorded at fair value at the date of transfer 
a decline in the fair value of any available for sale or held to maturity security below cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged to earnings resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
securities with an other than temporary impairment are generally placed on non accrual status 
non marketable equity securities are carried at cost  with the exception of small business investment company sbic investments  which are carried at fair value in accordance with sbic rules 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the interest method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned
