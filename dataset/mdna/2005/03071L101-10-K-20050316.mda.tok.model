item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of amerivest as of and for the years ended december   and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contained in the annual report on form k 
executive summary we are a reit which owns and operates commercial office buildings in select markets catering to small and medium size businesses 
at december   we owned properties totaling  square feet 
the company s core portfolio which excludes assets it owns less than and smaller office buildings primarily leased to the state of texas included properties totaling  square feet  at december   located in metropolitan denver  dallas  phoenix and indianapolis 
we generate revenue primarily through the rental of office space at our properties 
key factors that affect our business and financial results are as the follows the current economic environment in metropolitan denver  dallas  phoenix and indianapolis  the occupancy rates at our properties  the rental rates on our properties  tenant improvement and leasing costs incurred to obtain or retain tenants  and the extent of early lease termination and any lease termination fees 
in november  the company announced that it had retained bear  stearns co  inc to assist our board of directors in undertaking a review of a broad range of strategic alternatives for the company 
these alternatives include identifying an institutional capital partner to assist in the company s long term growth plans  a sale or recapitalization of all or a portion of the company s properties  the potential sale or merger of the company  and other possible transactions designed to enhance shareholder value 
with the assistance of bear stearns  the board is evaluating the company s strategic alternatives  however  such an evaluation may not result in a transaction of any kind 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the strategic direction of the company  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed  forecasted  or implied 
results of operations same store property results the company defines the same store population as properties that were fully operating during each respective comparison period 
we believe the same store comparison is helpful as it demonstrates the population s performance on a year over year basis 
we have seven properties in our same store population for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in the financial results from these properties  as well as the occupancy and average rent per square foot are as follows twelve months ended december  change change real estate operating revenue rental revenue    real estate operating expenses property operating expenses operating expenses    real estate taxes    total property operating expenses   net operating income    average rent per sq 
foot at december  occupancy at december  during  same store portfolio occupancy increased from to  however  the average rent on the new leases was  in many cases  less than the average rent on existing leases  resulting in a decline in average rent per square foot of 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  we increased our revenues and expenses significantly by adding approximately  square feet  or  to our portfolio through the acquisition of four properties during  combined with the inclusion of the operations of our acquisitions for a full year 
for a discussion regarding the acquired properties  see item  and transactions 
the following represent our operating results for and change real estate operating revenue rental revenue    real estate operating expenses property operating expenses operating expenses    real estate taxes    general and administrative expenses   interest expense    depreciation and amortization expense   impairment of investment in real estate   other expenses    total operating expense    loss from continuing operations    other income loss interest income    equity in loss of affiliate    minority interest   total other income    loss before discontinued operations   discontinued operations    net loss    rental revenue rental revenue increased by approximately million  or  in as compared to approximately million of the increase is due to the inclusion of the operating results from the acquisitions camelback lakes  hackberry view  parkway centre iii and hampton court and approximately million is due to the inclusion of the acquisitions southwest gas building  greenhill park  scottsdale norte and financial plaza for a full year in versus a partial year in approximately  of the remaining increase is due to the consolidation of panorama falls due to the adoption of fin r whereby its operations are included with those of the company beginning march  we anticipate that rental revenues will continue to increase in due to the acquisitions and improved occupancy and more favorable rental rates  however  a portion of any rental revenue increase will be offset by rental rate roll down in expiring leases 
the total portfolio occupancy was at december  as compared to at december  this increase is primarily due to the acquisitions  which were occupied at december   and accounted for of the increase in occupancy 
property operating expenses property operating expenses operating expenses  real estate taxes  and ground lease expense increased by approximately million  or  in as compared to approximately million of the increase is due to the inclusion of the acquisitions and approximately million is due to the acquisitions operating for a full year in versus a partial year in in addition  of the remaining increase   of the increase is due to the ground lease expense on greenhill park and approximately  is due to the consolidation of panorama falls in real estate taxes  which are the largest component of property operating expenses  increased from approximately million in to approximately million in  both of which represent approximately of revenue 
the and acquisitions represent approximately million of the increase 
based on our experience  upon acquisition  a property is often reassessed by the local municipalities at the purchase price and real estate taxes increase accordingly 
while the company utilizes outside property tax consulting firms to protest the valuations of any properties that are deemed to be overvalued  it records the actual expense in the year incurred with any amounts refunded to the company through this process recorded when realized 
during the latter half of and first quarter of  the company hired regional personnel in the denver  dallas and phoenix markets 
the company believes it is important to its strategy to self manage its properties with experienced management in the local markets 
the company focuses on the control of operating expenses  however  we anticipate that operating expenses will continue to increase in this increase will be partially offset by the decrease in ground lease expense  due to the acquisition of the greenhill park land subject to the ground lease in october general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased approximately  or  in as compared to approximately  of the increase is related to audit  legal and consulting fees primarily incurred by the company s efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of the remainder of the increase is principally due to the addition of corporate personnel hired during the latter half of and in to support the continued growth of the company 
these increases are partially offset by approximately  in severance incurred during  which did not occur in the company anticipates a slight decrease in general and administrative expenses during primarily due to lower fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
interest expense interest expense increased approximately million  or  in as compared to the increase is primarily due to the borrowings the company incurred for acquisitions during and late and the million increase in capital and tenant improvements during as compared to for which the company borrowed on the unsecured facility 
the increase in interest expense is also attributable to higher interest rates on the company s lines of credit during during  the company increased the capacity of the unsecured facility from million to million and replaced the facility fee with a one time commitment fee that is being amortized into interest expense over the life of the loan agreement 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased approximately million  or  in as compared to the increase in depreciation was a result of our acquisitions during and the company also anticipates an increase of approximately million in depreciation and amortization for due to the recent acquisitions 
furthermore  the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which  among other things  requires an allocation of the purchase price of a property to an intangible asset representing the value associated with the in place leases  has had and will continue to have a significant impact on the company s depreciation and amortization expense as additional properties are acquired 
the intangible assets are amortized over the remaining life of the in place leases which generally range from to months 
impairment of investment in real estate the million impairment recorded during the twelve months ended december  relates to certain of the texas state buildings located in lubbock  el paso  temple  bellville  columbus  hempstead  mission  arlington  marshall  and amarillo  texas the company previously recognized impairments on the remaining two buildings in clint and paris  texas see below 
impairment charges recorded on the texas state building portfolio reduced the total net book value to the properties total estimated fair value of million  excluding certain deposits maintained by the lender 
the company calculated the estimated fair value using probability weighted forecasted cash flows 
subsequent to year end  the company entered into negotiations with the lender to return the properties in lieu of the debt balance 
this transaction was completed in march other expense the  increase in other expense is due to costs  such as non refundable earnest money deposits and legal costs  which were previously capitalized in connection with anticipated acquisitions 
these pursuits were terminated during the fourth quarter of and all capitalized costs associated with these acquisitions were expensed 
discontinued operations in march  the company sold its texas bank buildings for million and recognized a net gain of  in accordance with sfas no 
 the company has classified the operations of these properties  as well as the gain on disposition  as discontinued operations 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  we increased our revenues and expenses significantly by adding approximately  square feet to our portfolio through the acquisition of four properties during  combined with the inclusion of the operations of our acquisitions for a full year 
change real estate operating revenue rental revenue    real estate operating expenses property operating expenses operating expenses    real estate taxes    general and administrative expenses   advisory and capital projects fees   interest expense    depreciation and amortization expense   impairment of investment in real estate   other expenses    total operating expense    loss from continuing operations    other income loss interest income    equity in loss of affiliate    total other income    loss before discontinued operations   discontinued operations    net loss    rental revenue rental revenue increased by approximately million  or  in as compared to approximately million of the increase is due to the inclusion of the operating results from the acquisitions southwest gas  financial plaza  scottsdale norte and greenhill park and approximately million is due to the inclusion of the operating results from the acquisitions parkway centre ii  centerra and chateau plaza for a full year in versus a partial year in offsetting these increases is a decrease of approximately  due to a decline in our same store properties occupancy rate combined with a weak rental market  which negatively impacted rental revenue 
a majority of the decline in the existing portfolio was experienced in the denver market where the soft economy forced some tenants to downsize or go out of business 
the remaining decrease of approximately  was due to the loss of the tenant  an agency of the state of texas  at our paris  texas property in december the total portfolio occupancy rate was at december   a decline from at december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the acquisitions  which were approximately occupied at year end  however  the above mentioned decline in our existing portfolio occupancy rate also contributed to the overall decline in occupancy 
property operating expenses property operating expenses increased by approximately million  or  in as compared approximately million of the increase is due to the inclusion of the acquisitions and approximately million is due to the inclusion of the acquisitions for a full year in the remainder of the increase was experienced in our same store properties and non core properties 
the main components of the additional expense consisted of increases in real estate taxes  utilities and regional property management personnel 
real estate taxes increased from approximately million  or of revenue  in to approximately million  or of revenue  in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  in as compared to to support the continued growth of the company  we continued to incur additional general and administrative expenses  including salary  consulting  legal and accounting costs 
included in were charges of approximately  in compensation expense for bonuses to our chief executive officer  chief operating officer and chief investment officer as provided by the company s long term incentive plan  approximately  in severance expense to our former chief financial officer and approximately  in recruiting fees related to corporate and regional hires 
advisory and capital projects fee the advisory and capital projects fees expense recognized in represents the fees earned by sra  in accordance with the advisory agreement  for property acquisitions and as provided for in the termination of advisory agreement we executed with sra 
effective january   the advisory agreement was amended whereby certain sra employees became our employees and as a result  the advisory and capital project fees were expensed 
prior to january   these fees were capitalized 
additionally  due to the termination of the advisory agreement effective november  whereby all remaining sra employees became our employees  these fees have been eliminated 
beginning november   the salaries of these additional employees are included in general and administrative expenses 
interest expense interest expense increased by approximately million  or  in as compared to of this increase  approximately million relates to mortgage loans on the acquisitions and approximately million relates to mortgage loans on the acquisitions held for an entire year in in addition  approximately  of the increase is due to the refinancing of the sheridan center  arrowhead fountains and kellogg building variable rate loans with a weighted average rate of with a fixed rate portfolio loan with a fixed rate of 
although the refinancings have negatively impacted our results  we believe it was the proper course of action to have our long term assets financed with long term  fixed rate debt  which provides more stability and certainty 
the increase in interest expense is also attributable to the interest and fees related to the short term loan  which was used in the acquisition of the southwest gas building and later refinanced with the unsecured fleet facility 
depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is due to the increase in depreciable assets resulting from the above mentioned acquisitions 
impairment of investment in real estate during  the company recorded a  impairment charge for a  square foot building in clint  texas and a million impairment charge for a  square foot building in paris  texas 
both properties had been previously leased to agencies of the state of texas 
the clint building had been vacant since november and the paris building had been vacant since december the company recorded a  impairment charge related to the clint property in the company arrived at the estimated fair values using a combination of the property tax assessment values  values estimated by the our property tax consulting firms and local real estate brokers 
liquidity and capital resources our net cash provided by operating activities is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our properties  the rental rates on our leases  the collectibility of rent from our tenants  and the level of operating and other expenses 
our net cash provided by operating activities has been a significant source of liquidity to help fund debt service  capital improvements  tenant improvements and leasing costs for operating properties as well as distributions to our shareholders 
until our evaluation of strategic alternatives is competed  we do not plan to make any new acquisitions 
on march   the company amended its secured facility and unsecured facility with keybank due to the company not being in compliance with its leverage  interest coverage and fixed charge coverage covenants required by the secured facility 
the amendment to the secured facility involved i a waiver for the events of non compliance  noted above  as of december   ii changes to the debt covenant calculations to set them at the same levels as those previously established for the unsecured facility  iii mandatory repayments of at least million by july  and at least million by september   iv removal of the revolving feature of the secured facility  and v the elimination of the obligation of the lender to make any further loans under the secured facility 
the amendment to the unsecured facility involved i a waiver for the events of non compliance as of december  due to cross default provisions with the secured facility ii moving up the maturity date from november  to april   iii mandatory repayments of at least million by september and at least million by january  iv removal of the revolving feature of the unsecured facility  v a requirement that any further borrowings  including borrowings to pay dividends  be subject to the approval of the lender in its sole and absolute discretion  vi a limitation on the incurrence of any other indebtedness by the company without the prior written consent of the lender and vii a requirement that all net proceeds from a property sale  refinancing or other capital transaction be used to pay down any amounts outstanding 
on march   our board suspended the payment of the common dividend for the first quarter of the board determined that suspension of the dividend will maximize the company s ability to complete a strategic transaction in a timely manner 
the board intends to review and consider the resumption of a dividend for the second quarter of  or thereafter  based on a number of factors  including the completion of a strategic transaction or other significant capital event  such as refinancing or asset sales  the company s financial results  capital resources and liquidity needs at that time 
a material adverse change in our net cash provided by operating activities may affect our ability to fund the items listed above and may affect the financial performance covenants under our lines of credit 
if we fail to meet our financial performance covenants and to reach a satisfactory resolution with our lenders  our lines of credit could become unavailable to us or the interest charged on the line of credit could increase 
any of these circumstances could adversely affect our ability to fund working capital and unanticipated cash needs and development costs 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operations increased million  or  in as compared to and million  or  in as compared to these increases are primarily due to the inclusion of the operations from property acquisitions 
see results of operations for a more complete discussion of factors impacting our operating performance 
investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities increased million  or  in as compared to and million  or  in as compared to these increases are primarily due to the properties that were acquired during the period and the related capital improvement  tenant improvement and leasing commission costs incurred by the company relating to the and acquisitions 
during  the increase was partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of the texas bank buildings of approximately million 
financing activities net cash flows provided by financing activities increased million  or  in as compared to the increase is primarily due to an increase in net borrowings to finance our property acquisitions and proceeds from common stock offerings  which were partially used to pay down the company s secured and unsecured credit facilities 
the remainder of the change is primarily composed of scheduled principal payments on mortgage loans  dividend payments and payments into escrow accounts as required by certain lenders 
net cash flows provided by financing activities decreased million  or  in as compared to the change is primarily due to i greater loan pay downs from an increase in proceeds from our common stock offering in  ii increased dividend payments due to an increase in the number of shares outstanding which resulted from the mid and stock offerings  and iii increased payments into escrow accounts as required by certain lenders 
future sources of capital the following table summarizes future minimum base rent to be received under non cancelable tenant leases at december  for the company s commercial properties expiring each year over the next five years excludes the texas state buildings  see significant transactions transactions less than year years years over years total minimum rents     in january  the company filed a shelf registration statement under which the company could potentially raise up to million through the issuance of common stock or preferred stock 
at december   there was approximately million available in shelf registered securities 
the proceeds from those issuances  if any  would be used to acquire and improve new and existing properties  repay borrowings under our lines of credit or other loans and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the company has two credit facilities a million senior secured revolving line of credit with keybank secured facility  and a million unsecured revolving line of credit with keybank unsecured facility 
at december   the unsecured facility had a maturity date of november at december   there was million outstanding under the secured facility and million outstanding under the unsecured facility 
as noted above  as a result of the amendments to our secured facility and unsecured facility  our ability to borrow additional amounts under the secured facility has been terminated and our ability to incur additional borrowings under the unsecured facility is subject to the approval of the lender in its sole and absolute discretion 
moreover  the amendments to the unsecured facility restrict our ability to incur any additional indebtedness from any other party without the prior written consent of the lender 
to the extent that we are unable to borrow additional funds  we may be unable to make any additional acquisitions of office properties and could be limited in our ability to fund tenant improvements or make other necessary or desirable portfolio capital expenditures unless we issue additional equity in the company or sell one or more of our existing properties 
in addition  we would be dependent upon cash flow from our operations to cover these capital expenditures and our corporate operating expenses 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute our business plan  and our limited access to capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our operations 
subject to the results of its strategic alternatives review and the availability of capital  the company may seek to acquire additional properties 
in order to do so  we will try to utilize current sources of debt financing and possibly incur additional debt and or obtain additional equity capital 
the issuance of such securities or increase in debt to acquire additional properties  of which there is no assurance  could adversely affect the amount of cash available to pay dividends to stockholders 
due to the unknown outcome of the company s search for strategic alternatives  it is unclear whether we will be able to effectively access the public equity markets or incur additional debt at attractive rates 
future uses of capital  contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes the company s contractual commitments related to our debt outstanding at december  and and thereafter total secured mortgage loans and notes payable   unsecured line of credit   total     see future sources of capital for information on the amendments to the secured and unsecured facilities 
debt covenants certain of its mortgage lenders require the company to comply with certain debt covenants as described in the specific loan documents  including the loan to value ratio  the interest coverage ratio  the fixed charge coverage ratio and the dividend payout ratio 
at december   the company was not in compliance with any of its debt covenants as required by the secured and unsecured facilities  due to cross default provisions 
as previously noted  the company received a waiver from keybank national association with respect to this event of non compliance with these covenants for the year ended december  as a result of the amendments to the secured and unsecured facilities  the company believes that it will be able to comply with the revised covenants based on the budgeted results of operations 
in addition  the company believes it will meet its obligations under the mandatory repayments on the secured and unsecured facilities by either i completing a strategic transaction  which may include a sale or recapitalization of all or a portion of the company s assets or a merger of the company  ii obtaining additional financing by refinancing certain assets  or iii issuing equity 
if the company is unable to raise sufficient capital for the mandatory repayments  or if we are unable to remain in compliance with our debt covenants  the bank could accelerate and demand repayment of outstanding amounts based on the terms of the amended facilities agreements 
if this were to occur  the company may not be able to meet its obligations under the accelerated repayment obligations 
inflation management believes that inflation should not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our office leases require the tenants to pay increases in operating expenses should any inflationary pressures materialize

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  which would potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
investment in real estate upon acquisition  the purchase price of a property is allocated to land  building and improvements and other intangible assets and associated liabilities as required by sfas no 
business combinations 
the allocation to land is based on an estimate of its fair value based on all available information including appraisals 
the allocation to other intangible assets represents the value associated with the in place leases  including leasing commission  legal and other related costs 
also required by sfas no 
 is the creation of an intangible asset or liability resulting from in place leases being above or below the market rental rates on the date of acquisition 
this asset or liability is amortized over the life of the related in place leases as an adjustment to revenue 
investment in real estate is stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows description estimated useful lives land not depreciated buildings and improvements to years furniture  fixtures and equipment to years tenant improvements  tenant leasing commissions and other intangible assets term of related lease maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and improvements are capitalized 
the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation and or amortization are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations in the period in which such sale or retirement occurs 
allocating the purchase price of a property to the different components of investment in real estate  determining whether expenditures meet the criteria for capitalization and assigning depreciable lives is considered to be critical because it requires management to exercise significant judgment 
valuation of real estate assets long lived assets to be held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets based on estimated future cash flows from and the estimated liquidation value of such long lived assets  and provides for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
valuation of real estate assets is considered to be critical because the evaluation of impairment and the determination of fair values involve management s assumptions relating to future economic events that could materially affect the determination of the fair value  and therefore the carrying value of real estate 
revenue recognition certain leases provide for tenant occupancy during periods for which no rent is due or where minimum rent payments increase during the term of the lease 
rental revenue is recorded for the full term of each lease on a straight line basis 
accordingly  the company records a receivable from tenants for rents that it expects to collect over the remaining lease term as deferred rents receivable 
when the company acquires a property  the term of the existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation 
revenue recognition is considered to be critical because the evaluation of the realizability of such deferred rents receivable involves management s assumptions relating to such tenant s viability 
income taxes the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a reit under sections of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
the company intends to distribute to our shareholders of our taxable income 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is required 
if the company fails to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders  or fails to meet other reit requirements  we may fail to qualify as a reit and substantial adverse tax consequences may result 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates as a result of our secured and unsecured lines of credit 
at december   we had million of mortgage loans and notes payable including our lines of credit  or approximately of total market capitalization based on the common share price at december  our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for our borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangement 
at december   approximately of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed rated with a weighted average interest rate of 
we regularly review interest rate exposure on our outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the table below provides information about our liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date in thousands
