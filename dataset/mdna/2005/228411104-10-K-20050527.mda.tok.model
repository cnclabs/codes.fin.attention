subscribers include both viewers who pay a monthly fee for the tier programming and so called promotional subscribers who are given free access to the tier by the distributor for a limited time with the hope that they will eventually choose to subscribe and pay for the tier

stockholders agreement in item below and item below regarding beneficial ownership of our securities 
industry overview the pay television industry is comprised primarily of program suppliers  pay television channel providers and pay television distributors 
program suppliers  from whom we acquire or license a portion of our programming  include many of the major production studios and other independent production companies and independent owners of programming 
these program suppliers create  develop and finance the production of  or control rights to  movies  television miniseries  series and other programming 
due to our acquisition of the crown media library  we are a program supplier 
program suppliers generate revenue by licensing their programming to broadcasters and video distributors pay television channel providers around the world 
these licenses are typically specific by territory and are limited to a certain number of showings within specified periods of time 
we are also a pay television channel provider 
pay television channel providers include all channel providers except over the air broadcasters and major us networks 
pay television channel providers often produce programming and acquire or license programming from program suppliers and generally package the programming according to an overriding theme and brand strategy 
pay television providers and distributors generally restrict viewership through security encryption devices that limit viewership to paying subscribers 
pay television channel providers compete with each other for distribution and to attract viewers and advertisers 
pay television providers generally target audiences with a certain demographic composition  so that they can then sell advertising to advertisers seeking to reach the providers demographic audiences 
pay television distributors own and operate the platforms used to deliver channels to subscribers 
these distributors use several different technologies to reach their subscribers as described below 
distributors attempt to create a mix of channels that will be attractive to their subscriber population in an attempt to gain new subscribers and to reduce subscriber turnover 
distributors have different levels of service for subscribers  with each service level containing some different channels 
more recently  distributors  particularly in the us  have begun to offer additional broadband services such as internet access  telephony and video on demand over their systems 
as a result of the recently increased competition for limited analog channel space in the united states and increased use of the digital cable capacity for new broadband services  pay television channel providers are often required to pay subscriber acquisition fees to pay television distributors for carriage on their systems 
these subscriber acquisition fees are paid to television distributors on a per subscriber basis and generally in advance of any receipt of subscriber fee revenue from such pay television distributors 
distribution platforms four major distribution platforms are currently used to transmit programming 
first  cable television systems use coaxial or fiber optic cable to transmit multiple channels between a central facility  known as a headend  and the individual subscriber s television set 
second  analog and digital satellite broadcast systems such as direct to home or dth use satellite transponders to broadcast television programming to individual dwellings with satellite reception equipment  including a dish and a decoder 
third  digital terrestrial television broadcasters dtt typically broadcast locally or through regional or national ground based transmission networks 
in general  such broadcasters use landline  microwave or satellite transmission systems to distribute programming to terrestrial transmission facilities for broadcast directly to viewers homes 
finally  channels can also be distributed through satellite master antenna television smatv 
smatv is used primarily for buildings  such as apartments and hotels that receive programming from satellites by means of a single antenna that is connected to the buildings headend 
the television signals are then distributed to individual units in the building by cable 
sources of revenue subscriber fees pay television customers subscribe to basic services by paying monthly fees for basic channels to pay television distributors 
the customers can also subscribe to additional packages of premium or pay per view services upon payment of additional fees 
primarily in international markets  pay television distributors generally pay a fee per subscriber for all or some subscribers to channel providers 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
advertising revenue the advertising market differs greatly around the world 
in the united states  there is a growing sentiment among advertisers that advertising expenditures are shifting from broadcast television to cable television 
in other parts of the world  the amount spent by advertisers on television varies according to the development of each country s television market 
in general  advertising expenditures are less in other countries than in the united states  both in terms of percentage of advertising expenditures as well as absolute dollars 
program ratings systems in many non united states markets are growing rapidly  and as a result  advertisers are relying less on subscriber counts and more on empirical measurements when buying advertising time 
television advertising is sold in a variety of formats 
many pay television channels rely largely upon the spot advertisement format 
spot advertisements are normally seconds long and air during or between programs 
they are often sold in packages of a certain number of spots or to deliver a certain number of viewers 
an alternative to spot advertising is sponsorship  by which a company sponsors a program or selection of programs on a channel by applying their branding around the programming 
the ability of a television channel to generate advertising revenue largely depends on estimated or actual viewing levels  primarily based on ratings  and on advertising rates 
typically  in the united states and some other markets  independent ratings systems on which advertising sales can be based are well established and widely accepted within the industry 
in addition  pay television channel providers and distributors may also provide estimated or actual subscriber information 
our us channel sells the majority of its advertising in the up front season  generally in august  for the last quarter of the same year and the first three quarters of the following year 
we hold back a small percentage of our inventory for audience deficiency units  adus  and sell the remainder in the spot market 
adus are units of inventory that are made available to advertisers as compensation for inventory the advertiser purchased that ran in programs that under delivered on the guaranteed ratings 
historically  advertisers have spent more on advertising through traditional broadcast television than through pay television 
we believe that as pay television continues to gain viewership relative to broadcast television  it should attract a larger percentage of the total available dollars spent on television advertising 
also  as pay television draws audience share from broadcast television  audience demographics become fragmented  and  as a result  advertisers are able to target groups of viewers with specific demographic profiles 
since february  paid commercial programming  infomercials  has been carried on our domestic channel and  prior to the sale of our international business  on a limited basis in several international regional feeds of our international channel 
ratings among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market  the hallmark channel ranked th in total day with a household rating for the year and th for prime time with a household rating for the year  according to nielsen media research 
in among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market  the hallmark channel ranked th in total day with a household rating for the year and nd for prime time with a household rating for the year  according to nielsen media research 
total day means the time period measured from the time each day the broadcast of commercially sponsored programming commences to the time such commercially sponsored programming ends 
we believe that the key demographics for the hallmark channel are the viewers in the groups adults and women internationally  during the international hallmark channel ranked in the top five cable and satellite channels in the uk according to the broadcaster audience research board 
in the uk  the channel enjoyed a strong and sustained increase in ratings over the past two years  increasing its television rating among adults in multi channel homes by from and its share  or percentage of viewing audience  among individuals in multi channel homes by 
the channel was the th most watched commercial non terrestrial channel in poland according to agb polska in december the channel ranked among the top ten multi channel networks in hungary according to agb hungary for the year 
licensing revenue program suppliers sell or license programming to broadcasters and video distributors pay television channel providers who pay a license fee for the right to exploit air the programming over a certain period in their program package 
our licensing of film assets is an important contributor to our revenues and  because the amortization of our film assets is a non cash expense  also to our cash flow 
channels the hallmark channel united states programming our domestic channel offers a range of high quality  entertainment programming for adults and families including movies  miniseries  epics  historical dramas  romances  literary classics  and contemporary stories 
sources for programming on our domestic channel include the crown media library  programming licensed from hallmark entertainment distribution  and programming licensed from third parties 
prior to the purchase of the crown media library  we licensed substantially all of the titles in that library from hallmark entertainment distribution 
examples of programming from our library and the hallmark entertainment library include  larry mcmurtry s lonesome dove  th kingdom  neil simon s london suite  gulliver s travels  dog of the yukon call of the wild and larry mcmurtry s dead man s walk as well as programming previously shown as hallmark hall of fame such as william faulkner s old man  rose hill  sarah plain and tall and what the deaf man heard 
we benefit from these original hallmark entertainment productions  which are sometimes premiered and often aired on our domestic channel 
examples of third party programming shown on our domestic channel include the popular drama series m a s h  judging amy  magnum  pi  matlock  touched by an angel  walker texas ranger  rawhide  dr 
quinn medicine woman  and perry mason 
other examples of our third party programming include acquired movies and miniseries such as roots  north and south  the thorn birds and shogun 
our license agreements with third parties typically provide for a license fee paid out over the term of the license for the right to exhibit a program in the united states within a specified period of time 
distribution our domestic channel ended with million subscribers  an increase of from million at the year end 
we currently distribute our domestic channel to approximately of all united states pay television subscribers

we charge our pay television distributors a monthly per subscriber fee for the right to broadcast our domestic channel 
generally  these distribution agreements last from five to ten years  and sometimes include annual increases of both subscribers and per subscriber fees 
a distribution agreement may also involve a payment by us for the establishment of the relationship or  together with or in lieu of any payment  the free carriage of our channel to subscribers for a period of time and discounts or no fees if certain subscriber levels are achieved

sales and marketing our primary target demographics are women aged to and adults aged to and our secondary target is adults aged to our programming is targeted to adults  but is generally appropriate for viewing by the entire family  which is important to viewers  advertisers and affiliates alike

much of the hallmark channel s unique programming comes from hallmark entertainment  including merlin  alice in wonderland and dinotopia 
hallmark entertainment original productions rank among the highest rated programs on us broadcast network television 
the power of the hallmark brand and the quality of hallmark entertainment combine to provide our viewers with tangible evidence of our commitment to the best in entertainment for the entire family  enhance our ability to attract advertising commitments and higher cost per thousands cpm from the largest advertisers  and provide a competitive advantage in negotiating long term distribution agreements with pay television distributors 
hallmark movie channel in  we launched our second domestic channel  the hallmark movie channel  which is distributed on digital tiers or as part of packages of services 
the movie channel features top rated movies from over  hours of programming in the crown media library 
in addition  the movie channel showcases movies previously shown as hallmark hall of fame and also features movies from sources other than hallmark and the crown media library 
the hallmark channel international as disclosed in this report  we sold our international business to a third party on april  the following is a description of our international business conducted prior to such sale

programming the international channel offered a range of award winning programming including made for television movies  miniseries  epics  historical dramas and series 
we sought programming that was consistent with our programming theme great stories that stay with you 
the high quality  entertainment programming for adults and families that we offered was based on universal themes  included world renowned actors and actresses  such as sidney poitier  whoopi goldberg  anjelica huston  and james earl jones and was often filmed in international locations 
significant sources for our programming were the crown media library and programming by hallmark entertainment  inc hallmark entertainment  which was available to us through our program agreements 
prior to the purchase of the crown media library  we licensed substantially all of the titles in that library from hallmark entertainment distribution 
we enjoyed access to new hallmark entertainment programming through an amended five year program license agreement with hallmark entertainment distribution 
for more information regarding the program license agreements with hallmark entertainment distribution  please see part iii below 
hallmark entertainment provided family programming for audiences worldwide  generally delivering more than forty projects each year 
we licensed for that same time period the remaining portion of the international channel s programming line up from third parties 
this third party programming was consistent with the themes and quality of the material we own or license from hallmark entertainment distribution 
we licensed programming from third party suppliers such as cbs broadcast international  southern star sales limited  granada international  paramount television  minotaur entertainment  nbc universal inc  metro goldwyn mayer studios inc  columbia tri star international  sony pictures  aba plus and warner bros

we also aired third party movies and mini series including the fourth protocol  on golden pond  and hawking 
distribution in the countries where we offered the international channel  we distributed the channel through a variety of distribution platforms  including cable  satellite broadcast systems  digital terrestrial television and satellite master antenna television 
we distributed the channel through distribution agreements with local pay television operators such as bskyb  canal digital  home entertainment  measat  multichoice  pctv and sky italy 
our distribution agreements with such operators generally lasted from two to five years 
we had the capability to create and deliver our channel to new platforms in a short period of time through our broadcast infrastructure based in greenwood village  colorado 
we had a strategic relationship with pramer  sca  which performed all day to day operations including program acquisitions  scheduling  marketing  advertising and affiliate sales  playback and uplink for our operations in mexico  central and south america 
we regularly reviewed existing and potential markets to assess their prospects 
as the number of international channel subscribers increased in a market  we assessed our ability to increase revenue or develop new revenue sources by subdividing the market through the addition of satellite signals to individual countries within that market as opportunities particularly advertising arose 
when we subdivided a market  we were able to customize the channel to appeal to a more specific audience 
the delivery of the international channel to more targeted audiences also increased the number of potential advertisers on the channel by creating more targeted advertising opportunities for local or regional businesses in the markets in which we operate

the network operations center  which enabled us to control delivery of our channels to our pay television distributors  allowed us to insert commercials into our programming from a central point 
the company had international sales offices in buenos aires  hong kong  london  mumbai  sydney and taipei 
sales and marketing our international channel focused its marketing efforts on maximizing our two revenue streams  distribution and advertising sales  in the individual markets in which the channel was distributed 
our international channel s marketing efforts varied by market depending on the maturity of the local television industry  the level of distribution of our channel and the potential for the sale of advertising 
in markets where our international channel is not carried by all the pay television distributors  marketing efforts were primarily directed toward potential new distributors 
these efforts included advertising in trade publications and participating in industry trade shows as well as direct mail and public relations campaigns 
in these markets  efforts were also made to market the channel to potential viewers to drive consumer demand for carriage of the channel by local affiliates 
in markets where our international channel has obtained substantial distribution or has exclusive agreements with primary distributors  marketing efforts were primarily directed toward maintaining subscribers and viewership 
our efforts in these markets were primarily directed toward a target of adults to these efforts often included traditional marketing campaigns consisting of on air promotion  print  billboard  cross channels  radio and television advertising and sometimes these efforts were partially funded by our pay television distributors in each market 
additionally  we emphasized our unique relationship with our primary content supplier  hallmark entertainment distribution  through the use of premier screening events  press tours with actors and actresses and viewer trips to movie sets 
we also used our website to market and promote the channel to consumers through schedule information  movie synopses  games and contests all of which are localized across the region 
this was in addition to a comprehensive business to business website for our external customers such as journalists  affiliates and local agents 
in markets where we were developing our international channel s advertising business  marketing efforts were also directed toward potential advertisers 
when marketing the hallmark channel to potential advertisers  we used local representation to target media planners and buyers and international advertisers 
channel operations the programming department  and  prior to the international sale  programming departments at each of our regional offices or partners have been responsible for ensuring the consistent quality of the programming we offer 
the programming  scheduling and acquisitions departments work in conjunction with the traffic department and creative services to create the distinctive appearance of our channel 
some of these functions are outsourced on an as needed basis 
the creation of our channel begins with the acquisition of programming 
subsequent to the sale of the international business  we have approximately titles in the crown media library 
in addition  we license programming from hallmark entertainment distribution and other program suppliers 
our staff or third parties review and summarize all potential programming to ensure compliance with our quality and content standards 
prior to the international sale  the acquisitions staff in our regional offices licensed programming based on the amount of new programming required on the channels 
each of the acquisitions offices worked together to leverage multi channel acquisitions across many territories to reduce license fees  but remain sensitive to specific markets with targeted localized programming 
in most of our international markets  we customized the hallmark channel by dubbing or subtitling program elements into local languages 
the decision to customize the channel into local languages was based on local market practices  viewer preferences and cost considerations 
language preparation was coordinated in the regional offices in london and hong kong and by pramer in buenos aires 
program language elements were typically shipped to the specific region to ensure that nuances in dialect of the particular language are captured 
the language versions were then combined with the other programming elements 
the creation of on air promotional segments interstitials  which are broadcast between the feature movies  miniseries and series  are typically outsourced to external vendors 
promotional segments were prepared in many languages for broadcast worldwide 
these interstitials are intended to invite viewership  guide viewers to specific programming  and promote brand awareness for the hallmark channel 
the scheduling department creates the play list  which contains a list of daily programming 
the scheduling department works with marketing personnel to continuously monitor the programming mix 
the play list is then forwarded to the traffic department 
the traffic department inserts promotional segments and advertising into the play list and creates the daily log  which contains a detailed schedule of the stream of programming  commercials and promotional materials that will ultimately be viewed by the subscriber for each regional feed of the hallmark channel 
the daily log  together with digital tapes that contain the corresponding programming  are then forwarded to either the network operations center or  to the third party facility  which is performing the playback and uplink services for the feed 
digital tapes that contain the promotional segments are forwarded to either the network operations center or to the third party origination and playback facility separately 
channel delivery we deliver the daily log and digital tapes to the network operations center described below or to a third party origination and playback facility for each market  where the programming  promotional and advertising elements are combined and compressed into a single signal  and transported to an uplink facility 
the uplink facility then transmits the signal to the satellite transponder that covers the relevant geographic market  and the transponder reflects the signal back within its designated geographic area to head end facilities and direct to home satellite services operated by pay television distributors who receive and decode our signal and transmit our channel 
prior to the international sale  we owned and operated the global network operations center  which consists of  square feet at greenwood village  colorado  which commenced operations in february and has the ability to perform origination and playback services for up to programming channels 
the network operations center is an efficient  state of the art broadcasting operation 
the broadcast facility was included in the sale of our international business  and we continue to use the facility under a technical services agreement

we are also using the films as programming for our television channels and interactive uses 
crown media distribution oversees sales and distribution of the crown media library to third party licensees 
third party licensees purchase available rights  which primarily include all forms of television and home video 
crown media distribution has a service agreement with hallmark entertainment  providing for services relating to the administration  distribution and other exploitation of the crown media library  and directs the hallmark entertainment sales force worldwide in all sales matters pertaining to the crown media library 
competition the pay television industry is highly competitive 
our channels have competed for distribution  viewers and advertisers with other pay television channels  broadcast television channels and with other general forms of entertainment 
there are several sources of competition within our industry  each of which affects our business strategy 
our domestic channel competes with other general entertainment programming from tnt  usa network  a e  the discovery channel  lifetime  abc family and other similarly targeted channels 
our international channel competed with general entertainment programming from axn  i sat  canal fox  tnt  uk gold and usa network 
we compete with these channels for viewers and advertising dollars based upon quality of programming  number of subscribers  ratings and subscriber demographics 
we compete with all channels for carriage on cable and satellite systems that may have limited capacity 
competition continues to intensify as the industry shifts from analog distribution to digital distribution 
many pay television distributors have upgraded their physical infrastructures to accommodate digital delivery  which provides significantly more channel capacity 
we believe that it will take several years for the majority of current subscribers to convert to  and begin paying for  upgraded services 
in an effort to accelerate the conversion  pay television distributors are attempting to place new channels on their digital tier as opposed to their limited  yet more widely distributed  analog tiers 
although competition for the remaining widely distributed analog channel space is still intense  as more and more subscribers are converted  the digital tier is expected to become the dominant platform 
competitive strengths we have established a track record of providing high quality programming 
we believe that our primary competitive strengths include the following pay television channel branded with the well known hallmark name our channel is branded with the hallmark name 
we believe that viewers and distributors associate the hallmark brand with family values and high quality content and that our association with this brand facilitates our efforts to achieve increased distribution and to attract additional viewers that leads to higher ratings and advertising revenue 
long term distribution contracts that call for increasing subscriber counts and fees at december   we had long term distribution agreements with adelphia  cablevision  charter  comcast  cox  directv  echostar  and time warner in the united states  as well as a number of other distributors 
the terms of our major distribution agreements generally provide for subscriber increases over time  although some provide for lower or no subscriber fees if certain levels of subscribers are achieved 
a library of popular and award winning programming and guaranteed access through long term agreements to other similar programming our library gives us control over a significant amount of popular and award winning programming that we can either air on our channel or license in the united states to third parties 
these titles provide us with a portion of our core programming  and by owning these titles  we have the flexibility to use them as needed to create the most effective program schedules 
owning these titles also eliminates the license fees we otherwise would have to pay for these titles and provides a revenue stream for us from licensing the titles to third parties 
we have a five year program agreement with hallmark entertainment ending december   that provides us with access to new quality productions  as well as to the titles in the hallmark entertainment distribution library that we did not purchase 
this program agreement will be automatically extended for an addition three year term if at that time hallmark entertainment distribution s parent company  hallmark entertainment llc  owns at least of the company 
experienced management members of our senior management team have experience launching  promoting and operating channels both domestically and internationally 
they have held senior positions at such companies as the discovery channel  cable satellite public affairs network  the news corporation  telecommunications international  inc  abc  cbs sports  turner network television  mediaone international  the golf channel and usa networks 
competitive risks one channel distributed domestically we operate one primary channel in the united states 
many competitors have more than one channel and may also be diversified entertainment companies  giving them an advantage in dealing with distributors and advertisers 
these companies are also able to leverage costs across multiple channels 
entertainment programming our programming is entertainment designed for adults and families and is intended to meet quality standards that are associated with the hallmark trademark 
competitors may have more flexibility in programming 
ratings which affect advertising our ratings have improved substantially over the last two years 
nevertheless  our competitors include channels with more subscribers and higher ratings  which affects rates that we can charge for advertising 
research the research departments at the company provide strategic and tactical guidance to decision makers within the company  as well as supplying information about the channel to potential advertisers and affiliates 
these departments provide data on the size and demographics of our audience and information about our audiences  competitors  markets and industry 
currently  our channel s research department translates our overall business strategy into a cohesive research program 
this information assists our executives to more effectively target  brand  promote  program  and better understand where opportunities lie  in order to increase our channel s market share 
the research department has sophisticated ratings systems npower  pnf and adviews and competitive tracking database hardware and software 
trends and changes from these ratings systems are reported to top management for short and long term strategic planning 
our channel s performance is tracked through an internal tracking study established in july  which is a monthly telephone survey conducted among a national probability sample of approximately  adults 
the research department also subscribes to a number of other services  which are useful in obtaining information about viewers of our channel 
employees we had and employees at december  and  respectively 
subsequent to the sale of our international business in april  we had employees 
neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
substantially all of our domestic channel s employees work at our offices in studio city  california and new york  new york 
regulation the operations of television channels in the united states are regulated 
within the united states  program access rules applicable to channel providers with ownership ties to pay television distributors may limit business combinations between these two types of companies 
financial information about geographic areas information concerning revenue and long lived assets attributable to external customers  domestically and internationally  may be found in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
risk factors and forward looking statements the discussion set forth in this form k contains statements concerning potential future events 
such forward looking statements are based on assumptions by crown media holdings management  as of the date of this form k including assumptions about risks and uncertainties faced by crown media holdings 
readers can identify these forward looking statements by their use of such verbs as expects  anticipates  believes  or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs 
if any of management s assumptions prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise  crown media holdings actual results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements could materially differ from those anticipated by such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are those discussed below in this form k 
crown media holdings will not update any forward looking statements contained in this form k to reflect future events or developments 
if we do not successfully address the risks described below  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
the trading price of our class a common stock could decline because of any of these risks 
risks relating to our business our business has incurred net losses since inception and may continue to incur losses 
both our international and domestic channels have a history of net losses and we expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  total stockholders equity of approximately million  goodwill of approximately million  and film assets of million 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability 
if we are not able to achieve or sustain profitability  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall significantly 
to diminish our losses and become profitable  we will need to substantially increase our revenue  particularly advertising and licensing revenue 
this will require  among other things  increasing the distribution of our channels  attracting more viewers to our channels  attracting more advertisers  and increasing our advertising rates 
risks associated with these areas of our business are described below 
in addition  in order to accomplish these goals  the management of crown media holdings continues to believe that it is necessary to increase subscribers and enhance our programming  which results in increased subscriber acquisition fees and higher costs for programming 
over the last four years  these actions have contributed to increased net losses for crown media holdings 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health  and the restrictions imposed by the terms of our debt instruments may severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   our total debt was million and we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  as of march   we could borrow the remaining million available borrowing under our bank credit facility to cover the negative cash flow resulting from our current operations 
subject to restrictions under our debt agreements  we may also seek equity or debt financing from time to time to cover our operating losses  to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures or for other purposes 
as a result of our level of debt and the terms of our debt instruments our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions is heightened  we will be required to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  we are and will continue to be limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in our ability to borrow additional funds  consummate asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates or conduct mergers and acquisitions  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry will be limited  we are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates  and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 
our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performances and on economic  financial  competitive and other factors 
there can be no assurance that our leverage and such restrictions will not materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
we have increasing interest expense  which may impact our future operations 
high levels of interest expense could have negative effects on our future operations 
interest expense  which is net of interest income and includes amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense on borrowings under our senior and demand notes and bank credit facility  increased substantially over the past year 
the increase in interest expense in the past twelve months resulted from an increase in the average borrowings outstanding  due to cash generated from operations being insufficient to cover operating expenses and capital expenditures 
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be used to pay our interest expense and will not be available for other business purposes 
in addition  we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future financings will be available to provide sufficient proceeds to meet our obligations or to service our total debt 
our liquidity is dependent on external funds 
because we currently operate at a loss and may have a negative cash flow  any unanticipated significant expense or any development that hampers our growth in revenue or decreases any of our revenue  would result in the need for additional external funds in order to continue operations 
we have no arrangements for any external financings  whether debt or equity  and are not certain whether any such new external financing would be available on acceptable terms 
any new debt financing would require the cooperation and agreement of existing lenders 
modification of any existing agreements with united states distributors could result in an increased obligation to pay subscriber acquisition fees 
several of the crown media united states existing distribution agreements contain most favored nations clauses 
these clauses typically provide that  in the event crown media united states enters into an agreement with another distributor on more favorable terms  these terms must be offered to the existing distributor  subject to certain exceptions and conditions 
distribution agreements which we may enter into in the future may also contain similar most favored nation clauses 
in the past  crown media united states was asked to comply with such clauses and modify its distribution agreements with certain distributors after entering into new distribution agreements 
any claims under these clauses in the future could result in the payment of cash or the issuance of stock by us to our distributors and would negatively affect subscriber revenues  however  if our subscription base is increased as a result of such modification  it could result in higher advertising revenue 
if we are unable to obtain programming from third parties  we may be unable to increase our subscriber base 
we compete with other pay television channel providers to acquire programming 
if we fail to continue to obtain programming on reasonable terms for any reason  including as a result of competition  we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming  which may hinder the growth of our subscriber base 
if our programming declines in popularity  our subscriber fees and advertising revenue could fall and the additional revenue we expect as a result of the acquisition of film assets from hallmark entertainment distribution may be lower than we anticipate 
our success depends partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
we may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in our markets 
in particular  our ability to react effectively may be limited by our obligation to license programming from hallmark entertainment distribution  which has standards and contractual commitments to other parties that limit the types of programming that it will provide to us 
our competitors may have more flexible programming arrangements  as well as greater amounts of production  better distribution  and greater capital resources  and may be able to react more quickly to shifts in tastes and interests 
as a result  we may be unable to maintain the commercial success of any of our current programming  or to generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for our new programming 
a shift in viewer preferences in programming or alternative entertainment activities could also reduce the amount of revenue we anticipate receiving from licensing of our film assets and cause a decline in both advertising and subscriber fees revenue 
the decline in revenue could hinder or prevent us from achieving profitability and could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
we are currently dependent on hallmark entertainment to distribute and maximize licensing fees from the film assets 
currently  we are dependent on hallmark entertainment  a related party  to distribute and license our film assets to third parties for us under a services agreement  which will expire on december  this arrangement reduces our control over the sales and distribution of the film assets and might delay our realization of the full revenue stream from the film assets 
we and hallmark entertainment each have the right to terminate the service agreement on a yearly basis 
if hallmark entertainment elects to terminate the agreement before we have established our own distribution network  we may not be able to establish our own or obtain alternative distribution services of equivalent quality or on terms as favorable to us 
termination of this services agreement could hinder our ability  at least in the short term  to achieve the amount of additional revenue anticipated from these activities and could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
we may in due course develop our own distribution sales network and hire employees to perform the services currently performed by hallmark entertainment under the service agreement 
our ability to do so is unproven and will require financial  operational and management resources 
we may not be able to hire the number of employees  or employees who are sufficiently qualified  to perform these services  or do so in a cost efficient manner 
if the cost to develop and maintain this employee base is greater  or if this process takes longer than anticipated  it could have a negative impact on the revenue we anticipate generating from the film assets 
if we are unable to increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve profitability 
although it is expected over time that our advertising revenue will increase  if we fail to increase significantly our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability or to expand our business 
a failure to increase advertising revenue may be a result of any or all of the following i we have a limited history of marketing and selling advertising time  ii we may be unable to identify  attract and retain experienced sales and marketing personnel with relevant experience for our us channel  iii our sales and marketing organization may be unable to successfully compete against the significantly more extensive and well funded sales and marketing operations of our current or potential competitors  iv the advancement of technologies such as digital video recording may cause industry wide changes concerning the frequency in which individuals are exposed to advertising on television  and or v we will not be able to increase our advertising sales rate card or may be required to run additional advertising spots which affect the availability of advertising inventory for future sales 
success in increasing our advertising revenue also depends upon the number and coverage of the distributors who carry our channels  our number of subscribers  and the viewership ratings for our programming 
hallmark entertainment investments controls us and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control 
hallmark entertainment investments controls all of our outstanding shares of class b common stock and owns shares of our class a common stock  representing in the aggregate approximately of the outstanding voting power on all matters submitted to our stockholders 
hallmark entertainment holdings  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  controls the voting of all our shares held by hallmark entertainment investments 
hallmark entertainment investments control could discourage others from initiating potential merger  takeover or other change of control transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or holders of class a common stock 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could suffer  and our business could suffer 
hallmark entertainment investments control relationship with us also could give rise to conflicts of interest in certain situations 
hallmark entertainment distribution may not deliver to us as many programs as it has historically delivered 
we currently acquire library programming  new productions and first run presentations pursuant to our program license agreement with hallmark entertainment distribution 
however  hallmark entertainment distribution is not required to deliver a specific minimum number of programs 
we could be forced to develop and produce or acquire alternative programming if we no longer receive as many programs from hallmark entertainment distribution as we have in prior years and  without adequate notice  this could negatively impact our ability to effectively program our channel 
we could lose the right to use the name hallmark because we have limited duration trademark license agreements  which could harm our business 
we license the name hallmark from hallmark licensing  inc  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  for various uses  including the name of our domestic channel 
this license will expire on september  if hallmark cards determines not to renew the trademark license agreements for any reason  including our failure to meet minimum programming thresholds dependent on programming provided by affiliates of hallmark cards or to comply with hallmark cards programming standards  we would be forced to significantly revise our business plan and operations  and could experience a significant erosion of our subscriber base and advertising revenue  particularly in the united states 
if our third party suppliers fail to provide us with network infrastructure services on a timely basis  our costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
we currently rely on third parties to supply key network infrastructure services  including uplink  playback  transmission and satellite services to certain of our markets  which are available only from limited sources 
we have occasionally experienced delays and other problems in receiving communications equipment  services and facilities and may  in the future  be unable to obtain such services  equipment or facilities on the scale and within the time frames required by us on terms we find acceptable  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain  or if we experience a delay in the delivery of  such services  we may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative third party suppliers or adjust our operations  which could hinder our growth and reduce our revenue and potential profitability 
if the network operations center fails  or its operations are disrupted  our costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
we are currently using the network operations center for the origination and playback of signals for the hallmark channel 
like other single point facilities  the network operations center is subject to interruption from fire  tornadoes  lightning and other unexpected natural causes 
although there are redundant systems in place  equipment failure  employee misconduct or outside interference could also disrupt the network operations center s services 
we currently have certain backup facilities for the domestic channel 
any significant interruption at the network operations center affecting the distribution of our channel could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
as part of the sale of the international business  the buyer of the business acquired the network operations center  but we continue to use the network operations center for the distribution of our domestic channel pursuant to a service agreement  and we depend upon the buyer in providing these services for our domestic channel 
any significant interruption of such services affecting the distribution of our channels could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to retain key executives and other personnel  our growth could be inhibited and our business harmed 
our success depends on the expertise and continued service of our executive officers and key employees of our subsidiaries 
if we fail to attract  hire or retain the necessary personnel  or if we lose the services of our key executives  we may be unable to implement our business plan or keep pace with developing trends in our industry 
the amount of our goodwill  as well as our film costs  may hinder our ability to achieve profitability 
as a result of our acquisitions of all the common interests in crown media united states  we have generated a significant amount of goodwill 
we ceased the amortization of this acquired goodwill  and we are required to periodically review whether the value of our goodwill has been impaired 
if we are required to write down our goodwill  our results of operations  stockholders equity could be materially adversely affected 
we also have film costs relating to the amortization of the purchase price for the film assets that we use and license to others 
these film costs are  and will continue to be  a significant component of our cost of services each quarter 
our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many factors may cause the market price for our class a common stock to decline  including our operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  technological innovations by competitors or competing technologies  investor perceptions of our industry or prospects  or those of our customers  and changes in general market conditions or economic trends 
additionally  of the approximately million shares of the company s outstanding class a common stock  only million shares approximately are not held by affiliates of the company 
this stock ownership structure may also be a cause of volatility in the market price of the company s class a common stock 
risks relating to our industry the proposed change in television ratings in the united states could reduce our channel revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
our domestic advertising revenues are partially dependent on television ratings provided by nielsen media research 
nielsen is currently modifying its ratings system by increasing its household sample size and plans to institute other changes in its audience measurement systems 
our ratings could either be positively or negatively affected by these changes  depending on the demographic characteristics of the households added to the nielsen sample and the natures of the changes in the measurement systems 
competition could reduce our channel revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
we operate in the pay television business  which is highly competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with large diversified entertainment companies that have substantially greater resources than we have  our operating margins and market share could be reduced  and the growth of our business inhibited 
in particular  we compete for distribution with other pay television channels and  when distribution is obtained  for viewers and advertisers with pay television channels  broadcast television networks  radio  the internet and other media 
we also compete  to varying degrees  with other leisure time activities such as movie theaters  the internet  radio  print media  electronic games and other alternative sources of entertainment and information 
future technological developments may affect competition within this business 
a continuing trend towards business combinations and alliances in the communications industries may create significant new competitors for us or intensify existing competition 
many of these combined entities have more than one channel and resources far greater than ours 
these combined entities may provide bundled packages of programming  delivery and other services that compete directly with the products we offer 
we may need to reduce our prices or license additional programming to remain competitive  and we may be unable to sustain future pricing levels as competition increases 
our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our programming at desired pricing levels could impair our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow  which would harm our business 
distributors in the united states may attempt to pressure pay tv channels with lower viewership  such as our channel  to accept decreasing amounts for subscriber fees  to pay higher subscriber acquisition fees or to allow carriage of the channel without the payment of subscriber fees 
factors that may lead to this pressure include the number of competing pay tv channels  the limited space available on services of distributors in the united states and the desire of distributors to maintain or reduce costs 
any reduction in subscriber fees revenue now or in the future could have a material impact on our ability to achieve profitability and cash flow 
new distribution technologies may fundamentally change the way we distribute our channels and could significantly decrease our revenue or require us to incur significant capital expenditures 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer  on a timely basis  services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the pay television industry has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to rapid and significant technological change  including continuing developments in technology which do not presently have widely accepted standards  and frequent introductions of new services and alternative technologies  including new technologies for providing video services 
for example  the advent of digital technology is likely to accelerate the convergence of broadcast  telecommunications  internet and other media and could result in material changes in the economics  regulations  intellectual property usage and technical platforms on which our business relies  including lower retail rates for video services 
these changes could fundamentally affect the scale  source  and volatility of our revenue streams  cost structures  and profitability  and may require us to significantly change our operations 
we also rely in part on third parties for the development of  and access to  communications and network technology 
as a result  we may be unable to obtain access to new technology on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  which could harm our business and prospects 
moreover  the increased capacity of digital distribution platforms  including the introduction of digital terrestrial television  may reduce the competition for the right to carry channels and allow development of extra services at low incremental cost 
these lower incremental costs could lower barriers to entry for competing channels  and place pressure on our operating margins and market position 
in addition  a greater number of channels would likely increase competition among channels for viewers and advertisers  which could affect our ability to attract advertising and new distribution at desired pricing levels  and could therefore hinder or prevent the growth of our subscriber base 
if we fail to comply with applicable government regulations  our business could be harmed 
if  as a provider of television channels  we fail to comply with applicable present or future government regulations in the us  we could be prohibited from operating in the us and could be subject to monetary fines  either of which would increase our operating costs  reduce our revenue and limit our ability to achieve profitability 
moreover  broadcasting regulations are generally subject to periodic and on going governmental review and legislative initiatives  which may  in the future  affect the nature of programming we are able to offer and the means by which it is distributed 
the timing  scope or outcome of these reviews could be unfavorable to us  and any changes to current broadcasting legislation or regulations could require adjustments to our operations 
the federal communications commission or congress may enact requirements that cable program services be offered to subscribers on an a la carte basis  ie be made available for purchase separately and not as part of a package of services 
such requirements could result in a reduction in the total number of subscribers to our domestic program services and adversely affect advertising revenue

the company will continue to strive to expand its domestic subscriber base  and to increase its domestic ratings because growth of these two factors are necessary in order to increase subscriber demand for the company s channel and its advertising revenues 
in addition  our management believes that advertisers will generally spend more advertising dollars on more fully distributed networks 
one of our challenges is to expand our distribution in the united states in a cost effective manner 
when subscribers are added under distribution agreements  we are typically asked to pay subscriber acquisition fees and support payments for the launch of the channel 
increases in our ratings  our programming line up and our relationship with hallmark cards can be favorable factors in our negotiation of these payments 
one disadvantage is that we have one channel while many of our competitors operate multiple channels and thus have more leverage in dealing with distributors 
the company plans to continue its current programming strategy in order to increase its ratings 
building on the success that the domestic channel experienced during the holiday season  we have an aggressive original movie schedule in  which will include more than original movies 
additionally  the company will design marketing campaigns around these original movies  as well as certain holidays such as mother s day and christmas  and build on our relationship with hallmark cards 
the company will continue to monitor its operating expenses to identify areas where greater efficiencies can be attained to reduce our operating expenses relative to our revenue streams  and  if needed  reduce these expenses during the year to manage its cash needs 
in addition  we also plan on refinancing our bank credit facility in to provide for our future cash requirements 
the primary financial and non financial measures analyzed by management are adjusted ebitda as defined below and the metrics driving each of our revenue lines such as subscriber counts  advertising rates  domestic ratings  and demographics of our viewing audiences 
international business on february   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of our international business to a group of investors comprised of providence equity partners  i and uk television executive david elstein investor group 
this transaction closed on april  the sale included the international versions of the hallmark channel distributed outside the united states  the international rights to over titles in the crown media library  and the network operations center based in denver  colorado 
substantially all of the employees of the international business as well as the broadcast facility are employed by the investor group 
other than in respect of or as contemplated by the agreement for these transactions  there are no material relationships between us and our affiliates  on the one hand  and the buyer and its affiliates  on the other hand 
the sale price for the transaction was million  subject to purchase price adjustments relating to receivables acquired and working capital changes 
for information regarding net cash proceeds from the sale  the obligation to pay certain liabilities of the international business  adjustments made to the purchase price  the use of net proceeds from the sale of the international business and accounting treatment for the that sale  see sale of international business in note of notes to consolidated financial statements below 
the above purchase price and related estimated fair values were used in the company s evaluations of impairment as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the purchase agreement provided for the sale of the outstanding capital stock of the two operating subsidiaries of the company s international business  crown media international  llc and crown entertainment limited  for million  subject to a purchase price adjustment for certain working capital changes 
an asset purchase agreement provided for the sale of certain international rights to a library of theatrical films  made for television movies  specials  mini series  series and other television programming for million  subject to purchase price adjustments relating to receivables acquired and working capital changes 
the agreements also contain customary representations and warranties of the parties  indemnification and termination provisions 
the purchase agreement and asset purchase agreement are exhibits and  respectively  to this report 
the description of these agreements contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreements 
cash flow our cash flows will be affected by the sale of our international operations and international film rights 
the generation of positive cash flows in years beyond are expected to be dependent upon increasing our advertising revenues and continuing to focus on cost management 
significant uses of cash during the year ended december   were for program acquisitions in primarily our domestic and united kingdom markets 
the company also paid subscriber acquisition fees resulting from distribution agreements renegotiated in the past years 
attainment of certain subscriber levels will also cause an increase in subscriber acquisition fee payments in future years  but as many of our more significant distribution agreements expire in  we do not foresee significant subscriber acquisition fee payments after impairment of assets please see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report for information on impairment charges for relating primarily to our international assets 
revenue our revenue consists of primarily subscriber fees  advertising and film asset license fees 
subscriber fees subscriber fees are generally payable to us on a per subscriber basis by pay television distributors for the right to carry our channels 
in the united states  we pay certain television distributors up front subscriber acquisition fees to carry our channel 
however  such payments have not been common in the international cable television markets 
subscriber acquisition fees that we pay are capitalized and amortized over the contractual term of the applicable distribution agreement as a reduction in subscriber fee revenue 
if the amortization expense exceeds the revenue recognized on a per distributor basis  the excess amortization is included as a component of cost of services 
at the time we sign a distribution agreement  we evaluate the recoverability of the costs we incur against the incremental revenue directly and indirectly associated with each agreement 
rates we receive per subscriber vary according to the level of sophistication and degree of competition in the market  the relative position in the market of the distributor and the popularity of the channel  the packaging arrangements for the channel  and other commercial terms and length of the contract term 
in some circumstances  international distributors provided minimum revenue guarantees 
we are in continuous negotiations with both our existing distributors and new distributors to increase our subscriber base in order to enhance our advertising results 
in the united states  we are often subject to requests by distributors to pay subscriber acquisition fees for additional subscribers or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided 
we also may help fund the distributors efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees 
as we continue our efforts to add subscribers  our domestic subscriber revenue will continue to be negatively affected by subscriber acquisition fee amortization  waiver of subscriber fees and bulk discounts resulting from the attainment of certain subscriber levels  however  we believe that as a result of these measures  our subscriber counts will increase which in turn will allow us to attract additional advertisers and command higher advertising rates 
the company discontinued distribution of the channel in spain effective march   since a new agreement was not reached with its primary distributor in spain 
the company also discontinued distribution of the channel in portugal effective march   since it was no longer costs effective for the company to distribute the channel in portugal with the discontinuance of operations in spain 
our channel is usually offered as one of a number of channels on either a basic tier or part of other program packages and is not generally offered on a stand alone basis 
thus  while a cable or satellite customer may subscribe and unsubscribe to the tiers and program packages in which our channel is placed  these customers do not subscribe and unsubscribe to our channel alone 
we are not provided with information from the distributors on their overall subscriber churn and in what manner their churn rates affect our subscriber counts  instead we are provided information on the total number of subscribers who receive the hallmark channel 
our subscriber count depends on the number of distributors carrying the hallmark channel and the size of such distributors as well as the program tiers on which our channel is carried by these distributors 
from time to time  we experience decreases in the number of subscribers as promotional periods end  or as a distributor arrangement is amended or terminated by us or the distributor 
changes to distribution arrangements in have not been significant 
management analyzes the estimated effect each new or amended distribution agreement will have on revenues and costs 
based upon these analyses  management endeavors to achieve a fair combination of subscriber commitments and subscriber acquisition fees with each of our domestic distributors 
advertising advertising sales generally are made on the basis of a price per advertising spot or per unit of audience measurement for example  a ratings point 
thus  our advertising revenues are heavily dependent on third parties ratings of the persons viewing our channel 
prices vary on a market by market basis 
rates differ among markets depending on audience demographics 
in the us where regular audience measurements are available  our advertising rates are generally calculated on the basis of an agreed upon price per unit of audience measurement in return for a guaranteed commitment by the advertiser 
we commit to provide advertisers certain rating levels in connection with their advertising 
revenue is recorded net of estimated delivery shortfalls  which are usually settled by providing the advertiser additional advertising time 
advertising rates also vary by time of year due to seasonal changes in television viewership 
film licensing crown media distribution generates revenue from the film assets by granting licenses to exhibit the films to third parties 
we are also using the films as programming for our channel 
customers for our film assets consist of other television channels and home video distributors who resell rights to our film assets 
license fees for our film assets are generally negotiated based upon the size of the potential audience who will be viewing the programming 
cost of services our cost of services consists primarily of program license fees  amortization of our film assets  subscriber acquisition fee expense  the cost of signal distribution  prior to the international sale  dubbing and subtitling programming for foreign audiences  administration  distribution and other exploitation of our film assets  and the cost of promotional segments that are aired between programs 
we expect cost of services to continue to increase in the future as we expand our existing markets and third party programming to support our advertising strategy 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires crown media holdings to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
for further information regarding our critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates  please see the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following discussion concerns certain accounting estimates and assumptions that are considered to be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for uncertain matters and the susceptibility of such matters to changes 
revenue recognition advertising revenues are recognized as earned in the period in which the advertising is telecast and are generally billed monthly 
revenue is recognized as commercial spots or long form programming are aired and as ratings guarantees to advertisers are achieved 
advertising revenue and expenses in barter transactions are recorded at the fair value of the advertising to be provided 
in certain markets  delivery of advertising is determined based upon data received from third parties who measure the ratings of our channels 
the ratings information drives our calculations of impressions delivered which in turn drives the amount of revenue we recognize from each advertising spot 
our advertising revenue is therefore heavily reliant upon these third party ratings estimates to determine the quantity of advertising delivered to viewers 
revenue from film asset licensing agreements is recognized when an agreement is executed  the film is available for exhibition by the licensee  the license fee is fixed or reasonably determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and the cost of each film is known or reasonably determinable 
when multiple films are sold under a single arrangement  in order to properly recognize revenue when each license period commences  we must estimate the relative fair value of each film and allocate the total contracted price to the different films in the arrangement 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company has established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical charge off experience 
periodically  we analyze the attributes of the accounts which we have written off during the period and adjust the allowance percentages we apply to our aged receivable balances 
subscriber acquisition fees crown media united states has distribution agreements with every major cable distributor in the united states  some of which require the payment of subscriber acquisition fees 
the initial recoverability of these subscriber acquisition fees is evaluated by projecting the incremental subscriber fee and advertising revenue attributable to the incremental subscribers obtained through the distribution agreement 
this analysis includes significant judgment and estimation by management in terms of the estimated incremental advertising per subscriber 
goodwill valuation goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce fair value below carrying value 
these assets are carried at historical cost if their estimated fair value is greater than their carrying amounts 
however  if their estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  goodwill is reduced to their estimated fair value through an impairment charge to the company s consolidated statements of operations 
film assets determination of film ultimates the company amortizes its film assets using the individual film forecast computation method over a maximum period of years from the date of acquisition 
the individual film forecast computation method amortizes such assets in the same ratio that current period actual revenue bears to estimated unrecognized ultimate revenues 
the company s projections of ultimate revenue regarding sales of certain rights related to its film assets to third parties and anticipated internal use of its film assets are based on the history of each film and similar films  sales and marketing plans  and other factors  all of which require significant judgment by management 
in accordance with sop  the company assesses the ultimate revenue projections on a quarterly basis 
valuation of film assets the company reviews the recoverability of each film on a quarterly basis to assess whether events or circumstance have changed which indicate that the fair value of a film is lower than its net book value 
if the carrying value of any individual film assets exceeds its fair value  the film asset is written down to its fair value 
a discounted cash flow model is used to estimate the fair value of the individual films 
future cash flows are based on the terms of any existing contractual arrangements plus the projected cash inflows from future license sales including assumptions with respect to internal use of such film assets 
the company considers the following factors  among others  in estimating future cash inflows for each film a if previously released  the film s performance in historical markets  b the public s perception of the film s story  cast  director  or producer  c historical results of similar films  d historical results of the cast  director  or producer on prior films  and e running time of the film 
in estimating a film s fair value  the company considers those cash outflows necessary to generate the film s cash inflows 
therefore  future exploitation and participation costs are factored into the estimation of fair value 
in conjunction with the company s conclusion in third quarter that it was more likely than not that the company would dispose of the international rights to the film assets  the company reviewed each of its film assets for impairment 
the company computed fair value of each film using the discounted cash flow model and also considered the indications of fair value that became available during the quarter from an offer letter for the international rights to its film library as a group 
a non cash impairment charge was recorded in the third quarter for each film where the calculated fair value was less than its carrying value at september  the resulting impairment charge was million 
the company received a revised offer letter for the international rights to its film library as a group  from which management determined that it was probable that the sale of international film rights would consummate 
the company computed fair value of each film using the discounted cash flow model based on the revised offer letter 
a non cash impairment charge was recorded in the fourth quarter for each film where the calculated fair value was less than its carrying value at december  the resulting impairment charge was an additional million 
subsequent to year end  the company entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of our international business 
the transaction closed on april  long lived assets also  as a result of obtaining the revised offer letter  the company computed its fair value of certain long lived assets using a discounted cash flows model  and also considered the indication of fair values from the revised offer for such assets that became available during the quarter 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of the property and equipment  subtitling and dubbing and certain other long lived assets using the market approach 
for impairment analysis purposes  the company grouped its property and equipment  subtitling and dubbing and certain other long lived assets and projected cash flows by its international channel 
based on the market approach  the company determined that such assets were impaired at december   and recorded an impairment charge of million 
this amount was comprised of million of property and equipment assets  million of subtitling and dubbing assets  and  of certain other long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the estimated fair value of the impaired assets becomes the new basis for accounting purposes 
as such  approximately million in accumulated amortization and depreciation was eliminated against the cost of these impaired assets in connection with the accounting for these impairments 
program license fees domestic valuations are prepared using historical and future estimated advertising revenues  patterns of film usage as programming content considering day part usage  and the programming environment as it pertains to the domestic channel 
the valuation computes expected annual future revenues generated from program license contracts and compares the expected revenues to the expected amortization of the program license fee assets to determine if an impairment exists 
the international valuations are prepared using historical and future estimates of advertising and subscriber revenues 
the valuation computes expected annual future estimated revenues and compares those estimated revenues to net book value of the program license fee assets to determine if an impairment exists 
where a valuation indicates a loss  additional amortization is provided to currently recognize that loss 
effects of transactions with related and certain other parties hallmark transactions in and in prior years  we entered into a number of significant transactions with hallmark cards and its subsidiaries 
these transactions include  among other things  programming  trademark licenses  administrative services  a line of credit  a tax sharing agreement and the issuance of a million senior unsecured note 
bank credit facility as part of an amendment to our bank credit facility in march   hallmark cards has provided a letter of credit to the lenders for an amount equal to the maximum amount which may be borrowed under the bank credit facility

see bank credit facility below 
tax sharing agreement in march  the company became a member of hallmark cards consolidated federal tax group and entered into a tax sharing agreement with hallmark cards  which was amended at the time the company issued the senior unsecured note to hc crown 
we account for income taxes as if crown media holdings were a separate taxpayer 
accordingly  hallmark cards ability to use our tax losses does not impact our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  including future tax losses 
any payments received from hallmark cards under the tax sharing agreement are recorded as an increase in paid in capital 
for information regarding the tax sharing agreement  please see notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report

total day is the time period measured from the time each day the broadcast of commercially sponsored programming commences to the time such commercially sponsored programming ends 
primetime is defined as pm in the united states 
these nielsen ratings are for the time period january through december crown media holdings evaluates operating performance based on several factors  including adjusted ebitda 
our measure of adjusted ebitda differs from the normal definition of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization used by most companies 
we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  subscriber acquisition fee amortization and amortization of film assets 
we believe adjusted ebitda is meaningful because it provides investors a means to evaluate the operating performance of our company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by other companies in our industry and investment bankers and analysts who track our industry 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance and allows our management and investors to readily view operating trends  perform analytical comparisons and benchmark our company to similar companies in our industry 
adjusted ebitda is used by our management to monitor segment operations and to determine the allocation of resources to segments 
our credit facility also contains covenants that are based on an adjusted ebitda measure 
consequently  management views adjusted ebitda as a critical measure of our operating performance to meet our debt covenants and monitors this measure closely 
we disclose adjusted ebitda so that our investors can have some of the same information available to our management to evaluate their investment in our company 
we believe that adjusted ebitda provides an indication of the company s ability to generate cash flows from operating activities since the majority of our non cash expenses are excluded from our calculation of adjusted ebitda 
a significant portion of the company s cost structure relates to the amortization of film assets and subscriber acquisition costs  which are significant non cash charges 
the cash costs of acquiring film assets and adding subscribers are essentially discretionary expenditures 
the adjusted ebitda calculation allows the company to assess how much is available to pay debt service and gives a further indication of how much remains to fund discretionary expenditures such as the acquisition of film assets or additional subscriber base 
however  adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  historical operating income or loss  net loss  cash flow from operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
adjusted ebitda differs significantly from cash flows from operating activities reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
cash flow from operating activities is net of interest and taxes paid and is a more comprehensive determination of periodic income on a cash basis  exclusive of non cash items of income and expenses such as depreciation and amortization 
in contrast  adjusted ebitda is derived from accrual basis income and is not reduced for cash invested in working capital 
consequently  adjusted ebitda is not affected by the timing of receivable collections or when accrued expenses are paid 
we are not aware of any uniform standards for determining ebitda or our adjusted ebitda and believe presentations of ebitda may not be calculated consistently by different entities in the same or similar businesses 
in the table below  we provide a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss and to net cash used in operating activities of crown media holdings and its subsidiaries

our revenue increased for the year ended december  our increase in subscriber fee revenue for the year ended december   was the result of the expiration of free carriage periods for certain of our domestic distributors and an increase in the number of subscribers in the united kingdom along with foreign exchange fluctuations 
subscriber acquisition fee amortization recorded as a reduction of revenue was million for the year ended december   and million for the comparable period in  as a result of fees required under distribution agreements negotiated in previous years 
eighty seven percent of subscriber fee revenue for the year ended december  and of subscriber fee revenue for the year ended december   was earned internationally 
subscriber fee revenue increased to million for the domestic hallmark channel for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   primarily because of the expiration of free carriage periods 
the increase in advertising revenue reflects the following during the growth in domestic and international subscribers  higher household ratings in the united states  higher advertising rates resulting from the increase in distribution and viewership  and expanded sales of advertising time primarily in the united states 
our domestic advertising revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  additionally  the number of advertisers on our domestic channel rose from at december   to at december  our international advertising revenue  primarily from the united kingdom  increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  revenue from the sale of our film assets totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the comparable period in the decrease reflects a decrease in international sales  due in part to softer market conditions and uncertainty surrounding the potential sale of the international business and international rights to the film assets 
cost of services 
cost of services as a percent of revenue increased to for the year ended december   as compared to in the prior year s period 
these increases were substantially all related to the impairment charges explained below 
non cash impairment charges in a total amount of million related to our film assets and technical operations primarily related to our anticipated disposal of our international assets 
after eliminating this impairment  our cost of services increased approximately over amortization of film assets increased for the year ended december   compared to the same periods in primarily as a result of the impairment of our film assets and related recalculation of amortization 
we anticipate an increase in the amortization of our film assets during because of the use of the film assets by our movie channel 
total programming costs for the year ended december   increased due to the increased costs associated with the amortization of certain programming such as m a s h and jag for our domestic channel 
operating costs for the year ended december   increased million primarily due to a  increase in bad debt expense and a  impairment of subtitling and dubbing assets related to the company s exit from the spain and portugal market 
selling  general and administrative expense

guaranteed preferred beneficial interest accretion 
this expense related to future obligations on our debentures issued on december   in connection with the trust preferred securities of crown media trust 
the expense only included guaranteed preferred beneficial interest accretion for a partial year due to the repurchase of our preferred securities on august  interest expense 
interest expense increased for the year ended december   compared to december   by million 
this increase was primarily due to interest on our million senior unsecured note payable commencing august   which amounted to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year period 
the terms of our senior unsecured note payable do not require any cash payment for interest or principal until august year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
our revenue increased for the year ended december  reduced subscriber fee rates in the united states due to amendments in prior periods to long term distribution agreements and cash basis accounting treatment of certain countries in latin america partially offset our increase in subscriber fee revenue for the year ended december   due to expanded distribution internationally 
subscriber acquisition fee expense recorded as a reduction of revenue was million for the year ended december   and million for the comparable period in although the number of subscribers to the hallmark channel increased as of december   compared to december   subscriber revenue was also affected by a number of other  offsetting factors  including discounts for new subscribers  and the waiver of subscriber fees and bulk discounts resulting from the attainment of certain subscriber levels 
subscribers have increased as a result of amended agreements in the united states and the united kingdom 
ninety percent of subscriber fees revenue for the year ended december   and eighty percent of subscriber fee revenue for the year ended december   respectively  was earned internationally 
the amount of subscriber fee revenue was million for the domestic hallmark channel for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the increase in advertising revenue reflects the following during the growth in domestic and international subscribers  higher ratings in the united states  higher advertising rates resulting from the increase in distribution and viewership  and expanded sales of advertising time primarily in the united states 
the most dramatic increase in advertising revenue came from our domestic channel which was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  additionally  the number of advertisers on our domestic channel rose from at december   to at december  the increase in licensing fees earned during is due to four license agreements accounting for of total license fee revenue 
as demand for our product increased in  we focused our selling effort on a small number of customers 
cost of services 
cost of services as a percent of revenue decreased to in  as compared to in this decrease was primarily due to our increase in total revenue discussed above and the changes in operating expenses explained below 
total programming costs for the year ended december   decreased because crown media holdings recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of of million related to certain programming write offs reflecting the refinement of our programming strategy and projected usage 
excluding the effects of this write off  programming costs in rose because of the acquisition of programming for our domestic and united kingdom channels 
for example  in september  we added three series to our domestic programming schedule mash  matlock and little house on the prairie 
the increase in amortization of film assets was primarily due to increased sales during the full year subscriber acquisition fee expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   respectively 
as the result of the settlement and amendment of certain contractual matters with us distributors  expense of million was recorded during the fourth quarter of which did not recur in operating costs for the year ended december   which include playback  dubbing and subtitling  transponder and interstitial expenses  decreased primarily due to our reorganization and resulting decrease in lower salary and benefit expense of million and lower satellite and transponder expense of million resulting from our reorganization 
subtitling and dubbing expense decreased million due to our exit of certain markets and our decrease in purchases of international programming for our channels in non english speaking countries 
bad debt expense decreased million due to improved collections of receivables primarily in our international markets and a decrease in write offs related to certain foreign accounts 
in addition  during the year ended december   our revenue from domestic advertising and film licensing grew at a significantly higher rate than revenue from international sources and our collection rate on domestic advertising and film licensing has historically been better than international sales 
selling  general and administrative expense 
we recorded compensation expense of million related to our rsus during additionally  expenses for dues and publications  investor relations  bank fees and non income taxes declined during selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased to for  as compared to for this percentage decrease was also due to the increase in total revenue noted above

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we only invest in instruments that meet high credit and quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these instruments  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk 
the fixed income portfolio will decline in value if there is an increase in interest rates 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline of the fair value of the fixed income portfolio would not be material 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments had a fair value of million  which was invested in cash and short term commercial paper 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to fund operations 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is provided by and used in our business 
the value of certain investments in this portfolio can be impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets and interest rate fluctuations 
at december   all of our investments in this category were in fixed rate instruments or money market type accounts 
a decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be reinvested at lower rates as the instruments mature 
over time  any net percentage decrease in our interest rates could be reflected in a corresponding net percentage decrease in our interest income 
for the year ended december   the impact of interest rate fluctuations  changed business prospects and all other factors did not have a material impact on the fair value of this portfolio  or on our income derived from this portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
as of december   we are not hedged or otherwise protected against risks associated with any of our investing or financing activities 
we are exposed to market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes to interest rates 
to reduce the volatility relating to these exposures  we may enter into various derivative investment transactions in the near term pursuant to our investment and risk management policies and procedures in areas such as hedging and counterparty exposure practices 
we have not and will not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
though we intend to use risk management control policies  there will be inherent risks that may only be partially offset by our hedging programs should there be any unfavorable movements in interest rates or equity investment prices 
the estimated exposure discussed below is intended to measure the maximum amount we could lose from adverse market movements in interest rates and equity investment prices  given a specified confidence level  over a given period of time 
loss is defined in the value at risk estimation as fair market value loss 
our interest income and expense is subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
our material interest bearing assets consisted of cash equivalents and short term investments 
the balance of our interest bearing assets was million  or less than of total assets  as of december  our material liabilities subject to interest rate risk consisted of capital lease obligations  our bank credit facility  our line of credit with hc crown and our note payable to hc crown 
the balance of those liabilities was million  or of total liabilities  as of december  net interest expense for the year ended december   was million   of our total revenue 
our net interest expense of these liabilities is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us and libor interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us and libor interest rates affect the fair value of interest bearing liabilities
