item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and other financial information  included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
casella waste systems  inc  together with its subsidiaries  is a vertically integrated regional solid waste services company that provides collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services to residential  industrial and commercial customers  primarily throughout the eastern region of the united states 
as of june   we owned and or operated eight subtitle d landfills  two landfills permitted to accept construction and demolition materials  solid waste collection operations  transfer stations  recycling facilities and one waste to energy facility  as well as a interest in a joint venture that manufactures  markets and sells cellulose insulation made from recycled fiber 
in december  we acquired kti  an integrated provider of waste processing services  for aggregate consideration of million 
kti represented a unique opportunity to acquire disposal capacity and collection operations in our primary market area and in contiguous markets in eastern massachusetts  as well as other businesses which fit within our operating strategy 
following our acquisition of kti in december through  we focused on the integration of kti and the divestiture of non core kti assets 
from to date  we have focused on building our disposal capacity within our footprint  using our partnership model 
we believe we have been successful  since we have added hardwick and southbridge in massachusetts  ontario in upper new york state and west old town in maine  as well as expanded our annual permit limits and overall capacity at our other sites that we own or operate 
in fiscal year we were successful in securing an increase of our permitted volume capacity from to  tons per day at our hakes landfill facility 
at our waste usa landfill facility  the annual permitted volume was amended in fiscal year to allow  tons per year  an increase of  tons from previously approved levels 
in fiscal year  our hyland landfill facility received a necessary local approval for the future expansion of an additional acres  representing approximately million tons of additional capacity subject to receipt of permits 
the annual tons disposed in our landfills have increased from million tons at the beginning of fiscal year to million tons at the end of fiscal year  and total permitted and permittable capacity has increased from tons to million tons at over the same time frame 
we have also closed on tuck in acquisitions during that time  but these have been largely opportunistic 
from may  through april   we have acquired solid waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal operations 
this objective of building disposal capacity is to increase our vertical integration within our footprint to optimize our control of the waste stream from collection through disposal thereby providing an economic benefit 
internalization of waste refers to the amount of waste that our collection companies collect that is ultimately disposed of in one of our disposal facilities 
as a result of our success in building disposal capacity our internalization increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year our revenues increased from million for the fiscal year ended april  to million for the fiscal year ended april  from may  through april   we acquired solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling operations 
under the rules of purchase accounting  the acquired companies revenues and results of operations have been included from the date of acquisition and affect the period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations 
effective september   we transferred our export brokerage operations to former employees who had been responsible for managing that business 
the domestic brokerage operations  and a recycling business  constituting the remainder of our brokerage revenues  were transferred effective june  to the employees of that unit 
due to the structure of these transactions  the transfers were not initially recorded as a sale 
effective april   we completed the sale of the export brokerage operations for total consideration of approximately million 
the gain on the sale amounted to approximately million 
for the fiscal years ended april  and  the transferred brokerage and recycling businesses accounted for million and million  respectively  of our revenues 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of the assets of data destruction services  inc data destruction for cash sale proceeds of million 
this shredding operation had been historically accounted for as a component of continuing operations up until its sale 
the transaction required discontinued operations treatment under sfas no 
 therefore the operating results of data destruction have been reclassified from continuing to discontinued operations in fiscal  and also in connection with the discontinued accounting treatment  the loss net of tax from the sale amounting to million has been recorded and classified as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances 
our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
landfill accounting capitalized costs and amortization we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain landfill costs 
capitalized landfill costs include expenditures for land and related airspace  permitting costs and preparation costs 
landfill permitting and preparation costs represent only direct costs related to these activities  including legal  engineering and construction 
landfill preparation costs include the costs of construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms and the installation of leak detection and leachate collection systems 
interest is capitalized on landfill construction projects while the assets are undergoing activities to ready them for their intended use 
the interest capitalization rate is based on the company s weighted average cost of indebtedness 
interest capitalized for the years ended april   and was  and  respectively 
management routinely reviews its investment in operating landfills  transfer stations and other significant facilities to determine whether the costs of these investments are realizable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and the operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
under life cycle accounting  all costs related to acquisition and construction of landfill sites are capitalized and charged to income based on tonnage placed into each site 
landfill permitting  acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed 
in determining the amortization rate for these landfills  preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills permitted and permittable capacity 
in determining estimated future landfill permitting  acquisition  construction and preparation costs  we consider the landfill costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace 
to be considered permittable  airspace must meet all of the following criteria we control the land on which the expansion is sought  all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained  we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor  we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received within the next two to five years  and senior management has approved the project 
units of consumption amortization rates are determined annually for each of our operating landfills 
the rates are based on estimates provided by our engineers and accounting personnel and consider the information provided by airspace surveys  which are performed at least annually 
significant changes in our estimates could materially increase our landfill depletion rates  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our estimate of future landfill permitting  acquisition  construction and preparation costs as of april  increased to million  compared to million as of april  and million as of april  the increase in estimated costs in fiscal is primarily as a result of additional permitted and permittable airspace from our newly acquired landfill and landfill operating contracts  which increased airspace to million tons as of april  as compared to million tons as of april  and million tons as of april  landfill amortization expense for the years ended april   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was primarily attributable to increased landfill volumes in part resulting from our new landfill operating contracts  which became active in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year higher landfill amortization expense in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year was due to volume increases  the effect of newly acquired landfill operations  and as a result of adopting sfas no 
landfill accounting capping  closure and post closure costs capping includes installation of liners  drainage  compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received 
capping activities occur throughout the life of the landfill 
our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each capping event based on the acreage to be capped and the capping materials and activities required 
the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill 
closure and post closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill  after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes 
we estimate  based on input from our engineers  accounting personnel and consultants  our future cost requirements for closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the subtitle d regulations and the air emissions standards under the clean air act as they are being applied on a state by state basis 
closure and post closure accruals for the cost of monitoring and maintenance include site inspection  groundwater monitoring  leachate management  methane gas control and recovery  and operation and maintenance costs to be incurred for a period which is generally for a term of years after final closure of a landfill 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in determining estimated future closure and post closure costs  we consider costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace 
our estimates of costs to discharge capping  closure and post closure asset retirement obligations for landfills are developed in today s dollars 
these costs are then inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually was used in both fiscal year and 
capping  closure and post closure liabilities are discounted using the credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred to 
accretion expense is necessary to increase the accrued capping  closure and post closure liabilities to the future anticipated obligation 
to accomplish this  we accrete our capping  closure and post closure accrual balances using the same credit adjusted  risk free rate that was used to calculate the recorded liability 
accretion expense on recorded landfill liabilities is recorded to cost of operations from the time the liability is recognized until the costs are paid 
accretion expense amounted to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
our estimate of future capping  closure and post closure costs was million as of april   compared to million as of april  and million as of april  the increase in estimated costs in fiscal is primarily as a result of additional permitted and permittable airspace from our newly acquired landfill operating contracts  which also increased airspace to million tons as of april  compared to million tons as of april  and million tons as of april  we provide for the accrual and amortization of estimated future obligations for closure and post closure based on tonnage placed into each site 
with regards to capping  the liability is recognized and these costs are amortized based on the airspace related to the specific capping event 
accrued capping  closure and post closure costs include the current and non current portion of costs associated with obligations for capping  closure and post closure of our landfills 
the changes to accrued capping  closure and post closure liabilities are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended april  beginning balance  may cumulative effect of change in accounting principle capping  closure  and post closure liability  adjusted obligations incurred revisions in estimates accretion expense payments acquisitions and other adjustments balance  april upon adoption of sfas no 
 on may   we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million net of taxes of million 
in addition we recorded a decrease in our capping  closure and post closure obligations of million  and a decrease in our net landfill assets of million 
for additional information and analyses of the impact that adopting sfas no 
had on our balance sheet and our results of operations for the year ended april   see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
spending levels were higher in fiscal year mainly due to closure activities at our woburn  massachusetts and pine tree  maine landfills 
spending levels increased in fiscal year mainly due to closure activities at our southbridge  massachusetts landfill 
in fiscal year  we recorded closure and post closure accruals relating to the hardwick landfill acquisition 
the increase in fiscal is as a result of capping  closure and post closure accruals relating to the acquisition of the southbridge  massachusetts landfill operating contract 
we estimate our future capping  closure and post closure costs in order to determine the capping  closure and post closure expense per ton of waste placed into each landfill as further described in note l to our consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated timeframe for paying these costs varies based on the remaining useful life of each landfill  as well as the duration of the post closure monitoring period 
based on our permitted and permittable airspace at april   we expect to make payments relative to capping  closure and post closure activities from fiscal year through fiscal year asset impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable 
we evaluate possible impairment by comparing estimated discounted future cash flows to determine with the net book value of long term assets including amortizable intangible assets 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover assets  further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment 
an impairment loss is then recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
upon adoption of sfas no 
we have eliminated the amortization of goodwill and annually assess goodwill impairment at each fiscal year end by applying a fair value based test 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on fair value of each operating segment 
we estimate fair value based on net future cash flows discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
we recognize an impairment if the net book value exceeds the fair value of the discounted future cash flows 
bad debt allowance estimates are used in determining our allowance for bad debts and are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a review of our accounts receivable by aging category 
our reserve is evaluated and revised on a monthly basis 
self insurance liabilities and related costs we are self insured for vehicles and workers compensation 
the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is determined by a third party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability 
we use a third party to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation 
the actuarially determined liability is calculated in part by reference to past claims experience  which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims 
income tax accruals we record income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  calculated using currently enacted tax rates 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that tax benefits may not be realized for certain deferred tax assets 
forward looking statements this form k and other reports  proxy statements  and other communications to stockholders  as well as oral statements by our officers or our agents  may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act  with respect to  among other things  our future revenues  operating income  or earnings per share 
without limiting the foregoing  any statements contained in this form k that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements  and the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors of which we are aware that may cause our actual results to vary materially from those forecasted or projected in any such forward looking statement  certain of which are beyond our control 
our failure to successfully address any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
general revenues our revenues in our north eastern  south eastern  central and western regions are attributable primarily to fees charged to customers for solid waste disposal and collection  landfill  waste to energy  transfer and recycling services 
we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial  industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
the majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual households 
landfill  waste to energy facility and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations 
the majority of our disposal and transfer customers are under one to ten year disposal contracts  with most having clauses for annual cost of living increases 
recycling revenues  which are included in fcr  central and western regions  consist of revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities and operations and maintenance contracts of recycling facilities for municipal customers 
fcr revenues included revenues from commercial brokerage and recycling operations through june  and revenues from the export brokerage business through september  when those operations were sold 
our cellulose insulation business is conducted through a joint venture with louisiana pacific  and accordingly  we recognize half of the joint venture s net income on the equity method in our results of operations 
also  in the other segment  we have ancillary revenues including major customer accounts and earnings from equity method investees 
our revenues are shown net of inter company eliminations 
we typically establish our inter company transfer pricing based upon prevailing market rates 
the table below shows  for the periods indicated  the percentage of our revenues attributable to services provided 
for the fiscal years ended april  and  the percentages of revenues shown below reflect revenues from the domestic brokerage and recycling operations through june  and revenues from the export brokerage business through september the export business was transferred to the employees of that unit in september and our domestic brokerage operations  constituting the remainder of our brokerage revenues  was transferred effective june  to the employees of that unit 
net of brokerage revenues  collection revenues as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal years ended april  and were lower compared to prior year respective periods  despite an increase in the absolute dollar amounts  mainly because of the large increase in recycling revenue dollars 
landfill disposal revenues as a percentage of total revenues  net of brokerage revenues  increased in the fiscal years ended april  and compared to prior year respective periods due to the incremental volumes associated with recently acquired landfill facilities 
recycling revenues increased over the three year period as a percentage of total revenues mainly due to higher commodity prices and volumes 
the decrease in brokerage revenues as a percentage of revenues is due to the transfer of the export and domestic brokerage businesses to employees of those units 
fiscal year ended april  collection landfill disposal facilities transfer recycling brokerage total revenues we revised percentages of total revenues for fiscal years ended april  and to conform with our classification of revenues attributable to services provided in the fiscal year ended april  operating expenses cost of operations includes labor  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  fuel  maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment  worker s compensation and vehicle insurance  the cost of purchasing materials to be recycled  third party transportation expense  district and state taxes  host community fees and royalties 
cost of operations also includes accretion expense related to landfill capping  closure and post closure  leachate treatment and disposal costs and depletion of landfill operating lease obligations 
general and administration expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead  professional services and costs associated with marketing  sales force and community relations efforts 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method  amortization of landfill airspace assets under the units of consumption method  and the amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill using the straight line method 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  except for accretion expense  we amortize landfill retirement assets through a charge to cost of operations using a straight line rate per ton as landfill airspace is utilized 
the amount of landfill amortization expense related to airspace consumption can vary materially from landfill to landfill depending upon the purchase price and landfill site and cell development costs 
we depreciate all fixed and intangible assets  other than goodwill  to a zero net book value  and do not apply a salvage value to any fixed assets 
we capitalize certain direct landfill development costs  such as engineering  permitting  legal  construction and other costs associated directly with the expansion of existing landfills 
additionally  we also capitalize certain third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions  such as legal and engineering costs 
we routinely evaluate all such capitalized costs  and expense those costs related to projects not likely to be successful 
internal and indirect landfill development and acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
we will have material financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs of our existing landfills and any disposal facilities which we may own or operate in the future 
we have provided and will in the future provide accruals for these future financial obligations based on engineering estimates of consumption of permitted landfill airspace over the useful life of any such landfill 
there can be no assurance that our financial obligations for capping  closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationship that certain items from our consolidated financial statements bear in relation to revenues 
fiscal year ended april  revenues cost of operations general and administration depreciation and amortization impairment charge deferred costs operating income interest expense  net income from equity method investments loss on debt extinguishment other expense income  net and minority interest provision benefit for income taxes income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle fiscal year versus fiscal year revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year revenues from the rollover effect of acquired businesses accounted for million of the increase  primarily due to new disposal facilities in the western and south eastern regions the ontario and southbridge landfills  as well as a new recycling facility in the south eastern region  all of which became active in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  partially offset by the loss of revenues from the divestiture of the domestic brokerage business amounting to million 
the revenue increase is also attributable to an increase in solid waste revenues of million  due primarily to higher hauling and transfer volumes in the central region  higher composting volumes in the north eastern region and higher commodity prices which resulted in an increase in recycling revenues of million 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year cost of operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the fiscal year  from in the prior year primarily due to the effect of lower disposal costs as a percentage of revenue from the impact of the activation of new disposal capacity 
the dollar increase in cost of operations expense for fiscal year is primarily due to the effect of higher levels of operating activity and acquired businesses  higher cost of commodity purchases due to higher prices  higher transportation costs as well as higher fuel costs 
general and administration 
general and administration expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year general and administration expenses as a percentage of revenues remained unchanged in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the dollar increase in general and administration expense was due to higher bonus accruals  communications and training costs as well as expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year while depreciation expense increased by million between periods  landfill amortization expense increased by million which was primarily due to higher volumes  in part related to new disposal facilities which became active in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues remained unchanged in fiscal year compared to fiscal year impairment charge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of million consisting of a million write down of our investment in resource optimization technology rot  a compost facility  which we transferred at no cost to a third party in february  a charge of million relating to the sale of buildings and land at our former recycling facility in mechanics falls  maine  and a charge of million related to the discontinuation of an effort to develop a new landfill project in rockingham  vt 
deferred costs 
a charge of million was recorded in fiscal to reflect the write off of deferred development costs associated with unsuccessful negotiations to operate and develop a landfill located in mckean county  pennsylvania 
operating income 
operating income increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and increased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in operating income is primarily due to higher levels of revenue 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year this increase is mainly attributable to higher average debt balances due to higher capital expenditures and payments on landfill operating lease contracts as well as higher average interest rates in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
net interest expense  as a percentage of revenues  increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year income from equity method investments 
income from equity method investments for fiscal years ended april  and was solely from our joint venture interest in greenfiber 
equity income from greenfiber increased million to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase is attributable to higher volume as well as increased pricing 
loss on debt extinguishment 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we entered into a new senior secured credit facility resulting in the write off of million in debt financing costs associated with the old senior secured credit facility 
other expense income  net 
other expense in fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year other expense in fiscal year consisted of the costs of winding down the operations of the new heights power plant and a loss on retirement of fixed assets  partially offset by gains on the sale of equipment and a dividend from our investment in evergreen national indemnity company 
other expense in fiscal year included an million charge for the write down of our investment in the new heights power plant venture and our remaining investment in certain tire recycling operations and the power plant venture 
offsetting this charge  we recognized a gain of million on the completion of our sale of its export recyclables business and other gains  primarily on the sale of trucks and containers  of million 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased million for fiscal year to million from million for fiscal year the effective tax rate increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to a prior year decrease in the valuation allowance for loss carryforwards as utilization of the company s tax losses became more certain 
income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and increased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is due to increased operating income  partially offset by increased interest expense and higher tax expense due to a higher effective tax rate 
the north eastern and south eastern region s income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due primarily to higher costs associated with new disposal facility projects  one of which is not yet fully operational 
western region s income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased from the prior period due to the acquisition of an operating contract at the ontario landfill 
fcr recycling s income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased in fiscal year from due primarily to favorable commodity pricing 
income loss from discontinued operations loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of the assets of data destruction services  inc data destruction for cash sale proceeds of million 
this shredding operation had been historically accounted for as a component of continuing operations up until its sale 
the transaction required discontinued operations treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  therefore the operating results of data destruction have been reclassified from continuing to discontinued operations in fiscal  and also in connection with the discontinued accounting treatment  the loss net of tax from the sale amounting to million has been recorded and classified as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net 
effective may   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the primary modification to our methodology required by sfas no 
is to require that capping  closure and post closure costs be discounted to present value 
upon adoption of sfas no 
we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million net of taxes of million in order to reflect the cumulative change in accounting for landfill obligations retroactive to the date of the inception of the landfill 
fiscal year versus fiscal year revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the revenue increase is attributable to an increase in core solid waste revenues of million  due primarily to higher composting volumes in the north eastern region  higher hauling and transfer volumes in the central and southeastern regions as well as higher landfill volumes in the western region 
higher recycling volumes and prices resulted in a net increase in recycling revenues of million 
loss of revenues from businesses divested  primarily domestic and export brokerage  amounted to million  partially offset by the roll over effect of businesses acquired of million  primarily due to new disposal facilities in the western and south eastern regions ontario  southbridge and hardwick landfills as well as solid waste hauling operations in the central  south eastern and western regions 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year cost of operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the dollar increase in cost of operations expenses is primarily due to the effect of acquired businesses and a net increase in material purchases resulting from higher recycling volumes  which were partially offset by lower commodity purchases resulting from the divestiture of the export and domestic brokerage business 
general and administration 
general and administration expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year general and administration expenses as a percentage of revenues remained unchanged in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the dollar increase in general and administrative costs was due to higher bad debt and travel costs associated with the development of new landfill capacity 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year depreciation expense was up million between periods and landfill amortization expense increased million which was primarily attributable to increased landfill volumes  the effect of newly acquired landfill operations and as a result of adopting sfas no 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue rose to in fiscal year from in fiscal year which resulted from the higher landfill amortization expense 
impairment charge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of million consisting of a million write down of our investment in resource rot  a compost facility  which we intend to transfer at a third party  a charge of million relating to the sale of buildings and land at our former recycling facility in mechanics falls  maine  and a charge of million related to the discontinued rockingham landfill project 
operating income 
operating income decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and decreased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in operating income is primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization attributable to increased landfill volumes  the effect of newly acquired landfill operations and as a result of adopting sfas no 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year this decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates on variable rate debt in the current year  versus the prior period 
interest expense  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year income from equity method investments 
income from equity method investments for fiscal years ended april  and was solely from our joint venture interest in greenfiber 
equity income from greenfiber increased million to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year equity income from greenfiber in fiscal year included a million gain associated with an eminent domain settlement received from a state department of transportation on the involuntary conversion of a portion of a greenfiber leased manufacturing facility 
loss on debt extinguishment 
in fiscal year  we entered into a new senior secured credit facility resulting in the write off of million in debt financing costs associated with the old senior secured credit facility 
minority interest 
minority interest in fiscal year reflects a minority owner s interest in our majority owned subsidiary  american ash recovery technologies aart 
aart completed its ash operation contract and closed its operations in fiscal year other expense income  net 
other expense in fiscal year included an million charge for the write down of our investment in the new heights power plant venture and our remaining investment in certain tire recycling operations and the power plant venture 
offsetting this charge  we recognized a gain of million on the completion of our sale of its export recyclables business and other gains  primarily on the sale of trucks and containers  of million 
other income in fiscal was attributable to a gain of million related to a settlement with oakhurst company  inc  as well as a gain on the divestitures and other assets of million and a gain on the conclusion of the aart contract of million  offset by a million charge for interest rate swap unwind costs 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased million for fiscal year to a benefit of million from a provision of million for fiscal year the effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year this was primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance for loss carryforwards in as utilization of tax losses is more certain  as well as  in  the nondeductible impairment of goodwill and nondeductible losses on business dispositions 
income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and increased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal year from in fiscal year south eastern region s income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due primarily to hauling activities as well as the adoption of sfas no 
north eastern region s income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased due the adoption of sfas partially offset by impairment charges for rot and our mechanic falls facility 
fcr recycling s income from continuing operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to prior year impairment charges associated with domestic brokerage and commercial recycling 
income loss from discontinued operations  net 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of the assets of data destruction 
this shredding operation had been historically accounted for as a component of continuing operations up until its sale 
the transaction required discontinued operations treatment under sfas no 
 therefore the operating results of data destruction have been reclassified from continuing to discontinued operations in fiscal and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net 
effective may   we adopted sfas no 
the primary modification to our methodology required by sfas no 
is to require that capping  closure and post closure costs be discounted to present value

effective may   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which  among other things  eliminates the amortization of goodwill and requires an annual assessment of goodwill impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill was determined to be impaired and the amount of million net of tax benefit of million was charged to earnings in fiscal as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the goodwill impairment charge was related to our waste to energy operation  maine energy  and the brokerage business of the fcr recycling segment  both of which were acquired as part of our acquisition of kti 
at the time of acquisition  we recorded the fair value of these businesses using an independent third party valuation 
the underlying assumptions used to establish the value of these businesses  including earnings projections  commodity pricing assumptions and industry valuation multiples for recycling products  were not realized 
accordingly  goodwill impairment charges were recorded as the net book value of these businesses exceeded their fair value 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive 
our capital requirements include acquisitions  fixed asset purchases and capital expenditures for landfill development and cell construction as well as site and cell closure 
we had a net working capital deficit of million at april  compared to a net working capital deficit of million at april  working capital  net comprises current assets  excluding cash and cash equivalents  minus current liabilities 
the main factors accounting for the decrease were higher trade payables and accrual balances due to higher capital expenditures close to year end  deferred taxes and higher current accruals for capping  closure and post closure costs  partially offset by increases in trade receivables associated with higher revenues in the last month of the year and lower current maturities of long term debt related to the new credit facility as well as payments on various seller financed notes in fiscal on april   we entered into a new senior credit facility with a group of banks for which bank of america is acting as agent 
the new facility consists of a senior secured revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
under certain circumstances we have the option of increasing the credit facility by an additional million provided that we are not in default at the time of the increase  and subject to the receipt of commitments from lenders for such additional amount 
this credit facility is secured by all of our assets  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries 
the new revolving credit facility matures april the initial borrowings under the credit facility were used to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the old term loan and the old revolver 
the former senior credit facility consisted of a million senior secured revolving credit facility and a senior secured term b loan  which had an outstanding balance of million at april  further advances were available under the old revolver and new revolver in the amount of million and million as of april  and  respectively 
these available amounts are net of outstanding irrevocable letters of credit totaling million and as of april  and as of april  and no amounts had been drawn under the outstanding letters of credit 
the new senior revolving credit facility agreement contains covenants that may limit our activities  including covenants that restrict dividends on common stock  limit capital expenditures  and set minimum net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios 
as of april   we were in compliance with all covenants 
we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million as a result of the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the old senior secured credit facility 
we have historically entered into interest rate swap agreements to balance fixed and floating rate debt interest risk in accordance with management s criteria 
the agreements are contracts to exchange fixed and floating interest rate payments periodically over a specified term without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
the agreements provide only for the exchange of interest on the notional amounts at the stated rates  with no multipliers or leverage 
differences paid or received over the life of the agreements are recorded in the consolidated financial statements as additions to or reductions of interest expense on the underlying debt 
we terminated two interest rate swap agreements effective april  concurrent with entering into the new credit facility 
we received net proceeds of million which will be amortized against interest expense over the remaining original term of the swap contracts  to february on may   we entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements with three banks for a notional amount of million 
the contracts are forward starting contracts that will effectively fix the interest index rate on the entire notional amount at from may  through may  as of april   we had outstanding million of senior subordinated notes the notes which mature in january the senior subordinated note indenture contains covenants that restrict dividends  stock repurchases and other payments  and limits the incurrence of debt and issuance of preferred stock 
the notes are guaranteed jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally by our significant wholly owned subsidiaries 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years ended april  and amounted to million and million  respectively 
the increase was mainly due to higher landfill amortization and depreciation expense which increased approximately million 
this was primarily due to higher landfill volumes  in part related to new disposal facilities which became active in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year higher income from equity method investments of million was more than offset by a dividend of million from greenfiber in fiscal year deferred income taxes increased million from the prior year 
depletion of landfill operating lease obligations increased million from the prior year which was due to landfill operating lease contracts entered into in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year the increase from fiscal year to was partially offset by the loss on asset writedown recorded in fiscal year changes in assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures  decreased million from the prior year 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year and fiscal year amounted to million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities was due to lower acquisition activity by million in the current year as well as higher proceeds from divestitures of million and advances to unconsolidated entities of million in fiscal year which did not recur in fiscal year capital expenditures increased million due to increased landfill development as well as real property purchases partially offset by a decrease in payments on landfill operating lease contracts of million related to landfill operating lease agreements entered into during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal year compared to million provided by financing activities in fiscal year the decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to lower net borrowings of million for fiscal year higher net borrowings for fiscal year were utilized primarily to fund acquisition activity 
our capital expenditures were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year capital spending was higher in fiscal year mainly due to capital expenditures related to existing landfills and newly acquired landfill operating contracts 
we expect capital spending to amount to between million and million in fiscal year the expected increase is due to capital expenditures at the newly acquired landfills 
in fiscal year  we acquired ten solid waste hauling and disposal operations for an aggregate consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and million in notes payable and other consideration 
in fiscal year  we acquired ten solid waste hauling operations and one construction and demolition processing facility  which also operates a landfill facility under an operating lease contract for an aggregate consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and million in other consideration 
we also obtained two landfill operating lease contracts in fiscal year for the new landfill operating lease contracts  we made payments totaling million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
we generally meet liquidity needs from operating cash flow 
these liquidity needs are primarily for capital expenditures for vehicles  containers and landfill development  debt service costs and capping  closure and post closure expenditures 
it is our intention to continue to grow organically and through acquisitions 
the funds to do so are expected to be obtained from operations and the our credit facility 
at april  at the company s existing covenant requirements  all of the funds available under that facility could have been drawn without breaching those covenants 
in addition  we have filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec which has not yet become effective 
once declared effective by the sec  we could  from time to time  issue securities there under in an amount of up to million 
however  our ability and willingness to issue securities pursuant to this registration statement will depend on market conditions at the time of any such desired offering and therefore we may not be able to issue such securities on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of april  in thousands and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years fiscal year s april  thereafter total long term debt capital lease obligations interest obligations operating leases closure post closure redeemable preferred securities total contractual cash obligations interest obligations based on long term debt and capital lease balances as of april  interest obligations related to variable rate debt was calculated using variable rates in effect at april  includes obligations related to landfill operating lease contracts 
assumes redemption on the seventh anniversary of the closing date at the book value which includes all accrued and unpaid dividends 
contractual cash obligations do not include accounts payable or accrued liabilities  which will be paid in fiscal year we believe that our cash provided internally from operations together with our senior secured credit facility should enable us to meet our working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we have implemented a fuel surcharge program  which is designed to recover fuel price fluctuations 
we therefore believe we should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases  particularly during periods of high inflation 
our business is located mainly in the eastern united states 
therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region  such as state regulations and severe weather conditions 
we are unable to forecast or determine the timing and or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these new standards significantly modified the accounting rules related to accounting for business acquisitions  amortization of intangible assets and the method of accounting for impairments of existing goodwill 
the effective date for sfas no 
was fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
 among other things  eliminates the amortization of goodwill and requires an annual assessment of goodwill impairment by applying a fair value based test 
sfas no 
requires that any goodwill recorded in connection with an acquisition consummated on or after july  not be amortized 
we performed an impairment test as of may  and goodwill was determined to be impaired and the amount of million net of tax benefit of million was charged to earnings as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the goodwill impairment is associated with the assets acquired by us in connection with its acquisition of kti 
remaining goodwill will be tested for impairment on an annual basis and further impairment charges may result 
in accordance with the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
 remaining goodwill will not be amortized going forward 
the following schedule reflects net income loss and earnings loss per share for fiscal year adjusted to exclude impairment charges dollars in thousands  except for per share data

 accounting for asset retirement obligations was adopted effective may  through april  we recognized expenses associated with i amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and ii future closure and post closure obligations on a units of consumption basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill 
this practice  referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry  continues to be followed  with the exception of capitalized and future landfill capping costs 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 future capping costs are identified by specific capping event and amortized over the specific estimated capacity related to that event rather than over the life of the entire landfill  as was the practice prior to our adoption of sfas no 
the primary modification to our methodology required by sfas no 
is that capping  closure and post closure costs be discounted to present value 
our estimates of future capping  closure and post closure costs historically have not taken into account discounts for the present value of costs to be paid in the future 
under sfas no 
 our estimates of costs to discharge asset retirement obligations for landfills are developed in today s dollars 
these costs were are then inflated by to reflect a normal escalation of prices up to the year they are expected to be paid 
these estimated costs were then discounted to their present value using a credit adjusted risk free rate of 
under sfas no 
 except for accretion expense  we no longer accrue landfill retirement obligations through a charge to cost of operations  but rather by an increase to landfill assets 
under sfas no 
 the amortizable landfill assets include not only the landfill development costs incurred but also the recorded capping  closure and post closure liabilities  as well as the cost estimates for future capping  closure and post closure costs 
the landfill asset is amortized over the total capacity of the landfill  as airspace is consumed during the life of the landfill with one exception 
the exception is for capping for which both the recognition of the liability and the amortization of these costs are based instead on the airspace consumed for the specific capping event 
upon adoption  sfas no 
required a cumulative change in accounting for landfill obligations retroactive to the date of the inception of the landfill 
inception of the asset retirement obligation is the date operations commenced or the date the asset was acquired 
to do this  sfas no 
required the creation of the related landfill asset  net of accumulated amortization  and an adjustment to the capping  closure and post closure liability for cumulative accretion 
at may   the company recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of  net of taxes of 
in addition we recorded a decrease in our capping  closure and post closure obligations of  and a decrease in our net landfill assets of  the following is a summary of the balance sheet changes for landfill assets and capping  closure and post closure liabilities at may  in thousands balance at april  change balance at may  landfill assets accumulated amortization net landfill assets capping  closure  and post closure liabilities the pro forma effects of the application of sfas as if the statement had been adopted on may   rather than may   using may  costs  assumptions and interest rates are presented below in thousands fiscal year ended april  net loss income available to common stockholders  as reported reversal of closure and post closure expense  net of tax amortization expense  net of tax accretion expense  net of tax pro forma net loss income reported net loss income per common share pro forma net loss income per common share the pro forma asset retirement obligation liability balances as if sfas had been adopted on may   rather than may   are as follows april  accrued capping  closure and post closure costs  as reported pro forma accrued capping  closure and post closure costs in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
fin r requires unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries 
fin r was effective for periods ending after december  for public companies 
as of april  and  we had no material variable interest entities requiring consolidation under fin r 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r replaces sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
requiring public companies to recognize compensation expense for the cost of awards of equity instruments 
this compensation cost will be measured as the fair value of the award on the grant date estimated using an option pricing model 
sfas r was originally issued with implementation required for interim and annual periods beginning after june  on april   the securities and exchange commission sec amended the effective date to the beginning of the first fiscal year after june  we are evaluating the various transition provisions under sfas r and will adopt sfas r effective may   which is expected to result in increased compensation expense in future periods 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
the company s increased leverage may restrict its future operations and impact its ability to make future acquisitions 
the company s indebtedness has substantially increased 
the payment of interest and principal due under this indebtedness has reduced  and may continue to reduce  funds available for other business purposes  including capital expenditures and acquisitions 
in addition  the aggregate amount of indebtedness has limited and may continue to limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  and thereby may limit its acquisition program 
the company may not be successful in making acquisitions of solid waste assets  including developing additional disposal capacity  or in integrating acquired businesses or assets  which could limit the company s future growth 
the company s strategy envisions that a substantial part of the company s future growth will come from making acquisitions of traditional solid waste assets or operations and acquiring or developing additional disposal capacity 
these acquisitions may include tuck in acquisitions within the company s existing markets  assets that are adjacent to or outside the company s existing markets  or larger  more strategic acquisitions 
in addition  from time to time the company may acquire businesses that are complementary to the company s core business strategy 
the company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates 
if the company identifies suitable acquisition candidates  the company may be unable to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to the company 
furthermore  the company may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval to complete potential acquisitions 
the company s ability to achieve the benefits the company anticipates from acquisitions  including cost savings and operating efficiencies  depends in part on the company s ability to successfully integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with the company s operations 
the integration of acquired businesses and other assets may require significant management time and company resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing management of the company s existing operations 
in addition  the process of acquiring  developing and permitting additional disposal capacity is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
for example  the company is currently involved in litigation with the town of bethlehem  new hampshire relating to the expansion of a landfill owned by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  north country environmental services  inc moreover  the disposal capacity at the company s existing landfills is limited by the remaining available volume at the company s landfills and annual  quarterly and or daily disposal limits imposed by the various governmental authorities with jurisdiction over the company s landfills 
the company typically reaches or approximates the company s daily  quarterly and annual maximum permitted disposal capacity at the majority of the company s landfills 
if the company is unable to develop or acquire additional disposal capacity  the company s ability to achieve economies from the internalization of the company s waste stream will be limited and the company may be required to increase the company s utilization of disposal facilities owned by third parties  which could reduce the company s revenues and or the company s operating margins 
the company s ability to make acquisitions is dependent on the availability of adequate cash and the attractiveness of the company s stock price 
the company anticipates that any future business acquisitions will be financed through cash from operations  borrowings under the company s senior secured credit facility  the issuance of shares of the company s class a common stock and or seller financing 
the company may not have sufficient existing capital resources and may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital resources on terms satisfactory to the company  if at all  in order to meet the company s capital requirements for such acquisitions 
the company also believes that a significant factor in the company s ability to close acquisitions will be the attractiveness to the company and to persons selling businesses to the company of the company s class a common stock as consideration for potential acquisition candidates 
this attractiveness may  in large part  be dependent upon the relative market price and capital appreciation prospects of the company s class a common stock compared to the equity securities of the company s competitors 
the trading price of the company s class a common stock on the nasdaq national market has limited the company s willingness to use the company s equity as consideration and the willingness of sellers to accept the company s shares and as a result has limited  and could continue to limit  the size and scope of the company s acquisition program 
environmental regulations and litigation could subject the company to fines  penalties  judgments and limitations on the company s ability to expand 
the company is subject to potential liability and restrictions under environmental laws  including those relating to transport  recycling  treatment  storage and disposal of wastes  discharges to air and water  and the remediation of contaminated soil  surface water and groundwater 
the waste management industry has been and will continue to be subject to regulation  including permitting and related financial assurance requirements  as well as to attempts to further regulate the industry through new legislation 
the company s waste to energy facility is subject to regulations limiting discharges of pollution into the air and water  and the company s solid waste operations are subject to a wide range of federal  state and  in some cases  local environmental  odor and noise and land use restrictions 
for example  the company s waste to energy facility in biddeford  maine is affected by zoning restrictions and air emissions limitations in its efforts to implement a new odor control system 
if the company is not able to comply with the requirements that apply to a particular facility or if the company operates without necessary approvals  the company could be subject to civil  and possibly criminal  fines and penalties  and the company may be required to spend substantial capital to bring an operation into compliance or to temporarily or permanently discontinue  and or take corrective actions  possibly including removal of landfilled materials  regarding an operation that is not permitted under the law 
the company may not have sufficient insurance coverage for the company s environmental liabilities 
those costs or actions could be significant to the company and impact the company s results of operations  as well as the company s available capital 
environmental and land use laws also impact the company s ability to expand and  in the case of the company s solid waste operations  may dictate those geographic areas from which the company must  or  from which the company may not  accept waste 
those laws and regulations may limit the overall size and daily waste volume that may be accepted by a solid waste operation 
if the company is not able to expand or otherwise operate one or more of the company s facilities because of limits imposed under environmental laws  the company may be required to increase the company s utilization of disposal facilities owned by third parties  which could reduce the company s revenues and or operating margins 
the company has historically grown and intends to continue to grow through acquisitions  and the company has tried and will continue to try to evaluate and limit environmental risks and liabilities presented by businesses to be acquired prior to the acquisition 
it is possible that some liabilities  including ones that may exist only because of the past operations of an acquired business  may prove to be more difficult or costly to address than the company anticipates 
it is also possible that government officials responsible for enforcing environmental laws may believe an issue is more serious than the company expects  or that the company will fail to identify or fully appreciate an existing liability before the company becomes legally responsible to address it 
some of the legal sanctions to which the company could become subject could cause the company to lose a needed permit  or prevent the company from or delay the company in obtaining or renewing permits to operate the company s facilities or harm the company s reputation 
the company s operating program depends on the company s ability to operate and expand the landfills the company owns and leases and to develop new landfill sites 
localities where the company operates generally seek to regulate some or all landfill operations  including siting and expansion of operations 
the laws adopted by municipalities in which the company s landfills are located may limit or prohibit the expansion of the landfill as well as the amount of waste that the company can accept at the landfill on a daily  quarterly or annual basis and any effort to acquire or expand landfills typically involves a significant amount of time and expense 
for example  expansion at the company s north county environmental services landfill  outside the original acres  will be prohibited as a result of a recent decision by the new hampshire supreme court unless the company prevails in certain remanded issues under zoning laws or the town revises its local ordinance prohibiting expansions 
in addition  operation of the templeton landfill will require repeal of a town by law prohibiting the acceptance of out of town waste 
the company may not be successful in obtaining new landfill sites or expanding the permitted capacity of any of the company s current landfills once their remaining disposal capacity has been consumed 
if the company is unable to develop additional disposal capacity  the company s ability to achieve economies from the internalization of the company s wastestream will be limited and the company will be required to utilize the disposal facilities of the company s competitors 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations  the company incurs costs defending against environmental litigation brought by governmental agencies and private parties 
the company is  and also may be in the future  a defendant in lawsuits brought by parties alleging environmental damage  personal injury  and or property damage 
the company s operations would be adversely affected if the company does not have access to sufficient capital 
the company s ability to remain competitive and sustain the company s operations depends in part on cash flow from operations and the company s access to capital 
the company currently funds the company s cash needs primarily through cash from operations and borrowings under the company s senior secured credit facility 
however  the company may require additional equity and or debt financing for debt repayment and equity redemption obligations and to fund the company s growth and operations 
in addition  if the company undertakes more acquisitions or further expands the company s operations  the company s capital requirements may increase 
the company may not have access to the amount of capital that the company requires from time to time  on favorable terms or at all 
the company s results of operations could continue to be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials 
the company s results of operations have been and may continue to be affected by changing purchase or resale prices or market requirements for recyclable materials 
the company s recycling business involves the purchase and sale of recyclable materials  some of which are priced on a commodity basis 
the resale and purchase prices of  and market demand for  recyclable materials  particularly waste paper  plastic and ferrous and aluminum metals  can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond the company s control 
although the company seeks to limit the company s exposure to fluctuating commodity prices through the use of hedging agreements and long term supply contracts with customers  these fluctuations have in the past contributed  and may continue to contribute  to significant variability in the company s period to period results of operations 
the company s business is geographically concentrated and is therefore subject to regional economic downturns 
the company s operations and customers are principally located in the eastern united states 
therefore  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to regional economic downturns and other regional factors  including state regulations and budget constraints and severe weather conditions 
in addition  as the company expands in the company s existing markets  opportunities for growth within these regions will become more limited and the geographic concentration of the company s business will increase 
maine energy may be required to make a payment in connection with the payoff of certain obligations and limited partner loans earlier than the company had anticipated and which may exceed the amount of the liability the company recorded in connection with the kti acquisition 
under the terms of waste handling agreements among the biddeford saco waste handling committee  the cities of biddeford and saco  maine  and the company s subsidiary maine energy  maine energy will be required  following the date on which the bonds that financed maine energy and certain limited partner loans to maine energy are paid in full  to pay a residual cancellation payment to the respective municipalities party to those agreements equal to a certain percentage of the fair market value of the equity of the partners in maine energy 
in connection with the company s merger with kti  the company estimated the fair market value of maine energy as of the date the limited partner loans are anticipated to be paid in full  and recorded a liability equal to the applicable percentage of such amount 
the obligation has been estimated by management at million 
management believes the possibility of material loss in excess of this amount is remote 
the company s estimate of the fair market value of maine energy may not prove to be accurate  and in the event the company has underestimated the value of maine energy  the company could be required to recognize unanticipated charges  in which case the company s operating results could be harmed 
in connection with these waste handling agreements  the cities of biddeford and saco have lawsuits pending in the state of maine seeking the residual cancellation payments and alleging  among other things  the company s breach of the waste handling agreement for the company s failure to pay the residual cancellation payments in connection with the kti merger  failure to pay off limited partner loans in accordance with the terms of the agreement and processing amounts of waste above contractual limits without issuance of proper notice 
the complaint seeks damages for breach of contract and a court order requiring the company to provide an accounting of all relevant transactions since may  the company is currently engaged in settlement negotiations with the cities of biddeford and saco  however  at this stage it is impossible to predict whether a settlement will be reached 
if the plaintiffs are successful in their claims against the company and damages are awarded  the company s operating income in the period in which such a claim is paid would be impacted 
the company may not be able to effectively compete in the highly competitive solid waste services industry 
the solid waste services industry is highly competitive  has undergone a period of rapid consolidation and requires substantial labor and capital resources 
some of the markets in which the company competes or will likely compete are served by one or more of the large national or multinational solid waste companies  as well as numerous regional and local solid waste companies 
intense competition exists not only to provide services to customers  but also to acquire other businesses within each market 
some of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than the company 
from time to time  competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid contract 
these practices may either require the company to reduce the pricing of the company s services or result in the company s loss of business 
as is generally the case in the industry  some municipal contracts are subject to periodic competitive bidding 
the company may not be the successful bidder to obtain or retain these contracts 
if the company is unable to compete with larger and better capitalized companies  or to replace municipal contracts lost through the competitive bidding process with comparable contracts or other revenue sources within a reasonable time period the company s revenues would decrease and the company s operating results would be harmed 
in the company s solid waste disposal markets the company also competes with operators of alternative disposal and recycling facilities and with counties  municipalities and solid waste districts that maintain their own waste collection  recycling and disposal operations 
these entities may have financial advantages because user fees or similar charges  tax revenues and tax exempt financing may be more available to them than to the company 
the company s greenfiber insulation manufacturing joint venture with louisiana pacific corporation competes with other parties  principally national manufacturers of fiberglass insulation  which have substantially greater resources than greenfiber does  which they could use for product development  marketing or other purposes to the company s detriment 
the company s results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected if the company inadequately accrues for capping  closure and post closure costs 
the company has material financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs of the company s existing landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any disposal facilities which the company may own or operate in the future 
once the permitted capacity of a particular landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized  the landfill must be closed and capped  and post closure maintenance started 
the company establishes accruals for the estimated costs associated with such capping  closure and post closure obligations over the anticipated useful life of each landfill on a per ton basis 
in addition to the landfills the company currently operates  the company owns six unlined landfills  which are not currently in operation 
the company has provided and will in the future provide accruals for financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs of the company s owned or operated landfills  generally for a term of years after final closure of a landfill 
the company s financial obligations for capping  closure or post closure costs could exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose 
such a circumstance could result in significant unanticipated charges 
fluctuations in fuel costs could affect the company s operating expenses and results 
the price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events beyond the company s control  including among others  geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by opec and other oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries and regional production patterns 
because fuel is needed to run the company s fleet of trucks  price escalations for fuel increase the company s operating expenses 
in fiscal  the company used approximately million gallons of diesel fuel in the company s solid waste operations 
although many of the company s customer contracts permit the company to pass on some or all fuel increases to the company s customers  the company may choose not to do so for competitive reasons 
the company could be precluded from entering into contracts or obtaining permits if the company is unable to obtain third party financial assurance to secure the company s contractual obligations 
public solid waste collection  recycling and disposal contracts  obligations associated with landfill closure and the operation and closure of waste to energy facilities may require performance or surety bonds  letters of credit or other means of financial assurance to secure the company s contractual performance 
if the company is unable to obtain the necessary financial assurance in sufficient amounts or at acceptable rates  the company could be precluded from entering into additional municipal solid waste collection contracts or from obtaining or retaining landfill management contracts or operating permits 
any future difficulty in obtaining insurance could also impair the company s ability to secure future contracts conditioned upon the contractor having adequate insurance coverage 
the company may be required to write off capitalized charges or intangible assets in the future  which could harm the company s earnings 
any write off of capitalized costs or intangible assets reduces the company s earnings and  consequently  could affect the market price of the company s class a common stock 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company capitalizes certain expenditures and advances relating to the company s acquisitions  pending acquisitions  landfills and development projects 
from time to time in future periods  the company may be required to incur a charge against earnings in an amount equal to any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances  net of any portion thereof that the company estimates will be recoverable  through sale or otherwise  relating to any operation that is permanently shut down or has not generated or is not expected to generate sufficient cash flow  any pending acquisition that is not consummated  any landfill or development project that is not expected to be successfully completed  and any goodwill or other intangible assets that are determined to be impaired 
the company has incurred such charges in the past 
the company s revenues and the company s operating income experience seasonal fluctuations 
the company s transfer and disposal revenues have historically been lower during the months of november through march 
this seasonality reflects the lower volume of waste during the late fall  winter and early spring months primarily because the volume of waste relating to construction and demolition activities decreases substantially during the winter months in the north eastern united states  and decreased tourism in vermont  maine and eastern new york during the winter months tends to lower the volume of waste generated by commercial and restaurant customers  which is partially offset by increased volume from the winter ski industry 
since certain of our operating and fixed costs remain constant throughout the fiscal year  operating income is therefore impacted by a similar seasonality 
in addition  particularly harsh weather conditions typically result in increased operating costs 
the company s recycling business experiences increased volumes of newspaper in november and december due to increased newspaper advertising and retail activity during the holiday season 
the company s cellulose insulation joint venture experiences lower sales in march and april due to lower retail activity 
efforts by labor unions to organize the company s employees could divert management attention and increase the company s operating expenses 
labor unions regularly make attempts to organize the company s employees  and these efforts will likely continue in the future 
certain groups of the company s employees have chosen to be represented by unions  and the company has negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these groups 
the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income 
if the company is unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements  the company might have to wait through cooling off periods  which are often followed by union initiated work stoppages  including strikes 
depending on the type and duration of any labor disruptions  the company s revenues could decrease and the company s operating expenses could increase  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as of june   approximately of the company s employees involved in collection  transfer  disposal  recycling or other operations  including the company s employees at the company s maine energy waste to energy facility  were represented by unions 
the company s class b common stock has ten votes per share and is held exclusively by john w 
casella and douglas r 
casella 
the holders of the company s class b common stock are entitled to ten votes per share and the holders of the company s class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share 
at june   an aggregate of  shares of the company s class b common stock  representing  votes  were outstanding  all of which were beneficially owned by john w
