item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following presents management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
all share data have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to stock splits and stock dividends 
the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
page critical accounting policy the company s most significant critical accounting policy is the determination of its allowance for loan losses 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both very important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
what makes these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex is the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain

overview our founders recognized an opportunity to fulfill the financial service needs of individuals and organizations left underserved by consolidation within the financial services industry 
to fill a part of this void  we began in the process by which southern community financial corporation was created  finally beginning operations on november  from inception  we have strived to serve the financial needs of small to medium sized businesses  individuals  residential homebuilders and others in and around winston salem and the piedmont triad area of north carolina 
we offer a broad array of banking and other financial products products similar to those offered by our larger competitors  but with an emphasis on superior customer service 
we believe that our emphasis on quality customer service is the single most important factor among many that have fueled our growth to billion in total assets in just over eight years of operations 
we began operations in november with million in capital  a single branch facility and thirteen employees 
through december   southern community financial corporation has grown to a total of eighteen full service banking offices with million in customer deposit accounts 
in support of this growth  we have generated million of additional capital through sales of common stock in  and through our banking subsidiary we offer traditional banking products as well as a full array of financial services 
more recently we have created a trust department that began operating in the first quarter of in october of  we formed southern community financial corporation  a financial holding company  to become the parent company of southern community bank and trust 
on january  the company acquired the community bank 
in the later part of june  the community bank subsidiary converted its primary operating system 
in october  southern community bank and trust also converted to this same operating system and the two bank subsidiaries were merged into one charter retaining the southern community bank and trust name and began in house core processing for the consolidated bank 
in addition  at the end of august  the bank acquired two residential mortgage offices from davidson mortgage davidson  one office in cornelius  north carolina and the other in lexington  south carolina 
real estate secured loans  including construction loans and loans secured by existing commercial and residential properties  comprise the majority of our loan portfolio  with the balance of our loans consisting of commercial and industrial loans and loans to individuals 
through associations with various mortgage lending companies  we originate residential mortgages  at both fixed and variable rates  earning fees for loans originated and additional income for loans sold to others 
it has been our strategy to recruit skilled banking professionals who are well trained and highly knowledgeable about our market area  enabling us to develop and maintain a loan portfolio of sound credit quality 
we recognize that our growth may expose us to increased operational and market risk  primarily with respect to managing overhead  funding costs and credit quality 
we have developed critical functions such as training  audit  compliance and credit administration to assist in managing and monitoring these and other risks 
we are committed to creating a solid and diversified financial services organization with a focus on customer service 
it is our firm belief that this foundation will continue building our loyal customer base while attracting new clients and providing opportunities for future growth 
as bank consolidations continue to take place in our marketplace  southern community financial corporation is positioned to continue to benefit from their effects 
please note that the company completed the acquisition of the community bank in the first quarter of this transaction provided much of the company s year over year growth 
at december  community s balance sheet had total assets of million 
significant balance sheet categories included million of investment securities  million of loans  million of deposits and million of capital 
additionally  in the first quarter of the company announced the redemption of all of its cumulative convertible trust preferred securities issued through southern community capital trust i 
the securities were redeemed on march  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock through conversions and the retirement of  of the convertible trust preferred securities 
on january   the company announced the declaration page of its first annual cash dividend of per share of its common stock which was paid on march   to shareholders of record on february  on january   the company announced the declaration of its second annual cash dividend of per share of its common stock which was paid on march   to shareholders of record on february  financial condition at december  and during the year ended december   our total assets increased by million  or  to billion 
of this increase in total assets  million represented growth in interest earning assets 
continued strong loan demand resulted in an increase of million  or  in net loans receivable 
investment securities  available for sale and held to maturity  increased by million and million  respectively 
growth in the investment portfolio is primarily due to the addition of the community bank in the first quarter of while community s loan portfolio accounted for the million increase in net loan growth during the first quarter of  strong loan demand during the balance of the year resulted in million of additional loan growth for the company 
federal funds sold  with an average annual return of  is the lowest yielding among interest earning assets 
premises and equipment increased by million net of depreciation  principally as a result of the community acquisition 
other assets increased by million during the year  and in addition million of goodwill was created as a result of purchase accounting associated with the community and davidson transactions 
loan growth in was concentrated in commercial and real estate lending 
our total loan growth of million in was spread among portfolios secured by residential and commercial mortgages  which increased by million and million  respectively 
commercial and industrial lending and construction loan outstandings increased by million and million  respectively during the year 
consumer lending increased million from levels as community s addition more than offset the attrition in the residual southeastern acceptance loan portfolio 
during we continued our active program of originations of residential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market 
at the end of the year mortgage loans held for sale totaled million 
our total liquid assets  defined as cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and investment securities  increased by million during the year  to million at december  versus million at the beginning of the year 
liquid assets represented of total assets at december  as compared to at the beginning of the year 
we have been able to further leverage our capital and generate significant funds for investment both through deposit growth and through borrowings 
however  our funding growth has been used primarily to fund strong loan demand 
customer deposits continue to be our primary funding source 
while our deposits are primarily generated through our growing branch network  we do utilize some out of market and brokered deposits as a funding source 
brokered and out of market deposits totaled million and million at year end and  respectively 
at december   deposits totaled million  an increase of million or from year end we have also utilized borrowings to fund growth in total borrowings  including million in trust preferred securities issued during  aggregated million at december  borrowings also included million of advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb  federal funds purchased of million and securities sold under agreements to repurchase of million 
we will use fhlb advances and other funding sources as necessary to support balance sheet management and growth 
however  we believe that as our branch network grows and matures  the volume of core deposits will become an increasingly larger portion of our funding mix  which should contribute to a reduction in our overall funding cost 
our capital position remains strong  with all of our regulatory capital ratios at levels that make us well capitalized under federal bank regulatory capital guidelines 
at december   our stockholders equity totaled million  an increase of million from the december  balance 
this net increase includes million of shares issued in association with the community transaction  million associated with the conversion of trust preferred securities  million of net income earned during the year  million of stock options exercised during the year  and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of million 
page net interest income like most financial institutions  the primary component of our earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investments  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume and changes in interest rates earned and paid 
by volume  we mean the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
spread and margin are influenced by the levels and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as by levels of noninterest bearing liabilities 
during the years ended december   and  our average interest earning assets were billion  million  and million  respectively 
during these same years  our net interest margins were  and  respectively 
average balances and average rates earned and paid

page rate volume analysis the following table analyzes the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the table distinguishes between i changes attributable to volume changes in volume multiplied by the prior period s rate  ii changes attributable to rate changes in rate multiplied by the prior period s volume  and iii net change the sum of the previous columns

our net income for was million  an increase of million from net income of million earned in net income per share was 
basic and 
diluted for the year ended december   up from 
basic and 
diluted for we have continued to experience strong growth  in most part due to the acquisition of community  with total assets averaging billion during the current year as compared to million in  an increase of 
in absolute terms  our net interest income after provision for loan losses increased by million and our non interest income grew by million to million 
however this growth did not keep pace with the million increase in non interest expenses 
provision expense for loans remained relatively unchanged from the prior year 
during the first half of the bank endured a historically low interest rate environment which hampered our asset yields 
as the federal reserve increased the targeted federal funds rate in july of  the prime rate increased for the first time since june of in the last half of  the prime rate increased basis points to 
while it is management s goal to remain relatively interest rate neutral  the institution is slightly asset sensitive and does benefit from rising rate environment 
as a result of our growth in interest earning assets community transaction coupled with strong loan demand combined with lower funding costs and rising interest rates during the later portion of the year  our net interest income increased million 
our expense growth included some non recurring merger related costs as well as personnel and other infrastructure costs associated with bringing in core in house processing as well as item capture and other expansion of our business 
while these expenses represent investments in building and refining our franchise for the future  their initial effect hampers earnings 
page net interest income 
during  our net interest income increased by million or to million 
our growth in interest income was the result of growth in our overall level of average earning assets due to the community transaction as well as strong loan demand 
average total interest earning assets increased million or  during as compared to  while our average yield dropped by basis points from to 
the rates earned on a significant portion of our loans adjust immediately when index rates such as our prime rate changes 
conversely  most of our interest bearing liabilities  including certificates of deposit and borrowings  have rates fixed until maturity 
as a result  interest rate increases generally result in an immediate increase in our interest income on loans 
there is a more delayed impact on interest expense because most reductions in interest costs only occur upon renewals of certificates of deposit or borrowings 
our average total interest bearing liabilities increased by million  or 
with rates sustained at lower levels for the first half of  our average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points from to  allowing our interest rate spread to increase basis points 
for the year ended december   our net interest spread was and our net interest margin was

in november of the company  through its non bank subsidiary southern community capital trust ii  issued  trust preferred securities generating total proceeds of million 
the securities pay distributions at an annual rate of and mature on december  the principal use of the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures was to provide cash for the acquisition of the community bank  to increase our regulatory capital  and to support the growth and operations of our subsidiary bank 
while this transaction has strengthened the company s overall financial condition  its fixed rate coupon will initially hamper our margins given the current interest rate environment 
the company has entered into a million notional amount receive fixed  pay floating interest rate swap to manage the impact of this transaction on the company s margin and consolidated asset liability position 
on a net basis this swap reduced interest expense by  in we believe that our balance sheet is well positioned to produce consistent growing results in the future as the company continues to expand our marketplace 
provision for loan losses 
we recorded a million provision for loan loss for the year ended december   representing a slight decrease of  from the million provision we made for the year ended december  the level of provisions for is consistent with that of the loan growth  excluding the community transaction  and net charge offs that the bank experienced in the previous year 
gross loans increased million in and in excluding the million of loans contributed through the community acquisition 
provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring our allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management based on the factors discussed under analysis of allowance for loan losses 
while the dollar amount of provisions remained relatively flat on a year over year basis  the level of the allowance to period ending loans increased basis points from the prior year end to 
in addition to loan growth affecting our provision for loan losses  net loan charge offs  which remained relatively stable  totaling million for both and  also impacted the provision expense 
on an annualized basis  our percentage of net loan charge offs to average loans outstanding was 
for the year ended december  as compared with 
for the year ended december  our consumer finance lending portfolio accounted for  or of net charge offs during  a decrease of  from the prior year 
management decided the consumer finance business was no longer part of the company s strategic direction  and during the fourth quarter of ceased originating new consumer finance loans 
it is expected that the residual consumer finance loan portfolio will payoff over a twenty four month time frame and the company s level of charge offs as a percentage of loan outstandings will decline 
nonperforming loans totaled million or 
of total loans at december   as compared with  or 
of total loans at december  the allowance for loan losses at december  of million represents of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses at december  of million equaled of total loans outstanding at that date 
non interest income 
for the year ended december   non interest income increased million  or  to million from million for the prior year despite declines in investment brokerage and mortgage origination fees 
this favorable increase resulted primarily from an increase of million  or to million  in service charges and fees on deposit accounts due to the addition of community coupled with deposit growth and the benefit of a full year of the overdraft protection service implemented during non interest income also benefited from a one time gain received on the community bank s investment in sidus financial  llc sidus 
sidus was a mortgage banking company that served community bank and mortgage broker customers 
on october   sidus was sold for a combination of cash  stock and future consideration if certain performance targets are met 
as a result of this transaction  the company realized a pre tax gain of  in addition  during the fourth quarter the company posted a pre tax gain of  on our investment in salem capital partners  lp income from investment brokerage fees decreased from the prior year by  or  to  the strong results page were due to a new investment product that was offered for a limited time 
fees on the origination of residential mortgage loans sold into the secondary market declined  to  as the level of home mortgage refinancings dramatically slowed from the levels experienced in and due to the low interest rate environment in those periods 
while market conditions may not provide the opportunities to generate fee income similar to those levels we experienced in  management is committed to growing our non interest income base through continued support of those areas that generate our fee income 
non interest expense 
we strive to maintain non interest expenses at levels that we believe are appropriate given the nature of our operations and the investments in personnel and facilities that have been necessary to support our growth 
from forward  we have consistently maintained our ratio of non interest expenses to average total assets below 
for our ratio was  down from a ratio of in because of our continued strong growth we have seen increases in every major component of our non interest expenses 
for the year ended december   our non interest expense increased million  or

occupancy and equipment expense increased million  or  reflecting the expenses associated with our continued expansion and investments in technology to support our banking operations  including in house processing 
other non interest expenses increased million  or  reflecting the increased volume of business activity  principally increases in lending and growth in deposit accounts 
also  the company has incurred a significant increase in fees paid to outside service providers to assist us in the documentation and testing required for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act sox 
in addition  we incurred a full year of fees paid to service our consumer finance loan portfolio 
during the fourth quarter of  the bank ceased operation of its consumer finance subsidiary 
simultaneously  the bank entered into an agreement with the former president of that subsidiary to service these loans on the behalf of the bank 
on october   the bank and community were merged into a single bank under the bank s name 
in conjunction with this merger  the newly consolidated bank has successfully brought core processing in house 
this function was previously an outsourced service for the bank 
as a consequence of converting the bank s primary operating system  it was necessary to terminate our contract with our previous item processing provider at a cost of  the company believes that the synergies we will achieve by taking these steps will have an immediate and lasting positive impact on our customers as well as our non interest expense provision for income taxes

while the interest rate environment was less volatile in than in recent prior years  we did experience an additional interest rate cut by the federal reserve in june of while this historically low interest rate environment has hampered our asset yields  our growth in interest earning assets combined with lower funding costs resulted in an increase of million in net interest income

fees generated from mortgage originations during and were strong as a result of the increased level of home mortgage refinancings due to the low interest rate environment

the fees paid to service these loans  combined with page severance payments to the former employees and costs associated with the transaction  contributed to the increase in non interest expense 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before income taxes  was for the year ending december  and for the year ended december  liquidity market and public confidence in our financial strength and in the strength of financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity 
this confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital resources 
the term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs for funding loan originations  deposit withdrawals  maturities of borrowings and operating expenses 
management measures our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on and off balance sheet sources of  and demands for  funds on a daily and weekly basis 
sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities  investment securities eligible for pledging to secure borrowings from correspondent banks pursuant to securities sold under repurchase agreements  investments available for sale  loan repayments  loan sales  deposits  and borrowings from the federal home loan bank secured with pledged loans and securities  and from correspondent banks under overnight federal funds credit lines 
in addition to interest rate sensitive deposits  the company s primary demand for liquidity is anticipated funding under credit commitments to customers 
because of our continued growth and the availability of relatively low cost funding sources  we have maintained a relatively high level of liquidity in the form of federal funds sold and investment securities 
these aggregated million at december   compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
supplementing customer deposits as a source of funding  we have available lines of credit from various correspondent banks to purchase federal funds on a short term basis of approximately million 
we also have the credit capacity to borrow up to million  as of december   from the federal home loan bank of atlanta  with million outstanding as of that date 
at december  we had fhlb borrowings outstanding of million 
funding costs have been low during with lower deposit costs due to the core deposit base acquired from community coupled with higher rate certificates of deposit maturing into the lower rate environment and increased use of floating rate funding on both deposits and borrowings 
we also had repurchase agreements with a total outstanding balance of million at december  of this balance  million were done as accommodations for our deposit customers and million were outstanding with our correspondent banks 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within ninety days from the transaction date and are collateralized by us government agency obligations 
we have repurchase lines of credit aggregating million from various institutions 
the repurchases must be adequately collateralized 
at december   our outstanding commitments to extend credit consisted of loan commitments of million and amounts available under home equity credit lines  other credit lines and letters of credit of million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that our combined aggregate liquidity position from all sources is sufficient to meet the funding requirements of loan demand and deposit maturities and withdrawals in the near term 
throughout our eight year history  our loan demand has exceeded our growth in core deposits 
we have therefore relied heavily on certificates of deposits as a source of funds 
while the majority of these funds are from our local market area  the bank has utilized brokered and out of market certificates of deposits to diversify and supplement our deposit base 
certificates of deposits represented of our total deposits at december   a slight increase from at december  brokered and out of market deposits totaled million at year end and million at year end  which comprised and of total deposits  respectively 
certificates of deposit of  or more  inclusive of brokered and out of market certificates  represented of our total deposits at december  and at december  a portion of these deposits are controlled by members of our board of directors and advisory board members  or otherwise come from customers considered to have long standing relationships with our management 
based upon the nature of these relationships  management does not believe we are subject to significant liquidity risk related to these deposits 
large certificates of deposits are generally considered rate sensitive 
while we will need to pay competitive rates to retain these deposits at their maturities  there are other subjective factors that will determine their continued retention 
page contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business there are various outstanding contractual obligations of the company that will require future cash outflows 
in addition  there are commitments and contingent liabilities  such as commitments to extend credit  which may or may not require future cash outflows

as part of its ongoing business  the company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as special purpose entities spes  which generally are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   the company s sole spe activity is with southern community capital trust ii  the subsidiary that issued  trust preferred securities in november capital resources stockholders equity at december  was million 
at that date  our capital to asset ratio was  and all of our capital ratios exceeded the minimums established for a well capitalized bank holding company by regulatory measures 
our tier risk based capital ratio at december  was 
the bank and the company are subject to minimum capital requirements 
see supervision and regulation 
as the following table indicates  at december   the company exceeded its regulatory capital requirements 
at december  actual minimum well capitalized ratio requirement requirement total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio the company s trust preferred securities presently qualify as tier regulatory capital and are reported in federal reserve regulatory reports as a minority interest in our consolidated subsidiaries 
the junior subordinated debentures do not qualify as tier regulatory capital 
the board of governors of the federal reserve  on march   adopted a final rule allowing the continued limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in the tier capital 
the board s final rule limits restricted core capital elements to twenty five percent of all core capital elements 
as of december  the company had a single subsidiary for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities 
in november of  southern community capital trust ii trust ii  a newly formed subsidiary of the company  issued  trust preferred securities trust ii securities  generating total proceeds of million 
the trust ii securities pay distributions at an annual rate of and mature on december  the trust ii securities began paying quarterly distributions on december  the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of trust ii 
the trust ii securities are redeemable in whole or in part at any time after december  the proceeds from the trust ii securities were utilized to purchase convertible junior subordinated debentures from us under the same terms and conditions as the trust ii securities 
we have the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures at any time and from time to time for a period not exceeding five years  provided that no deferral period extend beyond the stated maturities of the debentures 
such deferral of interest payments by the company will result in a deferral of distribution payments on the related trust ii securities 
should we defer the payment of interest on the debentures  the company will be precluded from the payment of cash dividends to shareholders 
the principal use of the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures was to provide cash for the acquisition of the community bank  to increase our regulatory capital  and to support the growth and operations of our subsidiary banks 
the amount of proceeds we count as tier capital cannot comprise more than of our core capital elements 
amounts in excess of that limitation count as tier supplementary capital on our books 
prior to the closing of the acquisition of the community bank on january   substantially all of the proceeds from the trust ii securities qualified as tier supplementary capital 
prior to the redemption of the trust i securities  approximately million of the proceeds of the trust ii securities counted as tier capital on our books 
after the redemption of the trust i securities on march   subject to certain limitations  substantially all of the proceeds from the trust ii securities qualify as tier capital of the company for regulatory capital purposes 
page in february of  southern community capital trust i trust i  a newly formed subsidiary of the company  issued  cumulative convertible trust preferred securities trust i securities  generating total proceeds of million 
at december   holders of the trust i securities had voluntarily converted  of the trust i securities into  shares of our common stock at the conversion price of per share of our common stock 
on january   we announced the redemption of all of the trust i securities 
we redeemed the trust i securities under a provision that permitted us to redeem the trust i securities in whole at any time prior to march  once the trading price of our common stock had been at least of the conversion price for a period of twenty consecutive trading days ending within five days of the date that we gave notice of redemption 
the trust i securities were redeemed on march  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of our common stock through the conversions and the retirement of  of the convertible trust preferred securities 
the trust i securities paid distributions at an annual rate of 
the trust i securities began paying quarterly distributions on march  the company had fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of trust i 
the proceeds from the trust i securities were utilized to purchase convertible junior subordinated debentures from us under the same terms and conditions as the trust i securities 
subject to certain limitations  the trust i securities qualified as tier capital of the company for regulatory capital purposes 
the principal use of the net proceeds from the sale of the convertible debentures was to infuse capital into our bank subsidiary  southern community bank and trust  to fund its operations and continued expansion  and to maintain the company s and the bank s status as well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
asset liability management our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the market place 
the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting earnings from undue interest rate risk  which arises from volatile interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk and capital adequacy 
we adhere to a board approved asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling  monitoring  and reporting exposure to interest rate risk 
our policy is to manage the company s net interest income exposure by measuring the impact of changing interest rate environments and adjusting the mix of assets and liabilities to provide an acceptable return within established risk limits 
net interest income simulation and gap reports in conjunction with other tools are utilized to measure and monitor interest rate risk 
when suitable lending opportunities are not sufficient to utilize available funds  we have generally invested such funds in securities  primarily securities issued by governmental agencies and mortgage backed securities 
the securities portfolio contributes to increased profitability and plays an important part in our overall interest rate risk management 
however  management of the securities portfolio alone cannot balance overall interest rate risk 
the securities portfolio must be used in combination with other asset liability techniques to actively manage the balance sheet 
the primary objectives in the overall management of the securities portfolio are safety  liquidity  yield  asset liability management interest rate risk  and investing in securities that can be pledged for public deposits or for borrowings 
in reviewing the needs of our bank with regard to proper management of its asset liability program  we estimate future needs  taking into consideration investment portfolio purchases  calls and maturities in addition to estimated loan and deposit increases due to increased demand through marketing and forecasted interest rate changes 
we use a number of measures to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including income simulations and gap analyses 
an income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets  cash flows and maturities of other investment securities  loan and deposit volumes and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
based on the results of the income simulation model  as of october   if interest rates increase by two percentage points  our net interest income over a one year time frame could increase by approximately or million 
as of october   if interest rates decrease by one percentage point given the present level of the targeted federal funds rate  our net interest income over a one year time frame could decrease by approximately or million 
the analysis of interest rate gap the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities re pricing or maturing during a given period of time is another standard tool we use to measure exposure to page interest rate risk 
we believe that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance  it should be used in conjunction with other methods of evaluating interest rate risk 
our balance sheet  based on gap measurements  was asset sensitive at december  in the three month horizon and liability sensitive in the one year period 
an asset sensitive position means that there are more assets than liabilities subject to repricing in that period as market rates change  and conversely with a liability sensitive position 
as a result  in a falling rate environment  our earnings position could deteriorate initially followed by improvement  with the opposite expectation in a rising rate environment  depending on the correlation of rate changes in these categories 
the following table presents information about the periods in which the interest sensitive assets and liabilities at december  will either mature or be subject to repricing in accordance with market rates  and the resulting interest sensitivity gaps 
this table shows the sensitivity of the balance sheet at one point in time and is not necessarily indicative of what the sensitivity will be on other dates

these types of deposits historically have not repriced coincidentally with or in the same proportion as general market indicators

this risk of loss can be reflected in diminished current market values and or reduced potential net interest income in future periods 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities 
the structure of our loan and deposit portfolios is such that a significant decline in interest rates may adversely impact net market values and net interest income 
we do not maintain a trading account nor are we subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
interest rate risk is monitored as part of the bank s asset liability management function  which is discussed in asset liability management above

real estate loans 
real estate loans represent our greatest concentration of loans  and are divided into three categories residential mortgage  commercial mortgage  and construction loans 
we make real estate loans for purchasing  constructing and refinancing one to four family residential  five or more family residential and commercial properties 
we also make loans secured by real estate to commercial and individual borrowers who use the loan proceeds for other purposes 
our real estate loans totaled million at december   representing of our total loans outstanding 
our loan policy requires appraisal prior to funding a real estate loan and also outlines the requirements for appraisals on renewals 
we pursue an aggressive policy of evaluation and monitoring on any real estate loan that becomes troubled  including reappraisal when appropriate 
we recognize and reserve for potential exposures as soon as we identify them 
however  the pace of absorption of real properties is affected both by each property s individual nature and characteristics  the status of the real estate market at the time  general economic conditions and other factors that could adversely affect our volume of non performing real estate loans and our ability to dispose of foreclosed properties without loss 
page residential mortgage loans 
we provide our customers access to long term conventional real estate loans through the origination of federal national mortgage association conforming loans 
many of the fixed rate one to four family owner occupied residential mortgage loans that we originate are for sale in the secondary market and have been pre sold for the account of third parties 
residential mortgage loans held for sale totaled million at december  we receive income from residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market  with such fees aggregating  for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we anticipate that we will continue to be an active originator of residential loans for sale to third parties 
residential loans are generated through our in house staff as well as the bank s existing customer base  referrals from real estate agents and builders  and local marketing efforts 
our lending efforts include the origination of loans secured by first mortgages on one to four family residences and on home equity credit lines 
our residential mortgage loans totaled million at december   and included million in one to four family permanent mortgage loans  million in outstanding advances under home equity credit lines  and million of other loans secured by residential real estate 
substantially all of our residential mortgage loans are secured by properties located within our market area  although we will make loans secured by properties outside our market area to qualifying existing customers 
we believe that the amount of risk associated with this group of loans is mitigated in part due to the type of loans involved 
historically  the amount of losses suffered on this type of loan has been significantly less than those loans collateralized by other types of properties 
our one to four family residential loans generally have maturities ranging from to years 
these loans are either fully amortizing with monthly payments sufficient to repay the total amount of the loan or amortizing with a balloon feature  typically due in fifteen years or less 
we review information concerning the income  financial condition  employment history and credit history when evaluating the creditworthiness of an applicant for a residential mortgage loan 
commercial mortgage loans 
our commercial mortgage loans totaled million at december  these loans are secured principally by commercial buildings for office  retail  manufacturing  storage and warehouse properties 
generally in underwriting commercial mortgage loans  we require the personal guaranty of borrowers and a demonstrated cash flow capability sufficient to service the debt 
loans secured by commercial real estate may be in greater amount and involve a greater degree of risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans  and payments on such loans are often dependent on successful operation or management of the properties and the underlying businesses 
we make commercial mortgage loans at both fixed and variable rates for terms generally up to years 
construction loans 
we originate one to four family residential construction loans for the construction of custom homes where the home buyer is the borrower  and we provide construction financing to builders including acquisition development and spec home financing 
we have a staff of lending professionals and assistants who service only our construction loan portfolio 
we generally receive a pre arranged permanent financing commitment from an outside banking entity prior to financing the construction of pre sold homes 
we lend to builders who have demonstrated a favorable record of performance and profitable operations and who are building in our market area 
we also make commercial real estate construction loans  as noted in the preceding paragraph 
we endeavor to limit our construction lending risk through adherence to established underwriting procedures 
also  we generally require documentation of all draw requests and utilize loan officers to inspect the project prior to paying any draw requests from the builder 
with few exceptions  the bank requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment on construction loans 
construction loans aggregated million at december  commercial loans 
commercial business lending is a primary focus of our lending activities 
at december   our commercial loan portfolio equaled million or of total loans 
commercial loans include both secured and unsecured loans for working capital  expansion  and other business purposes 
short term working capital loans generally are secured by accounts receivable  inventory and or equipment 
the bank also makes term commercial loans secured by equipment and real estate 
lending decisions are based on an evaluation of the financial strength  management and credit history of the borrower  and the quality of the collateral securing the loan 
with few exceptions  the bank requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment 
commercial loans generally provide greater yields and re price more frequently than other types of loans  such as real estate loans 
more frequent re pricing means that yields on our commercial loans adjust with changes in interest rates 
loans to individuals 
loans to individuals include automobile loans  boat and recreational vehicle financing and miscellaneous secured and unsecured personal loans 
consumer loans generally can carry significantly greater risks than other loans  even if secured  if the collateral consists of rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles and equipment 
repossessed collateral securing a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the loan 
we attempt to manage the page risks inherent in consumer lending by following established credit guidelines and underwriting practices designed to minimize risk of loss 
loan approvals 
our loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing our lending operations 
generally  the guidelines address the type of loans that we seek  our target markets  underwriting and collateral requirements  terms  interest rate and yield considerations and compliance with laws and regulations 
all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations 
these limitations apply to the borrower s total outstanding indebtedness to us  including the indebtedness of any guarantor 
the policies are reviewed and approved at least annually 
we supplement our supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan audits by independent  outside professionals experienced in loan review work 
individual lending authorities are established by the board of directors as periodically requested by management 
all individual lending authorities are reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors 
the board loan committee consists of the ceo  president  managing evp of commercial lending  svp in charge of credit administration  and five outside directors as appointed by the board of directors 
this committee meets on a monthly basis to review for approval all loan requests in excess of million 
as of december   the legal lending limit for the bank was approximately million 
subsequent to year end  an internal bank committee was formed 
this committee is comprised of seven members whom review all loan requests between million and million 
the board loan committee will review all loan requests in excess of million 
asset quality we consider asset quality to be of primary importance 
we employ a formal internal loan review process to ensure adherence to the lending policy as approved by the board of directors 
it is the responsibility of each lending officer to assign an appropriate risk grade to every loan originated 
credit administration  through the loan review process  validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment 
in addition  as a given loan s credit quality improves or deteriorates  it is credit administration s responsibility to change the borrowers risk grade accordingly 
the function of determining the allowance for loan losses is fundamentally driven by the risk grade system 
as part of the loan review function  we used an independent third party to review the underwriting documentation and risk grading analysis 
in determining the allowance for loan losses and any resulting provision to be charged against earnings  particular emphasis is placed on the results of the loan review process 
we also give consideration to historical loan loss experience  the value and adequacy of collateral  economic conditions in our market area and other factors 
for loans determined to be impaired  the allowance is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the appropriate level of reserve to provide for potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our policy in regard to past due loans normally requires a charge off to the allowance for loan losses within a reasonable period after timely collection efforts and a thorough review has been completed 
further collection efforts are then pursued through various means including legal remedies 
loans carried in a non accrual status are generally collateralized and probable losses are considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
page nonperforming assets the table sets forth  for the period indicated  information about our nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  total nonperforming loans nonaccrual loans plus restructured loans  and total nonperforming assets 
at december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans foreclosed assets total nonperforming assets accruing loans past due days or more allowance for loan losses nonperforming loans to period end loans allowance for loan losses to period end loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans nonperforming assets to total assets our financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on loans  unless we place a loan on nonaccrual basis 
we account for loans on a nonaccrual basis when we have serious doubts about the collectibility of principal or interest 
generally  our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan becomes past due days 
we also place loans on nonaccrual status in cases where we are uncertain whether the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
we record interest on restructured loans at the restructured rates  as collected  when we anticipate that no loss of original principal will occur 
potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing and are not included in nonaccrual or restructured loans above  but about which we have serious doubts as to the borrower s ability to comply with present repayment terms 
these loans are likely to be included later in nonaccrual  past due or restructured loans  therefore they are considered by our management in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
at december   we had identified million of potential problem loans 
had these potential problem loans been placed on non accrual status our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans a would have been at december  at december   we had million of nonaccrual loans 
at that time  the largest nonaccrual balance to any one borrower was  with the average balance for the nonaccrual loans being  real estate owned consists of foreclosed assets  repossessed and idled properties 
at december  real estate owned totaled million or 
of total assets  and consisted of twelve properties 
the largest dollar value of a property is  we have reviewed recent appraisals of these properties and believe that the fair value  less estimated costs to sell  exceed their carrying value 
page analysis of allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by provisions charged to operations and by recoveries of amounts previously charged off  and we reduce our allowance by loans charged off 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance at least quarterly 
in addition  on a monthly basis our board loan committee reviews our loan portfolio and conducts an evaluation of our credit quality 
the board loan committee reports directly to board of directors 
quarterly the board of directors reviews the loan loss provision 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance  we consider the growth  composition and industry diversification of the portfolio  historical loan loss experience  current delinquency levels  trends in past dues and classified assets  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors deriving from our limited history of operations 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to make adjustments for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of our management 
we use our risk grading program  as described under asset quality  to facilitate our evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in this program  risk grades are initially assigned by loan officers  reviewed by credit administration  and tested by our internal auditors  internal loan review and by an independent third party 
the testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans  large loans  loans that are identified as having potential credit weaknesses  loans past due days or more  and nonaccrual loans 
we strive to maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of our market area 
every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies 
we have no foreign loans and we do not engage in lease financing or highly leveraged transactions 
we follow a loan review program designed to evaluate the credit risk in our loan portfolio 
through this loan review process  we maintain an internally classified watch list that helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets  management considers  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the borrower s ability to repay  the borrower s payment history and the current status 
as a result of this process  certain loans are categorized as substandard  doubtful or loss and reserves are allocated based on management s judgment  objective criteria and historical experience 
loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some losses or the borrower may default if the deficiencies are not corrected 
a reserve of up to is generally allocated to each of these loans 
loans classified as doubtful are those loans that have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and default is likely 
a reserve of is generally allocated to loans classified as doubtful 
loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted 
this classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future 
as a practical matter  when loans are identified as loss they are charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the above classification categories  we also categorize loans based upon risk grade and loan type  assigning an allowance allocation based upon each category 
growth in loans outstanding has  throughout our history  been the primary reason for increases in our allowance for loan losses and the resultant provisions for loan losses necessary to provide for those increases 
this growth has been spread among our major loan categories  with the concentrations of major loan categories being relatively consistent in recent years 
for all full fiscal years through  our loan loss experience was similar to that of other new banks  with net loan charge offs in each year of less than 
of average loans outstanding 
net charge offs increased  in to million 
however  due to our expanded loan base as a result of the community transaction  the percentage of net loan charge offs to average loans outstanding decreased to 
for the year ended december   from 
for the year ended our consumer finance lending accounted for  or of net charge offs during  a decrease of  from the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of the bank ceased the consumer finance operations 
it is expected that the residual consumer finance loan portfolio will payoff over a twenty four month time frame and the company s level of charge off as a percentage of loan outstandings will decline as a result 
our provision for loan losses totaled million for the year ended december  our allowance for loan losses at december  of million represents of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
our allowance for loan losses at december  was million and represented of total loans 
page the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business 
we make specific allowances that are allocated to certain individual loans and pools of loans based on risk characteristics  as discussed below 
in addition to the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses  we maintain an unallocated portion that is not assigned to any specific category of loans 
this unallocated portion is intended to reserve for the inherent risk in the portfolio and the intrinsic inaccuracies associated with the estimation of the allowance for loan losses and its allocation to specific loan categories 
while management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
furthermore  while we believe we have established the allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing our portfolio  will not require adjustments to our allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed herein 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
while net loan charge offs to average loans experienced improvement in  nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans and nonperforming assets to total assets have increased basis points and basis points  respectively  from year end in addition  potential problem loans  as described under asset quality  have increased million from december levels to million 
the unfavorable trends in nonperforming loans and assets coupled with deterioration in previously disclosed impaired loans and continued evaluation of community s loan portfolio has cautioned management to maintain the allowance for loan losses to total loans at a level above that of specific reserves have been established for certain problem loans and management continuously monitors our asset quality 
as potential problem credit issues are resolved  as our nonperforming trends improve and as management further evaluates the asset quality of the community loan portfolio  the allowance will be adjusted to reflect those changes 
page the following table describes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories of loans and certain other information for the dates indicated

the securities portfolio generates a substantial percentage of our interest income and serves as a necessary source of liquidity 
management attempts to deploy investable funds into instruments that are expected to increase the overall return of the portfolio given the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  while maintaining acceptable levels of capital  and interest rate and liquidity risk

page derivative financial instruments a derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows  and therefore its value  by reference to an underlying instrument  index or reference rate 
these instruments primarily consist of interest rate swaps  caps  floors  financial forward and futures contracts and options written or purchased 
derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as notional amounts 
notional amounts only provide the basis for calculating payments between counterparties and do not represent amounts to be exchanged between parties and are not a measure of financial risks 
credit risk arises when amounts receivable from a counterparty exceed amounts payable 
we control our risk of loss on derivative contracts by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit 
we have also used interest rate swaps in the management of interest rate risk 
interest rate swaps are contractual agreements between two parties to exchange a series of cash flows representing interest payments 
a swap allows both parties to alter the repricing characteristics of assets or liabilities without affecting the underlying principal positions 
through the use of a swap  assets and liabilities may be transformed from fixed to floating rates  from floating rates to fixed rates  or from one type of floating rate to another 
at december   swap derivatives with a total notional value of million  with terms ranging up to twenty nine years  were outstanding 
although off balance sheet derivative financial instruments do not expose the company to credit risk equal to the notional amount  such agreements generate credit risk to the extent of the fair value gain in an off balance sheet derivative financial instrument if the counterparty fails to perform 
such risk is minimized through the creditworthiness of the counterparties and the consistent monitoring of these agreements 
the counterparties to these arrangements were primarily large commercial banks and investment banks 
where appropriate  master netting agreements are arranged or collateral is obtained in the form of rights to securities 
at december   our interest rate swaps reflected a net unrealized loss of  in addition  the bank liquidated two interest rate swap contracts in order to effectively lock in its hedged position 
the bank realized gains of million on the liquidation of these contracts  which are being amortized into income over the remaining lives of the original contract terms 
other risks associated with interest sensitive derivatives include the effect on fixed rate positions during periods of changing interest rates 
indexed amortizing swaps notional amounts and maturities change based on certain interest rate indices 
generally  as rates fall the notional amounts decline more rapidly  and as rates increase notional amounts decline more slowly 
at december   we had no indexed amortizing swaps outstanding 
under unusual circumstances  financial derivatives also increase liquidity risk  which could result from an environment of rising interest rates in which derivatives produce negative cash flows while being offset by increased cash flows from variable rate loans 
such risk is considered insignificant due to the relatively small derivative positions we hold 
a discussion of derivatives is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements  which are presented under item in this form k 
sources of funds deposit activities we provide a range of deposit services  including non interest bearing checking accounts  interest bearing checking and savings accounts  money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
these accounts generally earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and our desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits 
we have used brokered deposits and out of market deposits as funding sources 
as of december   we have million of brokered deposits and million of out of market deposits
