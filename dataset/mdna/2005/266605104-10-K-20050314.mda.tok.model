overview we are an emerging specialty pharmaceuticals systems company focused on the development of pharmaceutical systems based on the following proprietary drug delivery technology platforms the saber delivery system a patented and versatile depot injectable useful for protein and small molecule delivery  the transdur delivery system a proprietary transdermal technology  the oradur sustained release oral gel cap technology an oral sustained release technology with several potential abuse deterrent properties  the durin biodegradable implant a biodegradable drug loaded implant  the duros system  an osmotic implant technology licensed to us for specified fields from alza corporation  a johnson johnson company and the microdur biodegradable microparticulates a microspheres injectable system 
collaborative agreements in order to rapidly identify and fund additional product opportunities  we may enter into agreements with various companies who wish to explore the feasibility of combining their drugs with our drug delivery technologies to develop product candidates 
in addition  we may enter into agreements with companies who wish to collaborate on the development and commercialization of our existing product candidates in development 
to date  we have entered into such arrangements with pain therapeutics  voyager  endo and neurosystec 
under these collaborative agreements  we perform research and development activities to develop product candidates utilizing our drug delivery technologies and recognize collaborative research and development revenue on reimbursement payments of expenses and milestone payments from our collaborators 
depending on the agreement  we may also have royalty  distribution  or other rights once product candidates are commercialized under the agreement 
in  revenues from our collaborative agreements with pain therapeutics and voyager represented and of our total revenues 
in  revenues from our collaborative agreements with pain therapeutics and voyager represented and of our total revenues 
product revenues we currently generate product revenue from the sale of two product lines alzet osmotic pumps for animal research use  and lactel biodegradable polymers which are used by our customers as raw materials in their pharmaceutical and medical products 
this product line was sold through our wholly owned subsidiary api until it was merged with and into us as of december  
table of contents because we consider our core business to be developing and commercializing pharmaceutical systems  we do not intend to significantly increase our investments in or efforts to sell or market any of our existing product lines 
however  we expect that we will continue to make efforts to increase our revenue related to collaborative research and development by entering into additional research and development agreements with third party partners to develop product candidates based on our drug delivery technologies 
since our inception in  we have had a history of operating losses 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and our net losses were million  million and million for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
these losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred to research and develop our product candidates and to a lesser extent  from selling  general and administrative costs associated with our operations and product sales 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase modestly in the near future as we expect to continue to expand our animal studies  clinical trials and other research and development activities 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase modestly in the near future in light of the additional cost of corporate governance requirements 
we also expect to incur additional non cash expenses relating to amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation 
we do not anticipate revenues from our pharmaceutical systems  should they be approved  for at least several years 
therefore  we expect to incur continuing losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  accrued liabilities and contract research liabilities 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time the product is shipped and title transfers to customers  provided no continuing obligation exists and the collectibility of the amounts owed is reasonably assured 
incorrect assumptions at the time of sale about our customers ability to pay could result in an overstatement of revenue 
revenue related to research and development with our collaborators is recognized as the related research and development services are performed over the related funding periods for each agreement 
the payments received under each respective agreement are not refundable and are generally based on reimbursement of qualified expenses  as defined in the agreements 
research and development expenses under the collaborative and development research agreements approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result when we do not expend the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective agreement 
milestone and royalties payments  if any  are recognized as earned 
incorrect determination of qualified expenses could result in greater or lesser revenue being recorded 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts  such as other contract research and development revenue  is recognized only to the extent of reimbursable costs incurred plus estimated fees thereon 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only after a signed agreement is in place 
for contracts that have a ceiling price or contract value  losses on contracts are recognized in the period in which the losses become known and estimable 
incorrect estimates as to 
table of contents percentage of completion or losses expected to be incurred could result in greater or lesser revenues or losses being recorded 
intangible assets and goodwill we record intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets such as completed or core technology are amortized over time  while acquired in process research and development is recorded as a one time charge on the acquisition date 
acquired in process research and development represents the value of research projects in process at the time of acquisition which have not yet reached technological feasibility  and which have no alternative future use 
the determination of the amount of acquired in process research and development involves several estimates and judgments  including the percentage of completion of the in process technology and assumptions about future cash flows to be derived from the technology and discount rates 
different assumptions employed in determining the value of in process research and development could result in a greater or lesser amount being recorded 
as of january   goodwill is not amortized to expense but rather periodically assessed for impairment 
the allocation of the cost of an acquisition to intangible assets and goodwill therefore has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of those intangible assets subject to amortization  which determines the amount of amortization that will be recorded in a given future period and how quickly the total balance will be amortized 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the amount of any impairment charge is significantly impacted by and highly dependent upon assumptions as to future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate 
management believes that the discount rate used in this analysis is reasonable in light of currently available information 
the use of different assumptions or discount rates could result in a materially different impairment charge 
in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas became effective 
as a result  we ceased amortizing approximately million of goodwill and assembled workforce 
in lieu of amortization  we perform a review for impairment at least annually 
no impairment of goodwill has been recorded through december  however  there can be no assurance that at the time other periodic reviews are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 

table of contents accrued liabilities and contract research liabilities we incur significant costs associated with third party consultants and organizations for clinical trials  engineering  validation  testing  and other research and development related services 
we are required to estimate periodically the cost of services rendered but unbilled based on managements estimates of project status 
if these good faith estimates are inaccurate  actual expenses incurred could materially differ from our estimates 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item of our form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
total revenues were million in compared to million in the increase in total revenue was primarily attributable to higher collaborative research and development and milestone revenue recognized from our agreements with pain therapeutics  voyager pharmaceutical corporation and other strategic partners 
a portion of our revenues is derived from our product sales  which include our alzet mini pump product line  and to a lesser extent our polymer products and ear catheter products 
net product revenues were million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to a lower product revenue from our alzet mini pump product line in  partially offset by higher polymer revenue from our api biodegradable polymer product line 
we ceased selling intraear catheter products in september due to a change in business strategic focus 
intraear products comprised zero and  of net product revenue in and  respectively 
we also recognize revenues from collaborative research and development activities  service contracts and to a lesser extent license activities 
we recorded million of collaborative research and development and milestone revenue in compared to million in collaborative research and development and milestone revenue represents reimbursement of qualified expenses related to the collaborative agreements with various third parties to research  develop and commercialize potential product candidates using our drug delivery technologies and milestone payments upon achieving certain regulatory milestones under the collaboration agreements 
the increase in collaborative research and development revenue in was primarily attributable to our increased development activities for remoxy collaboration with pain therapeutics and durin based alzheimer s disease product collaboration with voyager compared with we recognized million of milestone revenue in under the collaboration agreements with pain therapeutics and voyager compared with none in we expect our collaborative research and development revenue to increase in the future years as we continue to increase our effort to develop partnered products with various strategic partners

cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased to million in from million in cost of revenue includes cost of product revenue and cost of contract services provided by us 
the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to increased cost of service revenue related to api service contracts in cost of revenue associated with the product revenue was million in both and in cost of other revenue from service contracts increased to  in from  in due to higher manufacturing costs for additional service contracts we performed for api customers in as of december   we had manufacturing employees compared with as of the corresponding date in we expect cost of revenue to remain comparable in the future  as we do not expect product revenues and service contract revenues to increase significantly in the future 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to higher development costs related to our saber post operative pain product candidate  transdermal sufentanil pain product candidate  chronogesic and other partnered product candidates in development 
as of december   we had research and development employees compared with as of the corresponding date in we expect research and development expenses to increase in the near future as we continue to conduct clinical trials and toxicological studies for our saber post operative pain depot product candidate and transdermal sufentanil pain product candidate and continue product development efforts for other internal and partnered product candidates 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase primarily resulted from higher internal and external expenses to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of approximately  as of december   we had selling  general and administrative personnel compared with as of the corresponding date in we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase modestly in the near future in light of the additional cost of corporate governance requirements 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million in compared with million in the amortization of intangible assets decreased in as certain intangible assets were fully amortized in the quarter ended june  in and  goodwill was evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas based on our evaluation  no indicators of impairment were noted 
should goodwill become impaired in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write the goodwill down to its estimated fair value 
the net amount of intangible assets at december  was million  which will be amortized as follows million in the year of   in the year   in each of the years  and  and  in the year should other intangible assets become impaired  the company will write them down to their estimated fair values 
stock based compensation 
since inception  we have recorded aggregate deferred compensation charges of million in connection with stock options granted to employees and directors  including  that we recorded at the time of our acquisition of southern biosystems  inc sbs in april for the assumption of outstanding unvested stock options granted to employees and directors of that company 
of the total amount  we have amortized or reversed due to employee terminations approximately million through december  employee stock based compensation expense  net of reversal  was  in and  in of these amounts  employee stock compensation related to the following cost of revenue of  in 
table of contents and  in  research and development expenses of  in and  in  and selling  general and administrative expenses of  in and  in total stock compensation expense related to modification of stock option terms was  in and  in total non employee stock compensation was  in and  in of these amounts  non employee stock compensation related to the following research and development expenses of  in and  in and selling  general and administrative expenses of  in and none in expenses for non employee stock options are recorded over the vesting period of the options  with the amount determined by the black scholes option valuation method and remeasured over the vesting term 
the remaining deferred employee stock compensation at december  was  which will be amortized as follows  in and  in termination of employment of option holders could cause stock based compensation in future years to be less than indicated 
other income expense 
interest income increased to million in from million in the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to higher yields on cash and debt security investments 
we expect interest income to decline as our average outstanding investment balances decline 
the increase in interest expense to million for from million for was primarily due to interest expense incurred on the million of convertible subordinated notes issued in june and july we expect interest expense to remain comparable in the near future as we continue to make interest payments on our convertible notes and to amortize the issuance costs to interest expenses 
income taxes 
income tax provision was  in due to state income taxes paid for api in compared with zero in prior to  we had no provision for income taxes  as we incurred losses for all periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through and federal research and development tax credits of approximately million  which expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purpose of approximately million  which expire in the years through and state research and development tax credits of approximately million  which do not expire 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to federal and state ownership change limitations 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
as of december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million 
deferred tax assets reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance

cost of revenue 
cost of revenue decreased to million in from million in cost of revenue includes cost of product revenue and to a lesser extent  cost of contract services provided by us 
the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies achieved in our alzet product line

research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to the lower development costs related to chronogesic  offset by a slight increase in research and development expenses for our post operative pain product and other direct expenses incurred under our collaborative agreements 
the decrease in the research and development expenses also resulted from lower personnel expenses in compared with the same period of in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our research and development workforce in order to conserve capital following the discontinuation of our pivotal phase iii clinical trial for chronogesic 
as of december   we had research and development employees compared with as of the corresponding date in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to effective cost controls in the existing corporate infrastructure in and a one time expense of million for strategic partner advisory services in connection with the endo agreement  which was executed in the fourth quarter of as of december   we had selling  general and administrative personnel compared with as of the corresponding date in amortization of intangible assets

in  cash received from financing activities was primarily due to proceeds from exercises of stock options and purchases of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  offset by payments on a term loan and long term debt 
in  cash received from financing activities was primarily due to the net proceeds from our million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
in  cash received related primarily to million of proceeds from the sale of stock to endo pharmaceutical  a collaborative partner 
in august  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  valued at  at the first anniversary of the closing of the merger to former shareholders of absorbable polymers technologies  inc apt pursuant to the merger agreement signed in august in june and july  we completed a private placement of an aggregate of million in convertible subordinated notes 
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum and are due on june  the notes are convertible at the option of the note holders into our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears in june and december 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting fees of million and related expenses of  the convertible subordinated notes are unsecured obligation of ours and are subordinate to any secured debt we currently have or any future senior debt we may have 
the proceeds from the convertible notes will be used to fund the research  development  manufacture and commercialization of existing and future products and for general corporate purpose  including working capital and capital expenditures 
in conjunction with the acquisition of sbs in april  we assumed the sbs bonds with remaining principal payments of million and a current interest rate of increasing each year up to at maturity on november  as part of the acquisition agreement  we were required to guarantee and collateralize these bonds with a letter of credit of approximately million that we secured with investments deposited with a financial institution in july interest payments are due semi annually and principal payments are due annually 
principal payments increase in annual increments from  to  over the term of the bonds until the principal is fully amortized in we have an option to call the sbs bonds at any time 
on december   sbs was merged into durect  and the sbs bonds were assigned to durect with the terms unchanged 
at december   the remaining principal payments of the bonds were million 
we anticipate that cash used in operating activities will slightly decrease in the near future as we continue to research  develop  and manufacture our products through partnering activities and internal efforts  and service 
table of contents our debt obligations 
in aggregate  we are required to make future payments pursuant to our existing contractual obligations as follows contractual obligations total convertible subordinated notes long term debt term loan apt acquisition consideration payable capital lease operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations note includes principal and interest payments note to be paid in our common stock or cash at our election we also anticipate incurring capital expenditures of at least million over the next months to purchase research and development and manufacturing equipment 
the amount and timing of these capital expenditures will depend  among other things  on the success of clinical trials for our products and our collaborative research and development activities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our planned operations  existing debt and contractual commitments  and planned capital expenditures through at least months 
we may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated  resulting in the need for additional funding 
additionally  we do not expect to generate revenues from our pharmaceutical systems currently under development for at least the next several years  if at all 
accordingly  we may be required to raise additional capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private equity financing  collaborative arrangements  and public or private debt 
there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
we have not utilized and do not intend to utilize off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  hedging and derivative strategies  or other complex financial techniques to fund our operations or otherwise manage our financial position 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the issue s objective is to provide guidance for identifying other than temporarily impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp eitf that delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf until further notice 
the disclosure requirements of eitf are effective with this annual report for fiscal once the fasb reaches a final decision on the measurement and recognition provisions  the company will evaluate the impact of the adoption of the accounting provisions of eitf in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  or fas r  share based payment  effective for annual or interim periods beginning after june  fas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and will require companies to recognize compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to share based payments including stock options and stock issued under our employee stock purchase plans 
we will be required to implement fas r no later than the quarter that begins july  our adoption will be applied on a modified prospective basis and measured compensation expense will be recognized commencing on july  we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of fas r  and therefore cannot estimate the impact of our adoption at this time 
these methodologies and assumptions may be different than those currently employed by the company in applying fas  outlined above in stock based compensation section of this note 
we expect that our adoption of fas r will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position

table of contents factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this form k  a number of factors may affect our business and prospects 
these factors include but are not limited to the following  which you should consider carefully in evaluating our business and prospects 
we have not completed development of any of our pharmaceutical systems  and we cannot be certain that our pharmaceutical systems will be able to be commercialized to be profitable  we must successfully research  develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market and distribute our pharmaceutical systems under development 
for each pharmaceutical system that we or our third party collaborators intend to commercialize  we must successfully meet a number of critical developmental milestones for each disease or medical condition targeted  including selecting and developing drug delivery platform technology to deliver the proper dose of drug over the desired period of time  determining the appropriate drug dosage for use in the pharmaceutical system  developing drug compound formulations that will be tolerated  safe and effective and that will be compatible with the system  demonstrating the drug formulation will be stable for commercially reasonable time periods  selecting and developing catheter or other targeting technology  if appropriate  to deliver the drug to a specific location within the body  and demonstrating through clinical trials that the drug and system combination is safe and effective in patients for the intended indication 
the time frame necessary to achieve these developmental milestones for any individual product candidate is long and uncertain  and we may not successfully complete these milestones for any of our product candidates in development 
we have not yet selected the drug dosages nor finalized the formulation or the system design of any pharmaceutical systems  including our saber based post operative pain depot  our transdur sufentanil patch  remoxy  our durin based alzheimer s disease product candidate and our chronogesic product candidate  and durect has limited experience in developing such products 
we may not be able to finalize the design or formulation of any of our product candidates 
in addition  we may select components  solvents  excipients or other ingredients to include in our pharmaceutical systems that have not been previously approved for use in pharmaceutical products  which may require us to perform additional studies and may delay clinical testing and regulatory approval of our pharmaceutical systems 
even after we complete the design of the product candidate  the product candidate must still complete required clinical trials and additional safety testing in animals before approval for commercialization 
see we must conduct and satisfactorily complete required laboratory performance and safety testing  animal studies and clinical trials for our pharmaceutical systems before we can sell them 
we are continuing testing and development of our product candidates and may explore possible design or formulation changes to address issues of safety  manufacturing efficiency and performance 
we may not be able to complete development of any product candidates that will be safe and effective and that will have a commercially reasonable treatment and storage period 
if we are unable to complete development of our saber based post operative pain depot product candidate  our transdur sufentanil patch  remoxy  our durin based alzheimer s disease product candidate  chronogesic or other product candidates  we will not be able to earn revenue from them  which would materially harm our business 
we must conduct and satisfactorily complete required laboratory performance and safety testing  animal studies and clinical trials for our pharmaceutical systems before they can be sold before we can obtain government approval to sell any of our pharmaceutical systems  we must demonstrate through laboratory performance studies and safety testing  preclinical animal studies and clinical human trials 
table of contents that each system is safe and effective for human use for each targeted disease 
the clinical development status of our most advanced programs is as follows saber bupivacaine phase i trial completed and phase ii trial initiated

redesigning the system to address premature shutdown problem and will resume clinical trials when system design is completed 
we are currently in the preclinical or research stages with respect to all our other product candidates under development 
we plan to continue extensive and costly tests  clinical trials and safety studies in animals to assess the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates 
these studies include laboratory performance studies and safety testing  clinical trials and animal toxicological studies necessary to support regulatory approval of product candidates in the united states and other countries of the world 
these studies are costly  complex and last for long durations  and may not yield the data required for regulatory approval 
we may not be permitted to begin or continue our planned clinical trials for our potential product candidates 
if our trials are permitted  our potential product candidates may not prove to be safe or produce their intended effects 
in addition  we may be required by regulatory agencies to conduct additional animal or human studies regarding the safety and efficacy of our product candidates which we have not planned or anticipated that could delay commercialization of such product candidates and harm our business and financial conditions 
the length of our clinical trials will depend upon  among other factors  the rate of trial site and patient enrollment and the number of patients required to be enrolled in such studies 
we may fail to obtain adequate levels of patient enrollment in our clinical trials 
delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs  delays or termination of clinical trials  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  even if we enroll the number of patients we expect in the time frame we expect  our clinical trials may not provide the data necessary to support regulatory approval for the product candidates for which they were conducted 
additionally  we may fail to effectively oversee and monitor these clinical trials  which would result in increased costs or delays of our clinical trials 
even if these clinical trials are completed  we may fail to complete and submit a new drug application as scheduled 
even if we are able to submit a new drug application as scheduled  the food and drug administration may not clear our application in a timely manner or may deny the application entirely 
data already obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials of our pharmaceutical systems do not necessarily predict the results that will be obtained from later preclinical studies and clinical trials 
moreover  preclinical and clinical data such as ours is susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
the failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product candidate under development could delay or prevent regulatory clearance of the potential product candidate  resulting in delays to the commercialization of our product candidates  and could materially harm our business 
our clinical trials may not demonstrate the sufficient levels of safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and thus our product candidates may not be approved for marketing 

table of contents we and our third party collaborators may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products and components to support the clinical and commercial requirements of our collaborators and ourselves at an acceptable cost  and we have limited manufacturing experience we or our third party collaborators to whom we have assigned such responsibility must manufacture our product candidates and components in clinical and commercial quantities  either directly or through third parties  in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost 
the manufacture processes associated with our pharmaceutical systems are complex 
we and our third party collaborators  where relevant  have not yet completed development of the manufacturing process for any product candidates or components including our saber based post operative pain depot  our transdur sufentanil patch product candidate  remoxy  our durin based alzheimer s disease product candidate and our chronogesic product candidate 
if we and our third party collaborators  where relevant  fail to timely complete the development of the manufacturing process for our product candidates  we and our third party collaborators  where relevant  will not be able to timely produce product for clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates 
in the future  we will continue to consider ways to optimize our manufacturing process and to explore possible changes to improve product performance and quality  increase efficiencies and lower costs 
we have also committed to manufacture and supply product or components under a number of our collaborative agreements with third party companies 
we have limited experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products  and we may not be able to timely accomplish these tasks 
if we and our third party collaborators  where relevant  fail to develop manufacturing processes to permit us to manufacture a product candidate or component at an acceptable cost  then we and our third party partners may not be able to commercialize that product candidate or we may be in breach of our supply obligations to our third party partners 
our manufacturing facility in cupertino is a functional multi discipline site that we have used to manufacture research and clinical supplies of several of our pharmaceutical system product candidates under gmp  including saber bupivacaine  transdur sufentanil  remoxy and chronogesic 
we have recently made significant site improvements and equipment installations to upgrade and expand our manufacturing capabilities 
in the future  we intend to develop additional manufacturing capabilities for our pharmaceutical systems and components to meet our demands and those of our third party collaborators by contracting with third party manufacturers and by construction of additional manufacturing space at our current facilities in cupertino  ca and pelham  al 
we have limited experience building and validating manufacturing facilities  and we may not be able to timely accomplish these tasks 
in order to manufacture clinical and commercial supplies of our pharmaceutical systems or components for our third party collaborators or ourselves  we must attain and maintain compliance with applicable federal  state and foreign regulatory standards relating to manufacture of pharmaceutical products which are rigorous  complex and subject to varying interpretations 
furthermore  our facilities will be subject to government audits to determine compliance with good manufacturing practices regulations  and we may be unable to pass inspection with the applicable regulatory agencies or may be asked to undertake corrective measures which may be costly and cause delay 
if we and our third party collaborators  where relevant  are unable to manufacture product or components in a timely manner or at an acceptable cost  quality or performance level  and attain and maintain compliance with applicable regulations  the clinical trials and the commercial sale of our pharmaceutical systems and those of our third party partners could be delayed 
additionally  we may need to alter our facility design or manufacturing processes  install additional equipment or do additional construction or testing in order to meet regulatory requirements  optimize the production process  increase efficiencies or production capacity or for other reasons  which may result in additional cost to us or delay production of product needed for the clinical trials and commercial launch of our product candidates and those of our third party collaborators 
we and our third party collaborators  where relevant  may also need or choose to subcontract with third party contractors to perform manufacturing steps of our pharmaceutical systems or supply required components for our pharmaceutical systems in which case we will be subject to the schedule  expertise and performance of third parties as well as incur significant additional costs 
see we rely heavily on third parties to support development  clinical testing and manufacturing of our product candidates and key components of our pharmaceutical systems are provided 
table of contents by limited numbers of suppliers  and supply shortages or loss of these suppliers could result in interruptions in supply or increased costs 
under our development and commercialization agreement with alza  we cannot subcontract the manufacture of subassemblies of the duros system components of our duros based pharmaceutical system product candidates to third parties which have not been approved by alza 
if we cannot manufacture product or components in time to meet the clinical or commercial requirements of our partners or ourselves or at an acceptable cost  our operating results will be harmed 
in april  we acquired the alzet product and related assets from alza 
we manufacture subassemblies of the alzet product at our vacaville facility 
we currently rely on a third party  to perform the coating process for the manufacture of the alzet product under a contract that expires in january failure to obtain product approvals or comply with ongoing governmental regulations could delay or limit introduction of our product candidates and result in failure to achieve anticipated revenues the manufacture and marketing of our product candidates and our research and development activities are subject to extensive regulation for safety  efficacy and quality by numerous government authorities in the united states and abroad 
we must obtain clearance or approval from applicable regulatory authorities before we can market or sell our product candidates in the us or abroad 
before receiving approval or clearance to market a product in the us or in any other country  we will have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory agencies that the product is safe and effective on the patient population and for the diseases that will be treated 
clinical trials  manufacturing and marketing of products are subject to the rigorous testing and approval process of the fda and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and other federal  state and foreign statutes and regulations govern and influence the testing  manufacture  labeling  advertising  distribution and promotion of drugs and medical devices 
these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
furthermore  these laws and regulations may be subject to varying interpretations  and we may not be able to predict how an applicable regulatory body or agency may choose to interpret or apply any law or regulation 
as a result  clinical trials and regulatory approval can take a number of years to accomplish and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
we may encounter delays or rejections based upon administrative action or interpretations of current rules and regulations 
we may not be able to timely reach agreement with the fda on our clinical trial protocols or on the required data we must collect to continue with our clinical trials or eventually commercialize our product candidates 
we may also encounter delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation  administrative action or changes in fda policy during the period of product development  clinical trials and fda regulatory review 
we may encounter similar delays in foreign countries 
sales of our product candidates outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory standards that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be shorter or longer than that required for fda approval  and requirements for foreign licensing may differ from fda requirements 
we may be unable to obtain requisite approvals from the fda and foreign regulatory authorities  and even if obtained  such approvals may not be on a timely basis  or they may not cover the clinical uses that we specify 
if we fail to obtain timely clearance or approval for our product candidates  we will not be able to market and sell our product candidates  which will limit our ability to generate revenue 
marketing or promoting a drug is subject to very strict controls 
furthermore  clearance or approval may entail ongoing requirements for post marketing studies 
the manufacture and marketing of drugs are subject to continuing fda and foreign regulatory review and requirements that we update our regulatory filings 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility  or our failure to update regulatory files  may result in restrictions  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
any of the following events  if they were to occur  could delay or preclude us from further developing  marketing or realizing full commercial use of our product candidates  which in turn would materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations failure to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals  
table of contents failure to obtain approvals for clinically intended uses of our product candidates under development  or identification of serious and unanticipated adverse side effects in our product candidates under development 
manufacturers of drugs also must comply with the applicable fda good manufacturing practice regulations  which include production design controls  testing  quality control and quality assurance requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations is difficult and costly 
manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspection by the fda and corresponding state agencies  including unannounced inspections  and must be licensed before they can be used for the commercial manufacture of our product candidates 
we and or our present or future suppliers and distributors may be unable to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practice regulations and other fda regulatory requirements 
we have not been subject to a good manufacturing regulation inspection by the fda relating to our pharmaceutical systems 
if we do not achieve compliance for the product candidates we manufacture  the fda may refuse or withdraw marketing clearance or require product recall  which may cause interruptions or delays in the manufacture and sale of our product candidates 
our near term revenues depend on collaborations agreements with other companies 
these agreements subject us to obligations which must be fulfilled and require us to manage complex relationships with third parties 
if we are unable to meet our obligations or manage our relationships with our collaborators under these agreements or enter into additional collaboration agreements or if our existing collaborations are terminated  our revenues may decrease our near term revenues are based to a significant extent on collaborative arrangements with third parties  pursuant to which we receive payments based on our performance of research and development activities and the attainment of milestones set forth in the agreements 
we may not be able to fulfill our obligations or attain milestones set forth in any specific agreement  which could cause our revenues to fluctuate or be less than anticipated and may expose us to liability for contractual breach 
in addition  these agreements may require us to devote significant time and resources to communicating with and managing our relationship with such collaborators and resolving possible issues of contractual interpretation which may detract from time our management would otherwise devote to our managing our operations 
in general  our collaboration agreements  including our agreements with endo with respect to chronogesic and transdur sufentanil  pain therapeutics  voyager and neurosystec  may be terminated by the other party at will or upon specified conditions including  for example  if we fail to satisfy specified performance milestones or if we breach the terms of the agreement 
our agreement with endo for the development and commercialization of our chronogesic product candidate in the us and canada can be terminated by endo starting in january in the event we have not commenced a specified clinical trial for the chronogesic product candidate by january  provided that endo provides us written notice of termination prior to january  if any of our collaborative agreements are terminated  our revenues will be reduced and our product candidates related to those agreements may not be commercialized 
we do not have or have limited control over the development  sales and distribution for our product candidates which are the subject of third party collaborative or license agreements we have yet to establish any marketing  sales or distribution capabilities for our pharmaceutical system product candidates  and therefore are dependent on such third party companies to market  sell and distribute such product candidates 
we have entered into agreements with endo related to the promotion and distribution of our chronogesic and transdur sufentanil product candidates in the us and canada once such products are approved for commercialization 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with endo  pain therapeutics  voyager and neurosystec under which we granted such third parties the right to develop  apply for regulatory approval for  market  promote or distribute the resulting developed products subject to payments to us in the form 
table of contents of product royalties and other payments 
see item business durect strategy 
we have limited or no control over the expertise or resources that any collaborator may devote to the development  marketing or sale of these product candidates  or the timing of their activities 
any of our present or future collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected 
these collaborators may breach or terminate their agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner 
further  our collaborators may elect not to develop or commercialize products arising out of our collaborative arrangements or not devote sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  marketing or sale of these products 
if any of these events occur  we may not be able to develop our technologies or recognize revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates based on such collaborations 
in addition  these third parties may have similar or competitive products to the ones which are the subject of their collaborations with us  or relationships with our competitors  which may reduce their interest in developing or selling our product candidates 
we and our third party collaborators compete with many other companies that currently have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations 
our marketing and sales efforts and those of our third party collaborations may be unable to compete successfully against these other companies 
we and our third party collaborators  if relevant  may be unable to establish a sufficient sales and marketing organization on a timely basis  if at all 
we and our third party collaborators  if relevant  may be unable to engage qualified distributors 
even if engaged  these distributors may fail to satisfy financial or contractual obligations to us  fail to adequately market our products  cease operations with little or no notice to us  offer  design  manufacture or promote competing product lines  fail to maintain adequate inventory and thereby restrict use of our products  or build up inventory in excess of demand thereby limiting future purchases or our products resulting in significant quarter to quarter variability in our sales 
the failure of us or our third party collaborators to effectively develop  gain regulatory approval for sell and market our products will hurt our business and financial results 
we rely heavily on third parties to support development  clinical testing and manufacturing of our product candidates we rely on third party contract research organizations  service providers and suppliers to provide critical services to support development  clinical testing  and manufacturing of our pharmaceutical systems 
for example  we currently depend on third party vendors to manage and monitor our clinical trials and to perform critical manufacturing steps for our pharmaceutical systems 
in the past  we relied on a third party contract manufacturer to perform the final manufacturing steps of our chronogesic product candidate  and we anticipate that in the near future that we will need or choose to rely on a third party manufacturer to manufacture or perform manufacturing steps relating to our pharmaceutical systems or components 
see we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates to support our clinical and commercial requirements at an acceptable cost  and we have limited manufacturing experience 
we anticipate that we will continue to rely on these and other third party contractors to support development  clinical testing  and manufacturing of our pharmaceutical systems 
failure of these contractors to provide the required services in a timely manner or on reasonable commercial terms could materially delay the development and approval of our product candidates  increase our expenses and materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
key components of our pharmaceutical systems are provided by limited numbers of suppliers  and supply shortages or loss of these suppliers could result in interruptions in supply or increased costs certain components and drug substances used in our pharmaceutical systems including the saber post operative pain depot  the transdur sufentanil patch  remoxy  the durin based alzheimer s disease 
table of contents product and the chronogesic product candidates are currently purchased from a single or a limited number of outside sources 
the reliance on a sole or limited number of suppliers could result in delays associated with redesigning a product candidate due to a failure to obtain a single source component  an inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  and reduced control over pricing  quality and time delivery 
we have a supply agreement with mallinckrodt  inc for our sufentanil requirements for our chronogesic product candidate  the term of which is subject to automatic renewal for one year terms unless terminated by either party upon one year s prior written notice 
other than this agreement  we do not have long term agreements with any of our suppliers  and therefore the supply of a particular component could be terminated at any time without penalty to the supplier 
in addition  we may not be able to procure required components or drugs from third party suppliers at a quantity  quality and cost acceptable to us 
any interruption in the supply of single source components could cause us to seek alternative sources of supply or manufacture these components internally 
if the supply of any components for our pharmaceutical systems is interrupted  components from alternative suppliers may not be available in sufficient volumes or at acceptable quality levels within required timeframes  if at all  to meet our needs 
this could delay our ability to complete clinical trials and obtain approval for commercialization and marketing of our product candidates  causing us to lose sales  incur additional costs and delay new product introductions and could harm our reputation 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow through increased revenues or raising additional capital  then we may not be able to meet our substantial debt obligations as of december   we had approximately million in long term convertible subordinated notes which mature in june   in non current term loan obligations   in non current lease obligations   in non current bonds payable and  in other long term liabilities 
our substantial indebtedness  which totals million  has and will continue to impact us by making it more difficult to obtain additional financing  and constraining our ability to react quickly in an unfavorable economic climate 
currently we are not generating positive cash flow 
adverse occurrences related to our product development efforts will adversely impact our ability to meet our obligations to repay the principal amounts on our convertible subordinated notes when due in june in addition  if the market price of our common stock on the due date of our notes is below per share  the approximate equity conversion price of the notes  it will be highly unlikely that the holders of a large percentage of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes will convert such securities to equity in accordance with their existing terms 
if we are unable to satisfy our debt service requirements  substantial liquidity problems could result 
as of december  we had cash and investments valued at approximately million 
we expect to use substantially all of these assets to fund our on going operations over the next few years 
we may not generate sufficient cash from operations to repay our convertible subordinated notes or satisfy any other of these obligations when they become due and may have to raise additional financing from the sale of equity or debt securities or otherwise restructure our obligations in order to do so 
there can be no assurance that any such financing or restructuring will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to restructure our obligations  we may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws 
any restructure or bankruptcy could materially impair the value of our common stock 
we may not have sufficient funds to redeem our outstanding convertible subordinated notes if required to do so  and the redemption rights in our outstanding convertible subordinated notes could discourage a potential acquirer if we engage in any transaction or event in connection with which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive consideration which 
table of contents is not all or substantially all common stock listed on a united states national securities exchange or approved for quotation on the nasdaq national market or any similar united states system of automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices  or  if for any reason  our common stock is no longer listed for trading on a united states national securities exchange nor approved for trading on the nasdaq national market a fundamental change  we may be required to redeem all or part of the million in outstanding principal  plus any accrued but unpaid interest on our outstanding convertible promissory notes 
we may not have enough funds to pay the redemption price for all tendered notes 
in addition  any credit agreement or other agreements relating to our indebtedness may contain provisions prohibiting redemption of the notes under certain circumstances  or expressly prohibit our redemption of the notes upon a designated event or may provide that a designated event constitutes an event of default under that agreement 
our failure to redeem tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture  which might also constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness 
any such default could cause us to seek to restructure our indebtedness or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws  either of which could materially impair the value of our common stock 
a fundamental change could also discourage a potential acquirer 
however  this redemption feature is not the result of management s knowledge of any specific effort to obtain control of us by means of a merger  tender offer or solicitation  or part of a plan by management to adopt a series of anti takeover provisions 
the term fundamental change is limited to specified transactions and may not include other events that might adversely affect our financial condition or business operations 
we have a history of operating losses  expect to continue to have losses in the future and may never achieve or maintain profitability we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue to incur costs for research and development  clinical trials and manufacturing 
our ability to achieve profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to successfully complete the development of our proposed product candidates  obtain the required regulatory clearances and manufacture and market our proposed product candidates 
development of pharmaceutical systems is costly and requires significant investment 
in addition  we may choose to license either additional drug delivery platform technology or rights to particular drugs or other appropriate technology for use in our pharmaceutical systems 
the license fees for these technologies or rights would increase the costs of our pharmaceutical systems 
to date  we have not generated significant revenue from the commercial sale of our products and do not expect to receive significant revenue in the near future 
our current product revenues are from the sale of the alzet product we acquired in april from alza and the sale of biodegradable polymers 
we do not expect these product revenues to increase significantly in future periods 
we do not anticipate commercialization and marketing of our product candidates in development in the near future  and therefore do not expect to generate sufficient revenues to cover expenses or achieve profitability in the near future 
we may have difficulty raising needed capital in the future our business currently does not generate sufficient revenues to meet our capital requirements and we do not expect that it will do so in the near future 
we have expended and will continue to expend substantial funds to complete the research  development and clinical testing of our product candidates 
we will require additional funds for these purposes  to establish additional clinical and commercial scale manufacturing arrangements and facilities and to provide for the marketing and distribution of our product candidates 
additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are unavailable from operations or additional sources of financing  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs which would materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next months 
however  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued progress and cost of our research and development programs  success in entering into collaboration agreements and meeting milestones under such agreements  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory clearance  costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  costs of developing sales  marketing and distribution channels and our ability to sell our product candidates  costs involved in establishing manufacturing capabilities for clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates  competing technological and market developments  market acceptance of our product candidates  and costs for recruiting and retaining employees and consultants 
we may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated  resulting in the need for additional funding 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  convertible debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources  which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborators or other sources  we may have to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our product development efforts  resulting in loss of sales  increased costs  and reduced revenues 
investors may experience substantial dilution of their investment in the past  we have issued and have assumed  pursuant to the sbs acquisition  options and warrants to acquire common stock 
to the extent these outstanding options are ultimately exercised  there will be dilution to investors 
in addition  conversion of some or all of the million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes that we issued in june and july will dilute the ownership interests of investors 
investors may experience further dilution of their investment if we raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities 
see liquidity and capital resources 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
our stock price may fluctuate  and your investment in our stock could decline in value the average daily trading volume of our common stock for the twelve months ending december   was  shares 
the limited trading volume of our stock may contribute to its volatility  and an active trading market in our stock might not develop or continue 
in accordance with our common stock purchase agreement with endo  we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec on august  to register  shares of our common stock issued to endo and  shares issued to former apt shareholders for resale 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on september  pursuant to a purchase agreement with morgan stanley co  incorporated  we filed a registration statement with the sec on form s to register an aggregate of million in convertible subordinated notes for resale on august  the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on november  the convertible subordinated notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment and will bear interest at a rate of per annum 
so long as these registration statements are effective  shares covered thereunder are tradeable without limitation 
if 
table of contents substantial amounts of our common stock were to be sold in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
in addition  the existence of our convertible subordinated notes may encourage short selling by market participants 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors which are beyond our control 
the stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
in addition  the market prices of securities of technology and pharmaceutical companies have also been extremely volatile  and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations could result in extreme fluctuations in the price of our common stock  which could cause a decline in the value of our investors stock 
we could be exposed to significant product liability claims which could be time consuming and costly to defend  divert management attention and adversely impact our ability to obtain and maintain insurance coverage the testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of our product candidates involve an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against us 
although we are insured against such risks up to an annual aggregate limit in connection with clinical trials and commercial sales of our product candidates  our present product liability insurance may be inadequate and may not fully cover the costs of any claim or any ultimate damages we might be required to pay 
product liability claims or other claims related to our product candidates  regardless of their outcome  could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
any successful product liability claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable or reasonable terms 
in addition  product liability coverage may cease to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost 
an inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our pharmaceutical systems 
a product liability claim could also significantly harm our reputation and delay market acceptance of our product candidates 
we may be required to obtain rights to certain drugs some of the pharmaceutical systems that we are currently developing require the use of proprietary drugs to which we do not have commercial rights 
for example  our research collaboration with the university of maastricht has demonstrated that the use of a proprietary angiogenic factor in a pharmaceutical system can lead to elevated local concentration of the angiogenic factor in the pericardial sac of the heart  resulting in physical changes  including the growth of new blood vessels 
we do not currently have a license to develop or commercialize a product candidate containing such proprietary angiogenic factor 
to complete the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical systems containing drugs to which we do not have commercial rights  we will be required to obtain rights to those drugs 
we may not be able to do this at an acceptable cost  if at all 
if we are not able to obtain required rights to commercialize certain drugs  we may not be able to complete the development of pharmaceutical systems which require use of those drugs 
this could result in the cessation of certain development projects and the potential write off of certain assets 
technologies and businesses which we have acquired may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
we may also acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future  which could have these same effects we may acquire technologies  products or businesses to broaden the scope of our existing and planned product lines and technologies 
for example  in october  we acquired substantially all of the assets of intraear  inc  in april we acquired the alzet product and related assets from alza  in april  we completed the acquisition of sbs and in august  we acquired apt 
these and our future acquisitions expose us to increased costs associated with the acquisition and operation of the new businesses or technologies and the management of geographically dispersed operations  the risks associated with the assimilation of new technologies  operations  sites and personnel  
table of contents the diversion of resources from our existing business and technologies  the inability to generate revenues to offset associated acquisition costs  the requirement to maintain uniform standards  controls  and procedures  and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel 
acquisitions may also result in the issuance of dilutive equity securities  the incurrence or assumption of debt or additional expenses associated with the amortization of acquired intangible assets or potential businesses 
past acquisitions  such as our acquisitions of intraear  alzet  sbs and apt  as well future acquisitions  may not generate any additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
our limited operating history makes evaluating our stock difficult investors can only evaluate our business based on a limited operating history 
we were incorporated in february and have engaged primarily in research and development  licensing technology  raising capital and recruiting scientific and management personnel 
this short history may not be adequate to enable investors to fully assess our ability to successfully develop our product candidates  achieve market acceptance of our product candidates and respond to competition 
furthermore  we anticipate that our quarterly and annual results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as pharmaceuticals  drug delivery  and biotechnology 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates  which may not occur 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
we may require additional funds to complete the development of our product candidates and to fund operating losses to be incurred in the next several years 
acceptance of our product candidates in the marketplace is uncertain  and failure to achieve market acceptance will delay our ability to generate or grow revenues our future financial performance will depend upon the successful introduction and customer acceptance of our future products  including our saber post operative pain depot  transder sufentanil patch  remoxy  durin based alzheimer s disease and chronogesic product candidates 
even if approved for marketing  our product candidates may not achieve market acceptance 
the degree of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors  including the receipt of regulatory clearance of marketing claims for the uses that we are developing  the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the safety and clinical efficacy of our products and their potential advantages over existing therapeutic products  including oral medication  transdermal drug delivery products such as drug patches  or external or implantable drug delivery products  and pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third party payors such as insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other health plan administrators 
physicians  patients  payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept  utilize or recommend any of our products 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval  commercialize and market our future products when planned and achieve market acceptance  we will not achieve anticipated revenues 

table of contents if users of our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors  or if new restrictive legislation is adopted  market acceptance of our products may be limited and we may not achieve anticipated revenues the continuing efforts of government and insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability  and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers  suppliers and collaborative partners and the availability of capital 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  recent federal and state government initiatives have been directed at lowering the total cost of health care  and the us congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform  the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the medicare and medicaid systems 
while we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted  the announcement or adoption of such proposals could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the successful commercialization of our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our product candidates and related treatment are obtained by governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as hmos 
third party payors are increasingly limiting payments or reimbursement for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states and the concurrent growth of organizations such as hmos  which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may limit reimbursement or payment for our products 
the cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially harm our ability to operate profitably 
we may be sued by third parties which claim that our product candidates infringe on their intellectual property rights  particularly because there is substantial uncertainty about the validity and breadth of medical patents we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our product candidates or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others or that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents and the breadth and scope of trade secret protection involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not valid  could result in substantial costs  could place a significant strain on our financial resources and could harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following  any of which could harm our business or financial results cease selling  incorporating or using any of our product candidates that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which would adversely affect our revenue  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which license may be costly or may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  or redesign our product candidates  which would be costly and time consuming 
if we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to third party patents  we may lose valuable assets  experience reduced market share or incur costly litigation to protect our rights our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
as of december   we held issued us patents and issued foreign patents 
in addition  we have pending us patent applications and have filed patent applications under the patent cooperation treaty  from which national phase applications are currently 
table of contents pending in europe  australia  japan  canada  mexico  new zealand  brazil  israel and china 
our patents expire at various dates starting in the year under our agreement with alza  we must assign to alza any intellectual property rights relating to the duros system and its manufacture and any combination of the duros system with other components  active agents  features or processes 
in addition  alza retains the right to enforce and defend against infringement actions relating to the duros system  and if alza exercises these rights  it will be entitled to the proceeds of these infringement actions 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies  including ours  are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
in addition  the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued 
consequently  our patent applications or those of alza that are licensed to us may not issue into patents  and any issued patents may not provide protection against competitive technologies or may be held invalid if challenged or circumvented 
our competitors may also independently develop products similar to ours or design around or otherwise circumvent patents issued to us or licensed by us 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as us law 
we also rely upon trade secrets  technical know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we require our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators to execute appropriate confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements with us 
these agreements typically provide that all materials and confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances  and that all inventions arising out of the individual s relationship with us shall be our exclusive property 
these agreements may be breached  and in some instances  we may not have an appropriate remedy available for breach of the agreements 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  reverse engineer our information and techniques  or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology 
we may be unable to meaningfully protect our rights in trade secrets  technical know how and other non patented technology 
we may have to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights  or to determine their scope  validity or enforceability 
enforcing or defending our proprietary rights is expensive  could cause diversion of our resources and may not prove successful 
any failure to enforce or protect our rights could cause us to lose the ability to exclude others from using our technology to develop or sell competing products 
if we or our third party collaborators are unable to train physicians to use our pharmaceutical systems to treat patients diseases or medical conditions  we may incur delays in market acceptance of our products broad use of our pharmaceutical systems will require extensive training of numerous physicians on the proper and safe use of our products 
the time required to begin and complete training of physicians could delay introduction of our products and adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
we or third parties selling our products may be unable to rapidly train physicians in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our pharmaceutical systems 
any delay in training would materially delay the demand for our systems and harm our business and financial results 
in addition  we may expend significant funds towards such training before any orders are placed for our products  which would increase our expenses and harm our financial results 
some of our product candidates contain controlled substances  the making  use  sale  importation and distribution of which are subject to regulation by state  federal and foreign law enforcement and other regulatory agencies some of our product candidates currently under development contain  and our products in the future may contain  controlled substances which are subject to state  federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding their manufacture  use  sale  importation and distribution 
our transdur sufentanil patch  remoxy and chronogesic product candidates and other product candidates we have under development contain opioids 
table of contents which are classified as schedule ii controlled substances under the regulations of the us drug enforcement agency 
for our product candidates containing controlled substances  we and our suppliers  manufacturers  contractors  customers and distributors are required to obtain and maintain applicable registrations from state  federal and foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies and comply with state  federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture  use  sale  importation and distribution of controlled substances 
these regulations are extensive and include regulations governing manufacturing  labeling  packaging  testing  dispensing  production and procurement quotas  record keeping  reporting  handling  shipment and disposal 
failure to obtain and maintain required registrations or comply with any applicable regulations could delay or preclude us from developing and commercializing our product candidates containing controlled substances and subject us to enforcement action 
in addition  because of their restrictive nature  these regulations could limit our commercialization of our product candidates containing controlled substances 
write offs related to the impairment of long lived assets and other non cash charges  as well as future deferred compensation expenses may adversely impact or delay our profitability we may incur significant non cash charges related to impairment write downs of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill and assembled workforce on january  however  we will continue to incur non cash charges related to amortization of other intangible assets 
we are required to perform periodic impairment reviews of our goodwill at least annually 
to the extent these reviews conclude that the expected future cash flows generated from our business activities are not sufficient to recover the cost of our long lived assets  we will be required to measure and record an impairment charge to write down these assets to their realizable values 
we completed our last review during the fourth quarter of and determined that goodwill was not impaired as of december  however  there can be no assurance that upon completion of subsequent reviews a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
if future periodic reviews determine that our assets are impaired and a write down is required  it will adversely impact or delay our profitability 
to date  we have recorded deferred compensation expenses related to stock options grants  including stock options assumed in our acquisition of sbs  which will be amortized through in addition  deferred compensation expense related to option awards to non employees will be calculated during the vesting period of the option based on the then current price of our common stock  which could result in significant charges that adversely impact or delay our profitability 
furthermore  we have issued to alza common stock and a warrant to purchase common stock with an aggregate value of approximately million  which will be amortized over time based on sales of our duros based products and which will also adversely impact or delay our profitability 
we depend upon key personnel who may terminate their employment with us at any time  and we need to hire additional qualified personnel our success will depend to a significant degree upon the continued services of key management  technical  and scientific personnel  including felix theeuwes  our chairman and chief scientific officer  james e 
brown  our president and chief executive officer and thomas a 
schreck  our chief financial officer 
although we have obtained key man life insurance policies for each of messrs 
theeuwes  brown and schreck in the amount of million  this insurance may not adequately compensate us for the loss of their services 
in addition  our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain other highly skilled personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and the process of hiring and integrating such qualified personnel is often lengthy 
we may be unable to recruit such personnel on a timely basis  if at all 
our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time 
the loss of the services of key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  could result in delays to product development or approval  loss of sales and diversion of management resources 

table of contents we may not successfully manage our growth our success will depend on the timely expansion of our operations and the effective management of growth  which will place a significant strain on our management and on our administrative  operational and financial resources 
to manage such growth  we must expand our facilities  augment our operational  financial and management systems and hire  train and supervise additional qualified personnel 
if we were unable to manage growth effectively our business would be harmed 
the market for our product candidates is new  rapidly changing and competitive  and new products or technologies developed by others could impair our ability to grow our business and remain competitive the pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological change 
developments by others may render our product candidates under development or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete  or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors 
technological competition in the industry from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities  governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase 
many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do  as well as substantially more marketing  manufacturing  financial and managerial resources 
these entities represent significant competition for us 
acquisitions of  or investments in  competing pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies by large corporations could increase such competitors financial  marketing  manufacturing and other resources 
we are engaged in the development of novel therapeutic technologies 
our resources are limited and we may experience technical challenges inherent in such novel technologies 
competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for competitive products 
some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic effects than our product candidates 
our competitors may develop products that are safer  more effective or less costly than our product candidates and  therefore  present a serious competitive threat to our product offerings 
the widespread acceptance of therapies that are alternatives to ours may limit market acceptance of our product candidates even if commercialized 
chronic and post operative pain are currently being treated by oral medication  transdermal drug delivery systems  such as drug patches  and implantable drug delivery devices which will be competitive with our product candidates 
these treatments are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use 
the established use of these competitive products may limit the potential for our product candidates to receive widespread acceptance if commercialized 
our business involves environmental risks and risks related to handling regulated substances in connection with our research and development activities and our manufacture of materials and product candidates  we are subject to federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials  biological specimens and wastes 
although we believe that we have complied with the applicable laws  regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to correct any material noncompliance  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future 
our research and development involves the use  generation and disposal of hazardous materials  including but not limited to certain hazardous chemicals  solvents  agents and biohazardous materials 
the extent of our use  generation and disposal of such substances has increased substantially since we started manufacturing and selling biodegradable polymers 
although we believe that our safety procedures for storing  handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
we currently contract with third parties to dispose of these substances generated by us  and we rely on these third parties to properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
if these third parties do not properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to legal action by governmental agencies or private parties for improper disposal of these substances 

table of contents the costs of defending such actions and the potential liability resulting from such actions are often very large 
in the event we are subject to such legal action or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the use  generation and disposal of hazardous materials and chemicals  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could exceed our resources 
our agreement with alza limits our fields of operation for our duros based pharmaceutical systems and gives alza a first right to negotiate to distribute selected products for us our agreement with alza gives us exclusive rights to develop  commercialize and manufacture products using alza s duros technology to deliver by catheter drugs to the central nervous system to treat select nervous system disorders  drugs to the middle and inner ear  drugs to the pericardial sac of the heart  and select drugs into vascular grafts 
we also have the right to use the duros technology to deliver systemically and by catheter sufentanil to treat chronic pain  and select cancer antigens 
we may not develop  manufacture or commercialize duros based pharmaceutical systems outside of these specific fields without alza s prior approval 
in addition  if we develop or commercialize any drug delivery technology for use in a manner similar to the duros technology in a field covered in our license agreement with alza  then we may lose our exclusive rights to use the duros technology in such field as well as the right to develop new product candidates using duros technology in such field 
in order to maintain commercialization rights for our products on a worldwide basis  we must diligently develop our product candidates  procure required regulatory approvals and commercialize the product candidates in selected major market countries 
if we fail to meet commercialization diligence requirements  we may lose rights for products in some or all countries  including the us these rights would revert to alza  which could then develop duros based pharmaceutical products in such countries itself or license others to do so 
in addition  in the event that our rights terminate with respect to any product or country  or this agreement terminates or expires in its entirety except for termination by us due to a breach by alza  alza will have the exclusive right to use all of our data  rights and information relating to the products developed under the agreement as necessary for alza to commercialize these products  subject to the payment of a royalty to us based on the net sales of the products by alza 
our agreement with alza gives us the right to perform development work and manufacture the duros pump component of our duros based pharmaceutical systems 
in the event of a change in our corporate control  including an acquisition of us  our right to manufacture and perform development work on the duros pump would terminate and alza would have the right to manufacture and develop duros systems for us so long as alza can meet our specification and supply requirements following such change in control 
under the alza agreement  we must pay alza royalties on sales of duros based pharmaceutical systems we commercialize and a percentage of any up front license fees  milestone or special fees  payments or other consideration we receive  excluding research and development funding 
in addition  commencing upon the commercial sale of a product developed under the agreement  we are obligated to make minimum product payments to alza on a quarterly basis based on our good faith projections of our net product sales of the product 
these minimum payments will be fully credited against the product royalty payments we must pay to alza 

table of contents alza may obtain from us  for its own behalf or on behalf of one of its affiliates  the exclusive right to develop and commercialize a product in a field of use exclusively licensed to us  provided that such product does not incorporate a drug in the same drug class and is not intended for the same therapeutic indication as a product which is then being developed or commercialized by us or for which we have made commitments to a third party 
in the event that alza or an affiliate commercializes such a product  alza or its affiliate will pay us a royalty on sales of such product at a specified rate 
alza also has an exclusive option to distribute any duros based pharmaceutical system we develop to deliver non proprietary cancer antigens worldwide 
the terms of any distribution arrangement have not been set and are to be negotiated in good faith between alza and us 
alza s option to acquire distribution rights limits our ability to negotiate with other distributors for these products and may result in lower payments to us than if these rights were subject to competitive negotiations 
we must allow alza an opportunity to negotiate in good faith for commercialization rights to our products developed under the agreement prior to granting these rights to a third party 
these rights do not apply to products that are subject to alza s option or products for which we have obtained funding or access to a proprietary drug from a third party to whom we have granted commercialization rights prior to the commencement of human clinical trials 
alza has the right to terminate the agreement in the event that we breach a material obligation under the agreement and do not cure the breach in a timely manner 
in addition  alza has the right to terminate the agreement if at any time prior to july  we solicit for employment or hire  without alza s consent  a person who is or within the previous days has been an employee of alza in the duros technology group 
we do not control alza s ability to develop and commercialize duros technology outside of fields licensed to us  and problems encountered by alza could result in negative publicity  loss of sales and delays in market acceptance of our duros based pharmaceutical systems alza retains complete rights to the duros technology for fields outside the specific fields licensed to us 
accordingly  alza may develop and commercialize duros based products or license others to do so  so long as there is no conflict with the rights granted to us 
alza received fda approval to market its first duros based product  viadur leuprolide acetate implants for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer in march if alza or its commercialization partner  bayer  fails to commercialize this product successfully  or encounters problems associated with this product  negative publicity could be created about all duros based products  which could result in harm to our reputation and cause reduced sales of our duros based product candidates 
in addition  if any third party that may be licensed by alza fails to develop and commercialize duros based products successfully  the success of all duros based systems could be impeded  including ours  resulting in delay or loss of revenue or damage to our reputation  any one of which could harm our business

legislative actions  potential new accounting pronouncements and higher insurance costs are likely to impact our future financial position or results of operations future changes in financial accounting standards  including proposed changes in accounting for employee stock based awards  may cause adverse  unexpected fluctuations in the timing of the recognition of revenues or expenses and may affect our financial position or results of operations 
new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future and we may make changes in our accounting policies in the future 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations  pcaob pronouncements and nasdaq national market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours and insurance  accounting and auditing costs are increasing as a result of this uncertainty and other factors 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
fixed rate securities and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall and floating rate borrowings may lead to additional interest expense if interest rates increase 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities  auction rate securities  corporate bonds and market auction preferreds 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objective 
as of december   approximately of our investment portfolio is composed of investments with original maturities of one year or less and approximately of our investment portfolio matures less than days from the date of purchase
