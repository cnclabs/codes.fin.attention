to calculate ffo under the nareit definition  depreciation and amortization expenses related to the company s real estate  gains or losses realized from the disposition of depreciable real estate assets  and certain extraordinary items are added back to the company s net income 
the company believes that ffo more appropriately reflects the company s operating performance because ffo excludes the depreciation expense on real estate assets and real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than other depreciable assets such as machinery or equipment 
additionally  other real estate companies  analysts and investors utilize ffo in analyzing the results of real estate companies 
while the company uses the nareit definition of ffo  the company s ffo may not be comparable to other reits or real estate companies with similar assets 
this is due in part to the differences in capitalization policies used by different companies and the significant effect these capitalization policies have on ffo 
real estate costs incurred in connection with real estate operations which are accounted for as capital improvements are added 
table of contents to the carrying value of the property and depreciated over time whereas real estate costs that are expensed are accounted for as a current period expense 
this affects ffo because costs that are accounted for as expenses reduce ffo 
conversely  real estate costs that are capitalized and depreciated are added back to net income to calculate ffo 
during the periods reported above  the company s capitalization policy was to treat most recurring capital improvements  such as appliances  vinyl flooring and carpet as expenses  and this may cause the company s reported ffo to be lower than peer companies that capitalize recurring improvements of these types 
although the company considers ffo to be a useful measure of its operating performance  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with gaap

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements this report including  but not limited to  the information contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that reflect management s current beliefs and estimates of future economic circumstances  industry conditions  the company s performance and financial results 
all statements  trend analysis and other information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations of the company and the real estate investments it has made constitute forward looking statements 
shareholders and others should understand that these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  and a number of factors could affect the future results of the company and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements contained herein 
these factors include local and national economic conditions  the amount of new construction  affordability of home ownership  interest rates on single family home mortgages and on the company s variable rate borrowings  government regulation  price inflation  the level of real estate and other taxes imposed on the properties  labor problems and natural disasters and other items discussed under risk factors in item of this report 
general the company s primary business is the operation of multifamily apartment properties as long term investments 
accordingly  the company s operating results will depend primarily on the net operating income generated by its multifamily apartment properties 
this  in turn  will depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the properties and on the level of operating expenses 
occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of  and demand for  apartments in the market areas in which a property is located 
several factors influence this  including local and national economic conditions  the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single family mortgage loans 
in addition  factors such as government regulation such as zoning laws  inflation  real estate and other taxes  labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property 

table of contents the multifamily real estate industry is experiencing soft market conditions in most markets nationwide  including many of those in which the company owns properties 
these conditions are primarily attributable to i slow economic growth which has limited job creation and the number of new households  ii historically low mortgage interest rates which have made home ownership more affordable for many persons who would otherwise be renting apartments and iii continuous building of new apartment properties in markets that are already experiencing low occupancy rates 
in response to these conditions  the company has had to reduce rental rates and grant rental concessions to attract and retain quality tenants and maintain the physical occupancy levels at its properties 
these measures allowed the company to increase the overall average physical occupancy of its multifamily apartment properties from during to in including the additional properties related to the afrez merger in june the physical occupancy for properties owned by the company prior to the afrez merger was in the average economic occupancy of the company s multifamily apartment properties was during and economic occupancy is defined as the net rental income divided by the maximum amount of rental income which could be derived from each property 
this statistic is reflective of vacancy  rental concessions  delinquent rents  bad debt and other non revenue units such as model units and employee units 
in  the company expanded the types of assets in which it may invest to include i agency securities issued or guaranteed as to the payment of principal or interest by an agency of the us government or a federally chartered corporation such as the fnma  gnma or the fhlmc agency securities  ii mezzanine level financing provided to unaffiliated developers of residential real estate which can take a variety of forms including subordinated mortgage loans and preferred equity investments  and iii equity investments in other reits and similar real estate companies  which can include publicly traded common and preferred stocks  as well as controlling and non controlling interests in other real estate businesses such as property management companies 
as of december   the company held agency securities with a fair market value of approximately million and investments in other real estate companies with a fair market value of approximately million 
by investing in agency securities  mezzanine level financing of residential properties  and investments in other real estate companies  the company seeks to supplement and stabilize its cash flow by investing in assets that are less affected by the variables that affect the cash flow generated by investments in apartments 
in addition  investments in agency securities will allow the company to quickly invest the proceeds from the sale of additional stock or from the sale of any of its real property investments at potentially higher returns than traditional money market investments 
the overall mix of these various types of investments will vary from time to time as the company seeks to take advantage of opportunities in the real estate industry 
in general  however  it is anticipated that at least of the company s equity capital will be invested in multifamily apartment properties 
as of december   approximately of the company s equity capital was invested in multifamily apartment properties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management of the company to make a number of judgments  assumptions and estimates 
the application of these judgments  assumptions and estimates can affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported by the company 
all of the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements filed in response to item of this report 
the company considers the following to be its critical accounting policies as they involve judgments  assumptions and estimates that significantly affect the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents investment in agency securities valuation because all of the company s investments in agency securities are classified as available for sale securities  they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values 
the estimated fair values reflect the average of price quotes received from brokers  which are reviewed by the company 
price quotes are subject to the brokers judgments  assumptions and estimates 
effect of classification of securities on earnings because the company s investments in agency securities are classified as available for sale securities  changes in estimated fair values are recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a component of stockholders equity  rather than through earnings 
the company does not intend to hold any of its securities for trading purposes  however  if the company s available for sale securities were classified as trading securities  there could be substantially greater volatility in the company s earnings 
investment in real estate establishment of depreciation policy the company s investment in real estate is carried on the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of real estate is based on the estimated useful life of the related asset  years on multifamily residential apartment buildings  years on commercial buildings and five to fifteen years on capital improvements  and is calculated using the straight line method 
depreciation of capital improvements on the company s commercial property is based on the term of the related tenant lease using the straight line method 
shorter or longer depreciable lives and method of depreciation directly impact depreciation expense recorded in earnings 
establishment of capitalization policy maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred  while significant improvements  renovations and replacements are capitalized 
the company s capitalization policy is based on management s judgment and is not necessarily consistent with companies of similar type as there is diversity in such accounting policies adopted by the real estate industry 
the company believes its policy is reasonable in that it capitalizes costs considered to add value to the property  while it expenses those costs which are considered recurring maintenance items 
in particular  the cost of replacing carpet  vinyl flooring and appliances in individual apartments have been expensed  although some real estate companies capitalize these costs 
beginning in  the company modified its capitalization policy 
the company now capitalizes the appliances within the individual units including such items as ovens  refrigerators and water heaters 
these items were traditionally expensed as incurred 
the company has also modified its policy to reduce specific thresholds for capitalizing certain items 
the company will continue to expense carpet and vinyl flooring as incurred 
these modifications occurred beginning in and will only affect newly acquired assets on a prospective basis 
this change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and will be accounted for prospectively 
review of properties for impairment management reviews each property for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based upon comparing the net book value of each real estate property to the sum of its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value 
the recognition of an impaired property and the potential impairment calculation are subject to a considerable degree of judgment  the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements 
the 
table of contents estimated future cash flow of each property is subject to a significant amount of uncertainty in the estimation of future rental receipts  future rental expenses  and future capital expenditures 
such estimates are affected by economic factors such as the rental markets and labor markets in which the properties operate  the current market values for properties in the rental markets  and tax and insurance expenses 
different conditions or different assumptions applied to the calculation may result in different results 
the company does periodically compare the results of its estimates with historical results to evaluate the reasonableness and accuracy of its estimates and adjusts its estimates accordingly 
results of operations the tables below compare the results of the company s operations for each year shown 
as of january   the company merged with america first apartment investors  lp the partnership 
as a result of this merger  the company assumed the assets  liabilities and business operations of the partnership 
the company itself had no material assets or operations prior to its merger with the partnership 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company for all periods prior to january  are those of the partnership

an increase of approximately million in rental income was attributable to seven months of income from the properties acquired through the merger with afrez 
rental income generated by the properties held by the company prior to the merger with afrez same store increased approximately  during compared to rental income generated during same store rent per unit increased to  per unit in compared to  per unit in rent per unit is calculated by dividing rental income by the total number of units in the properties that produced those revenues 
real estate operating expenses 
real estate operating expenses are comprised principally of real estate taxes  property insurance  utilities  repairs and maintenance  property management fees  and salaries and related employee expenses of on site employees

depreciation expense 
the increase in depreciation expense of million is entirely related to the acquisition of fourteen additional properties through the merger with afrez and the inclusion of the depreciation expense of these properties for seven months of the year 
depreciation expense incurred by the properties held by the company prior to the merger with afrez was consistent with the depreciation expense incurred during the same period in 
table of contents interest income on cash and cash equivalents and agency securities and dividend income

on june   the owners of jefferson place apartments sold the property 
the company recorded a gain of approximately million on the repayment of its subordinate note due from jefferson place apartments 
the company did not record any income from this transaction in interest expense 
interest expense includes interest paid on debt  amortization of financing costs and the effect of settled interest rate swaps 
the increased interest expense is directly attributable to seven months of interest expense on borrowings assumed through the merger with afrez of approximately million 
average debt related to non afrez properties remained flat year over year 
general and administrative expenses 
the majority of the increase is attributable to the merger with afrez and the inclusion of its corporate general and administrative expenses for seven months of the year 
the most significant impact was the increase due to salaries and related benefits which was approximately million and the increase due to administrative fees which was approximately  in addition  there was approximately  of costs associated with the company s implementation of sarbanes oxley section pertaining to the company s internal controls 
amortization expense in place lease intangibles 
this increase is directly related to the amortization of the in place lease intangibles recorded as a result of the merger with afrez 
in place lease intangibles arise as a result of the allocation of the total acquisition costs whereby the company allocates a portion of the total acquisition cost of a property acquired to leases in existence as of the date of acquisition 
the estimated valuation of in place leases is calculated by applying a risk adjusted discount rate to the projected cash flow realized at each property during the estimated lease up period it would take to lease these properties 
this allocated cost is amortized over the average remaining term of the leases approximately twelve months 
property management internalization expense 
the company acquired certain property management assets  rights to use certain proprietary systems  certain property management agreements  certain employment agreements and other intangible assets in november of the million acquisition price  million was expensed 
the amount expensed was an allocation of the acquisition price to the termination of the existing property management relationship on the company s properties 
through the acquisition of the property management assets  the company internalized the property management function 
as a result  the company will no longer pay property management fees previously expensed in real estate operating expense

the net cash proceeds to the company were approximately million  net of closing costs of approximately  a gain on the sale of this property was realized in the amount of million 
the company acquired this property during year ended december  compared to the year ended december  rental income 
the decrease is due to the decline in the economic occupancies of the properties 
rental concessions significantly increased in order to attract and retain qualified tenants  and have reduced net effective rental rates earned at the company s properties 
in addition  the average physical occupancy of the company s multifamily apartment properties declined by in as a result  the average effective annual 
table of contents rentals per unit of the company s multifamily apartment properties decreased to  in from  in real estate operating expenses 
real estate operating expenses  comprised principally of real estate taxes  property insurance  utilities  property management fees  repairs and maintenance  and salaries and related employee expenses of on site employees  increased primarily due to an overall increase in the premium rates for property insurance  which was approximately  and increases in salaries and related expenditures of  this was slightly offset by reductions in management fees and contract expenses 
depreciation expense 
the increase is attributable to capital improvements of approximately  made during interest on cash and cash equivalents and agency securities and dividend income 
interest on cash and cash equivalents and dividend income increased a net  in compared to this increase is due to the purchase of agency securities during the last quarter of the company purchased agency securities with a par value of million during the fourth quarter of the pools have stated rates ranging from to and various principal maturities 
the premium paid related to these agency securities will be amortized using the effective yield method over the life of the pools 
prior to the fourth quarter of  the company had no such investments and did not record any such interest income 
offsetting this increase is a decrease in interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents which was primarily due to a decrease in the average interest rate earned on cash and cash equivalents 
the average interest rate during was compared to for interest expense 
the decrease is due to the decline in the average interest rate of the company s variable rate debt which declined to in  compared to in approximately of the company s bonds and mortgage notes payable bear interest at variable rates as of december  general and administrative expenses 
the increase is primarily due to an increase in board of directors fees  stock option compensation  salaries and employee benefits  insurance and accounting and legal fees 
the company incurred approximately  of compensation expense related to its stock option plan 
in addition  the company has incurred increases in legal and accounting fees which are primarily due to the newly enacted sarbanes oxley and other regulatory compliance requirements

the company s ffo decreased million or to million for the year ended  compared to million for the same period in this is primarily due to the property management internalization expense related to the company purchase of certain property management agreements  employment agreements and other intangible assets from america first properties 
in conjunction with this acquisition  the company recorded expense of million 
in addition  ffo in included a gain of approximately million related to the repayment of the subordinated note due from the owners of jefferson place apartments 
the decrease was offset by favorable rental income compared to  primarily due to the afrez merger 
ffo is calculated in accordance with the definition of ffo that is recommended by the national association of real investment trust nareit 
to calculate ffo under the nareit definition  depreciation and amortization expenses related to the company s real estate  gains or losses realized from the disposition of depreciable real estate assets  and certain extraordinary items are added back to the company s net income 
the company believes that ffo is an important non gaap measurement because ffo excludes the depreciation expense on real estate assets and real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than other depreciable assets such as machinery or equipment

while the company uses the nareit definition of ffo  the company s ffo may not be comparable to other reits or real estate companies with similar assets 
this is due in part to the differences in capitalization policies used by different companies and the significant effect these capitalization policies have on ffo 
real estate costs incurred in connection with real estate operations which are accounted for as capital improvements are added to the carrying value of the property and depreciated over time whereas real estate costs that are expensed are accounted for as a current period expense

this change will be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis 
although the company considers ffo to be a useful measure of its operating performance  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with gaap 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of cash is net rental revenues generated by its real estate investments 
net rental revenues from a multifamily apartment property depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and on the level of operating expenses 
occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of  and demand for  apartments in the market areas in which a property is located 
this  in turn  is affected by several factors  such as local or national economic conditions  the amount of new apartment construction and affordability of home ownership 
in addition  factors such as government regulation such as zoning laws  inflation  real estate and other taxes  labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property 
the company uses cash primarily to i pay the operating expenses of its multifamily apartment properties  including the cost of capital improvements and  prior to november  fees paid to the property manager  ii to pay the operating expenses of the company s administration  including the fees paid to its advisor  iii the payment of debt service on its bonds and mortgages payable  iv the acquisition of additional multifamily apartment properties  agency securities and other investments  and v the payment of dividends 
currently  the company s cash provided by operations is insufficient to fully fund the current level of dividends 
while the company has the ability to fund the current level of dividends through other means  including proceeds from the sale of properties  continued weakness in operating cash flows could negatively impact dividend rates 
the company currently expects to maintain dividends at the current rate 
the company s principal business strategy is to acquire and operate multifamily apartment properties as long term investments 
in order to achieve its acquisition strategy  the company has the authority to finance the acquisition of additional real estate in a variety of manners  including raising additional equity capital 
to fully pursue its acquisition strategy  the company will need to raise additional equity capital 
in june  the company filed a form s registration statement for million of capital stock which may be sold from time to time in order to raise additional equity capital in order to support the company s business strategy 
to date  no securities have been sold under this registration statement 
in addition to the funds that the company may raise through the issuance of additional equity capital  it may also be able to borrow money to finance the acquisition of additional real estate assets 
borrowing to acquire additional multifamily apartment properties is generally in the form of long term taxable or tax exempt mortgage loans secured by the acquired properties 
the amount of debt the company can incur is not limited by its charter or otherwise 
in general  however  the amount of borrowing used to finance the overall multifamily apartment property portfolio is approximately to of the purchase price of these assets  although higher or lower levels of borrowings may be used on any single property 
the multifamily apartment properties which the company currently owns are financed under twenty mortgage financings with an aggregate principal balance of million as of december  these mortgages consisted of thirteen tax exempt bonds with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of approximately million and seven taxable mortgage notes payable with a combined principal balance of approximately million 
approximately of these mortgage obligations bear interest at a fixed rate with a weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december  the remaining of these mortgage obligations bear interest at variable rates that had a weighted average interest rate of  including swaps  for the year ended december  maturity dates on these mortgage obligations range from september to july each of these mortgage loans has been made on a nonrecourse basis  which means that the lender s source of payment in the event of a default is limited to foreclosure of the underlying property securing the mortgage loan 
the mortgage obligation maturing in relates to the littlestone at village green property and amounts to approximately million 
the company plans to refinance this obligation when due 

table of contents in addition  the company has borrowings in the form of notes payable and borrowings under repurchase agreements 
the notes payable  which were assumed as part of the merger with afrez  bear interest at a variable rate with a weighted average interest rate for the seven month period since assumption of 
these notes payable are due january  the borrowings under repurchase agreements bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december  and mature within one year 
acquisitions of agency securities are principally financed with repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements take the form of a sale of a security in this case  an agency security owned by the company to a counterparty at an agreed upon price in return for the counterparty s simultaneous agreement to resell the same securities back to the owner at a future date at a higher price 
although structured as a sale and repurchase obligation  a repurchase agreement operates as a borrowing under which the company pledges agency securities that it already owns as collateral to secure a short term loan with a counterparty 
the borrowings are then used to acquire additional agency securities  which themselves may be used as collateral for additional borrowings under repurchase agreements 
the difference between the sale and repurchase price is the cost  or interest expense  of borrowing under the repurchase agreements 
the repurchase agreements may require the company to pledge additional assets to the lender in the event the market value of existing pledged collateral declines below a specified percentage 
the pledged collateral may fluctuate in value due to  among other things  principal repayments  market changes in interest rates and credit quality 
the company retains beneficial ownership of the pledged collateral  including the right to distributions  while the counterparty maintains custody of the collateral securities 
at the maturity of a repurchase agreement  the company is required to repay the loan and concurrently receive back its pledged collateral from the lender or  may renew the repurchase agreement at the then prevailing financing rate 
as of december   the company had borrowed approximately million under short term repurchase agreements to finance its investment in agency securities 
these repurchase agreements have a weighted average interest rate of and a weighted average maturity of days 
total borrowings to acquire agency securities are currently limited by the company to not more than eight times the amount of equity capital invested or set aside for investment by the company in agency securities  although the company can increase this limitation with the approval of the board of directors 
the company may use derivatives and other hedging strategies to help mitigate interest rate risks on the long term borrowings used to finance its properties and the prepayment and interest rate risks on its agency securities 
the company may use interest rate caps  interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to achieve these goals  but the timing and amount of hedging transactions  if any  will depend on numerous market conditions  including  but not limited to  the interest rate environment  management s assessment of the future changes in interest rates and the market availability and cost of entering into such hedge transactions 
in addition  management s ability to employ hedging strategies may be restricted by requirements for maintaining reit status 
it is against management policy to enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased by million compared to the same period a year earlier due to higher net rental income as a result of the afrez merger 
cash provided by investing activities increased approximately million for compared to due to the net cash acquired in the acquisition of afrez of approximately million  the impact of principal received on agency securities of approximately million in which were not owned in the previous period  proceeds from the sale of real estate of million and proceeds received from the sale of corporate equity securities owned by the company of million 
also contributing to the change was the acquisition of agency securities of million in compared to only million of agency securities acquisitions in offsetting the increases were cash paid for the property management internalization acquisition of million  including fees  the acquisition of real estate of approximately million  the acquisition of afrez of 
table of contents million and the net proceeds received in the prior period on the repayment of the jefferson place subordinate note of approximately million 
net cash used in financing activities for the year increased million compared to this was primarily due to a decrease in the proceeds from borrowings under repurchase agreements 
in  the company received million related to repurchase agreements borrowings compared to none in additionally  principal payments of approximately million were made on borrowings under repurchase agreements during that were not made in and dividends paid increased million due to the higher number of shareholders as a result of the merger with afrez 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  the company does not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships 
the company does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationships with the company or its related parties other than what is disclosed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the company had the following contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years notes payable bonds and mortgage notes payable borrowings under repurchase agreements the company is also contractually obligated to pay interest on its long term debt obligations 
the weighted average interest rate of the long term debt obligations outstanding as of december  was approximately for fixed rate debt and for variable rate debt 
the company intends to renew its repurchase agreements which come due in with repurchase agreements having similar terms 
inflation substantially all of the resident leases at the company s multifamily apartment properties allow  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the rent payable  and thus may enable the company to seek rent increases 
the substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation  however  market conditions may prevent the company from increasing rental rates in amounts sufficient to offset higher operating expenses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk on bonds and mortgage notes payable the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long term borrowings 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond the company s control 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and enters into derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  in order to manage and mitigate its interest rate risk 
the company has not entered into derivative instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
as of december   approximately of the company s long term borrowings consisted of fixed rate financing 
the remaining consisted of variable rate financing 
variations in interest rates affect the company s cost of borrowing on its variable rate financing 
the interest rates payable by the company on these obligations increase or decrease with certain index interest rates 
if the company s borrowing costs increase  the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders will decrease 
had the average index rates increased or 
table of contents decreased by basis points during the year ended december   interest expense on the company s variable rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately  respectively 
the following table presents information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s bonds and mortgage payable in thousands fixed rate borrowings weighted principal average maturity amount interest rate thereafter variable rate borrowings weighted principal average maturity amount interest rate thereafter weighted average rate for the year ended december   assumes the current rates 
table of contents as of december   the company had entered into the following derivative financial instruments in thousands interest rate swaps and caps counterparty company notional receive notional pay maturity amount cap rate amount rate fixed to variable december    fixed to variable december    fixed to variable december    variable to fixed february    variable to fixed june    fixed to variable july    fixed to variable july    interest rate cap december   n a n a interest rate cap december   n a n a notional amount is tied to the the exchange at palm bay bond payable and adjusts downwards as principal payments are made on the bond payable

these are total return swaps the million variable to fixed rate swap was entered into on top of and to mitigate the variable rate risk of those fixed to variable rate swap maturing july  it effectively fixes the interest rate on million of bonds payable at through june  the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was an asset of approximately  as of december  the company does not use hedge accounting for its derivative instruments 
therefore  changes in the fair value of its interest rate swaps and caps are reflected in the statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
as the above tables incorporate only those exposures or positions that existed as of december   they do not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
the company s ultimate economic impact with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s risk mitigating strategies at that time and interest rates 
prepayment risk on agency securities as the company receives repayments of principal on its agency securities  premiums paid on such securities are amortized against interest income 
premiums arise when the company acquires agency securities at a price in excess of the principal balance of the mortgages securing such agency securities or the par value of such agency securities if purchased at the original issue 
for financial accounting purposes interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal balance of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
purchase premiums on the company s agency securities are amortized against interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method  adjusted for actual prepayment activity 
in general  an increase in the prepayment rate will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the yield interest income earned on such assets 
cash concentrations of credit risk the company s cash and cash equivalents are deposited primarily in a trust account at a single financial institution and are not covered by the federal deposit insurance corporation
