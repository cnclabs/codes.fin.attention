table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance self insurance liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales  net of estimated returns  at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services 
when the company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services  the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed 
the company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels 
the company evaluates the criteria of the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions 
generally  when costco is the primary obligor  is subject to inventory risk  has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers  influence product or service specifications  or has several but not all of these indicators  revenue is recorded on a gross basis 
if the company is not the primary obligor and does not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above  costco records the net amounts as commissions earned 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in  first out lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company believes the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues 
the company records an adjustment each quarter  if necessary  for the expected annual effect of inflation  and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end 
at august   merchandise inventories valued at lifo approximated fifo after considering the lower of cost or market principle 
at august   merchandise inventories valued using lifo exceeded the comparable fifo value by approximately  due to the aggregate effects of deflation 
the company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales 
the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results  which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the company s fiscal year 
inventory cost  where appropriate  is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable 
other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones  terms of agreement  or other systematic and rational approach 
impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment 
management s judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist  requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs  based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
future circumstances may result in the company s actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates 
insurance self insurance liabilities the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  property damage  director and officers liability  vehicle liability and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions
