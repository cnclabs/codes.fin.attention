total company internal growth first quarter ending august  second quarter ending november  third quarter ending february  fourth quarter ending may  for the year ending may  historically  increases in our internal growth rate have lagged an economic upturn as customers add individuals to existing rental or sales programs or enter into new rental or sales programs 
our internal growth continues to be generated mainly through the continued sale of uniform rental programs to new customers and the increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base 
the remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of first aid  safety and fire protection service businesses and document management businesses

this increase was mainly driven by the growth of the sale of first aid  safety and fire protection products and services and document management services 
growth in these areas continues to be through an increase in the customer base and through further penetration of additional products and services into our existing customer base 
cost of rentals increased over fiscal cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses  delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory  including uniforms  mats  shop towels and other rental items 
the cost increase over fiscal was primarily driven by the growth in rentals segment revenues 
rising oil and fuel costs also contributed to this increase 
various cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year provided a decrease in cost of rentals as a percent to rentals revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal cost of other services increased over fiscal cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly uniforms and first aid products  delivery expenses and distribution expenses 
the increase over fiscal was due to the growth in other services revenue  derived through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
gross margin within this segment generally fluctuates between to  depending on the type of product or service sold 
products which require additional services generate higher gross margins 
the gross margin for fiscal is  which is in the upper portion of that general range  mainly due to a shift in the product mix 
selling and administrative expenses increased over fiscal selling and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher selling expenses 
in order to accelerate revenue growth  we have increased our sales force  marketing plans and sales promotions 
these measures combined to increase our selling costs by approximately million over the prior fiscal year 
the cost of providing medical benefits to our employees also increased approximately million 
the costs of providing medical benefits are anticipated to continue to rise 
net interest expense decreased million from the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily a result of increased interest income due to higher levels of cash and marketable securities throughout the entire year and an increase in the interest rate environment 
pre tax income was million  a increase over fiscal pre tax income from the rentals segment increased over the prior year due to higher rental revenue and various cost containment initiatives  which more than offset the increases in selling expenses and medical costs

accounts receivable increased million due to increased revenues 
accounts receivable also increased due to a loan to an affiliated company 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the board of directors approved and cintas provided a million loan to an affiliated company with specific repayment terms over the next three years 
this affiliated company manufactures a significant portion of cintas mats 
a dividend of million was subsequently received by cintas from this affiliate in the first quarter of fiscal inventories increased million mainly due to increased revenues 
other contributing factors include the continued increase in international sourcing of product  a current conversion of our comfort pant to a new fabric and style  and additional inventory requirements for our uniform book  a large catalog used for the direct sale of uniforms and accessories

internal growth for fiscal  when adjusted for the additional workday in fiscal as compared to fiscal  was 
weakness in employment numbers through the first half of our fiscal year directly affected our business  mainly through reduced uniform wearers and usage of related products  and caused our internal growth rate to be lower than our stated objective

new business remained healthy as we experienced continued success in selling uniform rental programs to new customers 
we continue to expand our rental market  with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs

this decrease was mainly due to the continued difficulty experienced by our uniform direct sale customers in the hospitality and airline industries 
weakness in the hospitality sector and delayed purchases by large national account customers have continued to impact our direct sales effort 
partially offsetting this internal revenue decrease in uniform direct sale revenues were increased revenues from the sale of first aid products and services and document management services 
cost of rentals increased over fiscal cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses  delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory  including uniforms and other rental items 
the cost increase over fiscal was primarily driven by the growth in rentals segment revenues

generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for public entities excluding small business issuers no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  cintas will adopt this statement no later than the first quarter of fiscal cintas is in the process of determining the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on its financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note entitled significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant changes  estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the financial statements 
revenue recognition rental revenue is recognized when services are performed and other services revenue is recognized either when services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 
cintas establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
this allowance is an estimate based on historical rates of collectibility 
an uncollectible accounts provision is recorded for overdue amounts  beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages 
the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rentals and other services segments  because of differences in customers served and the nature of each business segment 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
substantially all inventories represent finished goods 
cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual to standard costs to the inventory balances 
the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market 
inventory obsolescence is determined by specific identification  as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence 
uniforms and other rental items in service uniform and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization  calculated using the straight line method 
uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant garments are amortized over their useful life of eighteen months 
other rental items including shop towels  mats  cleanroom garments  flame resistant garments  linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives of eight to forty eight months 
the amortization rates used are based on industry experience  cintas experience and wear tests performed by cintas 
these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the financial statements 
property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which is typically thirty to forty years for buildings  five to twenty years for building improvements  three to ten years for equipment and two to five years for leasehold improvements 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  the estimated future cash flows undiscounted are compared to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment loss is recorded 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amounts 
fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised values  as appropriate 
long lived assets that are held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value  less estimated costs related to disposition 
goodwill and impairment goodwill  primarily obtained through acquisitions of businesses  is valued at cost less any impairment 
cintas performs annual impairment tests by segment 
these tests include comparisons to current market values  where available  and discounted cash flow analyses 
significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth 
based on the results of the impairment tests  cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the years ended may   or service contracts and other assets service contracts and other assets  which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses  are amortized by use of the straight line method over the estimated lives of the agreements  which are generally five to ten years 
certain noncompete agreements  as well as all service contracts  require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model 
the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates  among other factors 
because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets  actual results over time could vary from original estimates 
impairment of service contracts and other assets is through specific identification 
no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the years ended may   or environmental matters and related litigation cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business 
us generally accepted accounting principles require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
cintas regularly consults with attorneys to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered before a contingent liability is recorded 
while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities  cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the financial statements 
a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed above in the section entitled litigation and other contingencies 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
please reference note entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes 
deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date 
cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  cintas records reserves for probable exposures 
based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions  cintas believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
outlook as we look forward to fiscal  our outlook remains positive  but guarded 
as the economy has strengthened and employment rates have improved  our internal growth rates have also continued to improve 
based on our marketing data  we have a relatively low market share of a billion estimated potential market 
as such  we see upside potential for all of our business units 
although difficult to predict  we anticipate continued growth in all of our business units 
overall performance will be largely driven by external market conditions 
in the marketplace  competition and related pricing pressure will continue  however  we believe cost containment initiatives  technological advances and continued leverage of our infrastructure will soften or offset any impact 
when appropriate opportunities arise  we will supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions 
like most other companies  we experienced  and anticipate continuing to experience  increased costs for wages and benefits  including medical benefits 
changes in oil and fuel costs and changes in federal and state tax laws also have the potential to impact our results 
cintas continues to be the target of a corporate unionization campaign by unite here and the teamsters unions 
these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering our employees rights to a government supervised election and unilaterally accept union representation 
this is unacceptable 
cintas philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward we believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no 
this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect results of operations 
we will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees rights 
we believe that the high level of customer service provided by our partners and supported by our infrastructure  quality products  financial resources and corporate culture will provide for continued business success 
however  a number of factors influence future revenue  margins and profit which make forecasting difficult 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt  marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements 
earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates due to the use of variable rate notes and revolving credit facilities amounting to approximately million  with an average interest rate of 
this exposure is limited by the purchase of marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against variability in short term rates 
if short term rates change by one half percent or basis points  cintas income before taxes would change by approximately million 
this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of marketable securities and swap agreements on the change in the cost of variable rate debt 
this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 
through its foreign operations  cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk 
foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar 
cintas does not currently use forward exchange contracts to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from foreign currency exchange rate movements
