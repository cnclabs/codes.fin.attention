item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
please note that unless otherwise specifically indicated  discussion of our results relate to our continuing operations 
executive summary our business is characterized by a stable customer base resulting in strong cash flow from operations 
we provide the basic service of collection and disposal of non hazardous solid waste that is essential to our customers needs 
competition is driven by local economic and demographic factors as well as fluctuations in capacity utilization  in both the collection and landfill business 
however  the order of magnitude for year over year price and volume changes over the past three years has been less than three percent  positive or negative 
customer service satisfaction levels industry wide are very high since the collection customer has a very low tolerance for poor service 
the stability of our customer base generally drives our operating costs 
labor costs are the most significant of our total operating costs  consistent with our extensive workforce 
the direct cost of disposing of waste at third party sites is the next most significant of our total operating costs 
the cost of disposal of waste at our own landfills is included in individual landfill related operating cost line items 
repair and maintenance costs are also significant and directly relate to the  collection and landfill vehicles and equipment that we operate to service our customer base 
our selling  general and administrative costs are largely predictable since salaries and management incentive compensation represent the most significant part of our selling  general and administrative costs 
depreciation and amortization is split almost evenly between depreciation of the vehicles and equipment used in our operations and the amortization of our landfill assets 
in recent years  our operating costs have grown more quickly than our revenues  resulting in declining operating margins 
we invest a significant amount of capital to support the ongoing operations of our landfill and collection business 
landfills are highly engineered  sophisticated facilities similar to civil works 
each year we invest capital in our active landfills to ensure sufficient capacity to receive the waste volume we handle 
in addition  we have approximately  collection vehicles and over  containers to serve our collection customers 
they endure rough conditions each day and must be routinely maintained and replaced 
cash flows in our business are for the most part fairly predictable as a result of the nature of our customer base 
this predictability helps us to determine our ability to service debt 
knowing this  we have incurred debt to acquire the assets we own and we have paid cash to acquire existing cash flow streams 
this financial model should allow us over time to transfer the enterprise value of the company from debt holders to shareholders as we use our cash flow to repay debt 
we  of course  need to prudently manage our debt to ensure a capital structure that is supportive of our operating plan and to avoid unnecessary risk depending on the varying economic and capital market conditions 
we intend to continue to use cash flow from operations after capital expenditures to reduce our debt balance until we reach credit ratios  that we believe will allow us to benefit from an investment grade like cost of capital 
as this occurs  we believe the relative cost of debt and interest expense should decline 
upon achieving optimal credit ratios we should have the opportunity to choose the best use of any excess cash flow further repay debt  pay a dividend to the extent permitted  repurchase stock or reinvest in growing the size of our company 
we may take advantage of opportunities that arise to accelerate the de leveraging process as long as the opportunities meet our need to maintain our competitive strength 
effective october   charles h 
cotros was appointed chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of the company  succeeding thomas h 
van weelden  who resigned as chairman and chief executive officer of the company on october  and as president of the 
table of contents company on october  mr 
cotros employment agreement currently anticipates he will remain in this position until we complete our search for a permanent chairman and chief executive officer  which we hope to accomplish in effective december   our executive vice president and vice chairman retired 
results of operations 
net income from continuing operations for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to increases in costs of operations and selling  general and administrative expenses  partially offset by increases in revenue and decreases in interest expense 
during  internal revenue growth increased and was driven by increases in both average price per unit and volume 
however  increased costs for vehicle maintenance and costs directly associated with the implementation of standards and best practices across the company were the primary drivers of the decline in operating income 
based on past business cycles  we believe that a stronger economic environment would drive greater volume growth  increase capacity utilization and therefore have a positive impact on average per unit pricing 
we anticipate that most operating costs will continue to increase from normal inflation 
however  we currently expect our employee benefits  fuel and maintenance costs will continue to increase at a rate in excess of inflation 
at the beginning of  we began efforts to design and implement best practice programs throughout our organization 
we believe the investment we are making in implementing best practice programs in the areas of revenue enhancement and operating cost reductions will provide benefits to operating margins and improve the overall business over the long term 
the programs are focused on improving sales productivity and pricing effectiveness  driver productivity through improved routing  maintenance efficiency through standardized operating practices  and reducing our procurement costs through more effective purchasing 
in addition  we are focusing on controlling cost increases associated with safety and our health and welfare programs 
we incurred approximately million of costs associated with the implementation of these programs in the majority of these costs were for third party consultants and internal staffing 
in  we expect these costs to decrease to approximately million for ongoing program support costs 
we expect to be able to produce approximately million of net benefits in  with net annual benefits potentially increasing to approximately million over the long term 
in addition  we plan to increase capital expenditures over the next several years to reduce the average age of our truck fleet which should improve maintenance costs 
in  total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
financing activities 
we continue to focus on maximizing cash flow to repay debt and to seek opportunities to create additional cash flow through reductions in interest cost 
during  we reduced our debt balance by million to billion through the application of cash on our balance sheet at december  and operating cash flow  net of financing costs 
we continue to reduce debt and improve our ratio of debt to total capitalization  which decreased to at the end of from at the end of during  we refinanced billion of debt in the first half of the year  which enabled us to reduce the weighted average interest rate on those borrowings from to approximately and extend maturities from to  and this contributed to the overall reduction of our effective interest rate from at december  to as of december  in connection with these refinancing activities  we paid approximately million in premiums and new debt issuance costs and charged approximately million to interest expense and other for the premiums and the non cash write off of previously deferred financing costs 
in addition  during the last six months of  we redeemed an additional million of our senior subordinated notes due in for million 
in connection with this redemption  we paid premiums of approximately million and wrote off deferred financing costs of million  both of which were recorded as a charge to interest expense and other 

table of contents general revenues 
we generate revenues primarily from fees charged to customers for waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services 
we consider our core business to be our collection  transfer and landfill operations 
we also generate revenue from the sale of recycled commodities 
we record revenue as the services are provided  with revenue deferred in instances where services are billed in advance of the service being provided 
the following table shows our total reported revenues by service line 
intercompany revenues have been eliminated 
revenues by service line in millions year ended december  collection residential commercial roll off recycling total collection disposal landfill transfer total disposal recycling commodity other total revenues consists of revenue generated from commercial  industrial and residential customers from waste collected in roll off containers that are loaded onto collection vehicles 
roll off containers are generally uncovered containers that range in size from to cubic yards 
landfill revenues are presented net of landfill taxes 

table of contents we have organized our operations into nine geographic regions 
our operations are not concentrated in any one geographic region 
our regional teams focus on developing local markets in which we can achieve the greatest level of internalization and operating efficiency 
as a result  we may choose to not operate in a market where our business objectives cannot be met 
at december   we had operations in major markets in states 
we operate only in the united states and puerto rico 
the following table shows our revenues by geographic region in total and as a percentage of total revenues

operating expenses 
cost of operations includes labor expenses  waste disposal at third party disposal facilities  repairs and maintenance  transportation of waste to the disposal site  vehicle operating costs including fuel  landfill operating costs  safety and insurance  and other operating costs such as equipment and facility rent  utilities  environmental compliance and remediation 
approximately of our fuel consumption in was under fixed price purchase contracts 
comparing the market price of fuel to the contracted price of fuel consumed in  the fuel contracts provided benefits for the year of approximately million 
a significant portion of these contracts expire in early landfill operating costs consist of landfill taxes  host community fees  landfill royalty payments  landfill site maintenance and other equipment operating expenses and accretion expense for capping  closure and post closure monitoring liabilities 
reimbursement from third parties  primarily insurance carriers relating to environmental and remedial costs  are included in cost of operations as an offset to environmental expenses

table of contents landfill disposal capacity and operating lives 
we had available disposal capacity of approximately billion tons as of december  we classify this total disposal capacity as either permitted having received the final permit from the governing authorities or probable expansion 
probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the regulatory agencies  but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is highly probable 
our requirements to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows we have control of and access to the land where the expansion permit is being sought 
all geologic and other technical siting criteria for a landfill have been met  or a variance from such requirements has been received or can reasonably be expected to be achieved 
the political process has been assessed and there are no identified impediments that cannot be resolved 
we are actively pursuing the expansion permit and have an expectation that the final local  state and federal permits will be received within the next five years 
senior operations management approval has been obtained 
the following table reflects disposal capacity activity for active landfills we owned or operated for the twelve months ended december  disposal capacity in millions of tons probable total permitted number expansion number total number disposal of disposal of disposal of capacity landfills capacity landfills capacity landfills balance as of december  acquisitions  divestitures and closures additions to probable expansion disposal capacity net change to permitted disposal capacity disposal capacity consumed changes in engineering estimates balance as of december  the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our landfill assets based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes at december  at december  number of sites percent of total number of sites percent of total to years to years to years to years years total

table of contents for the year ended december   revenues increased over the prior year in all major lines of business collection  transfer and disposal 
additionally within the collection business  the residential and roll off revenues increased  while the commercial business showed a slight decrease 
increases in overall revenues were driven by price and volume growth of about each 
the growth in our average per unit price is a result of our continued focus on effective price increases  effectively managing the pricing of our new work and allowing under priced work to be replaced with more profitable work 
volume growth continues to be driven by an overall improvement in the economy  as well as more effective sales practices in the landfill  transfer and collection business 
commodity and other revenue increased primarily due to an increase in the average per unit price for our main recyclable commodities  old corrugated cardboard and paper  as well as a slight increase in recycled volumes 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased in the increase for the year is primarily attributable to i inflationary increases in all costs  ii incremental increases in costs associated with increased volume such as transportation  host fees and landfill operating costs and iii increases in maintenance  landfill operating costs  fuel and transportation costs in excess of inflation 
labor  which represents over of the cost of operations  increased approximately in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in the year ended december  as compared to the increase is primarily attributable to salaries and professional fees 
included in salaries were million of costs associated with an executive departure and our field organization realignment in the fourth quarter of this amount includes approximately million related to the resignation of the chairman and chief executive officer in the fourth quarter of costs associated with professional fees included approximately million on efforts to implement standards and best practices across the company and an increase in professional fees for incremental costs associated with increased corporate governance regulations including sarbanes oxley implementation and labor relations 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in the year ended december  as compared to the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in landfill volume and landfill amortization rates 
interest expense and other 
interest expense and other decreased by in following are the components of interest expense and other in millions for the year ended december  interest expense and other interest expense  gross cash settlement on non hedge accounting interest rate swap contracts interest income interest capitalized for development projects accretion of debt and amortization of debt issuance costs non cash gain on non hedge accounting interest rate swap contracts amortization of accumulated other comprehensive loss for de designated interest rate swap contracts costs incurred to early extinguish debt interest expense allocated to discontinued operations interest expense and other 
table of contents the decrease in gross interest expense and cash settlement on non hedge accounting interest rate swap contracts is attributable primarily to the repayment of debt from our continued de leveraging strategy  the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates and the maturing of higher rate interest rate swap contracts 
during and  we decreased our debt balance by million and million  respectively  and in  we refinanced approximately billion of debt with lower interest rates 
at december   approximately of our debt had fixed rates 
costs incurred to retire debt prior to maturity in include million of premiums and fees paid and million of write offs of financing costs 
these costs were associated with the repurchase of billion of our senior subordinated notes and the redemption of million of senior notes  both of which were due in costs incurred to retire debt prior to maturity in include i million for the write off of deferred financing costs and other costs for the refinancing of our credit facility and ii million in premiums paid and other costs for the open market repurchase of million of senior subordinated notes during the change in non cash gain on non hedge accounting interest rate swap contracts is due to changes in the market value of the underlying interest rate swap contract driven by both changes in prevailing interest rates and the remaining term of the interest rate swap contract 
the decrease in amortization of accumulated other comprehensive loss for de designated interest rate swap contracts is attributable to de designated interest rate swap contracts that matured during income tax expense 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period in the increase is due in part to a decrease in annual earnings before taxes in compared with and an increase in interest provided on the tax contingency described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
minority interest 
we recognized a non recurring minority interest benefit from revised estimates used in the stipulated calculation of certain minority shareholders equity at certain consolidated subsidiaries 
discontinued operations 
certain operations that were divested during and  are reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
during  we sold operations in florida and included a net after tax loss of approximately million in discontinued operations 
also included in the results for discontinued operations for the year ended december  is a net after tax gain of million as a result of purchase price adjustments for operations sold in during  we sold discontinued operations in south carolina  georgia  colorado  new jersey  virginia and florida and included a net after tax loss of approximately million in discontinued operations

dividends on preferred stock decreased by in dividends in include dividends payable in cash relating to series c mandatory convertible preferred stock series c preferred stock issued in april dividends in included dividends related to the series c preferred stock and a non cash dividend on the liquidation preference of our series a senior convertible preferred stock 
the series a senior convertible preferred stock was converted to common stock in december non cash conversion of preferred stock 
in december  the series a senior convertible preferred stock was exchanged for common stock 
in connection with the exchange  we recorded a reduction to net income available to common shareholders of million for the fair value using a common stock price on the date of conversion of of the million incremental shares of common stock issued to the holders of the preferred stock over the amount the holders would have received under the original conversion provisions

excludes amounts reclassified to discontinued operations 
overall  during  we continued to experience pricing pressures as a result of general economic conditions 
landfill revenues increased as a result of a increase in landfill volumes and a slight increase in per unit pricing for when compared to revenue from the collection businesses remained fairly consistent from to with volumes and per unit pricing remaining flat 
commodity revenues increased by million in compared to primarily due to an increase in the average per unit price received for old corrugated cardboard and various grades of paper  our primary commodities  and an increase in processing fees associated with a recycling contract  offset by a decline in commodity volume primarily due to the sale or closure of processing facilities 
additionally  we experienced a decrease in other revenues of million due to an increase in landfill taxes and a decrease in other non core revenues 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased by in the increase is primarily attributable to i inflationary increases in all costs  ii incremental increases in costs associated with increased volumes such as transportation  host fees and landfill operating costs and iii increases in insurance and financial assurance costs in excess of inflation rates 
these cost increases were partially offset by a reduction of million in capping  closure and post closure provision as a result of a change in accounting upon our adoption of sfas and a reduction in other operating expenses from the change in reversals of acquisition related accruals of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by in the increase is primarily due to normal inflationary increases in costs primarily labor related  an increase in pension expense in excess of inflationary increases and an increase in bad debt expense 
the increase in pension expense is primarily attributable to the overall decline in the market value of our pension assets in and and the decrease in the expected long term rate of return from to these cost increases were partially offset by a reduction in other expense from the reversal of acquisition related accruals of million that we determined were no longer necessary 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in landfill amortization 
the adoption of sfas changed our accounting for landfills and resulted in an increase in landfill assets to be amortized and increased landfill volumes  both of which caused the increase in landfill amortization

liquidity and capital resources during  we generated operating cash flows of million  of which we reinvested million of capital into the business 
we reduced our debt balance by million to billion 
during  we completed various refinancing transactions and debt repayments  reducing the weighted average interest rate on approximately billion of borrowings from to we generally meet operational liquidity needs with operating cash flow 
our other liquidity needs are primarily for capital expenditures for vehicles  containers and landfill development  debt service costs  scheduled debt maturities and capping  closure  post closure and environmental expenditures 
when we cannot meet our liquidity needs with operating cash flow  we meet those needs with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we have a billion commitment until under our revolving credit facility  which we believe is adequate to meet our liquidity needs based on current conditions 
at december   we had no loans outstanding and million in letters of credit outstanding on the revolving credit facility  leaving million of availability 
additionally  we have letter of credit capacity of million until under our institutional letter of credit facility to meet letter of credit requirements  in addition to our revolving credit facility  all of which was used at december  we continuously seek opportunities to increase our cash flow through improvements in operations and reducing our interest cost 
historically we have used bank financings and capital markets transactions to meet our refinancing and liquidity requirements 
under our credit facility  we are required to meet certain financial covenants 
our objective is to maintain sufficient surplus between the required covenant ratios and the actual ratios calculated according to the credit agreement 
we monitor the surplus carefully and will take action if the surplus becomes too tight 
we have not historically experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt 
we expect to continue to seek such opportunities in the future to the extent such opportunities are available to us

our capital expenditures are primarily for the construction and build out of our landfills  for the vehicles and containers used by our collection operations and for heavy equipment used in both our collection and landfill operations 
beginning in  we intend to increase the level of capital expenditures to approximately million in order to reduce the average age of our truck fleet and lower repairs and maintenance expense 
we expect to maintain this level of capital spending for the next few years

significant financing events in the following transactions were completed during we repaid our million senior notes due on january  with our cash balance at december  we issued million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due we used the proceeds from the sale of these notes to redeem million of our senior notes due at a redemption price of in february in may  we redeemed the remaining million of the million senior notes due at a redemption price of 
we repurchased million of our senior subordinated notes due using the remaining proceeds from the million senior secured notes issued in november due in april  we funded a new million term loan d due priced at libor plus basis points 
we used the proceeds from the term loan d  along with the proceeds from issuance of the following notes  to repurchase billion of our senior subordinated notes due through the completion of a tender offer and open market repurchases million of senior unsecured notes due  million of senior notes due  and million of senior subordinated convertible debentures due in connection with these financing transactions completed in the first half of  which reduced the weighted average interest rate on approximately billion of borrowings from to  we paid premiums and issuance costs of approximately million million in the first quarter and million in the second quarter and recorded a charge to interest expense and other of approximately million million in the first quarter and million in the second quarter for premiums paid and the non cash write off of deferred financing costs 
the premiums and issuance costs were paid using our revolver borrowings 
in august  we redeemed an additional million of our senior subordinated notes due for million 
in connection with this redemption  we paid premiums and fees of approximately million and wrote off million of deferred financing costs  both of which were recorded as a charge to interest expense and other 
on october  we increased our receivables secured loan program from million to million 
also  as of october  we increased the amount we borrowed under the loan agreement secured by receivables by million and extended the maturity from march to may the loan agreement has a day liquidity facility with a three year purchase commitment  however  we intend to extend the liquidity facility annually 
if we are unable to renew the loan agreement  we would refinance any amounts outstanding with our revolving credit facility 
table of contents which matures in or with other long term borrowings 
although we intend to renew the loan agreement in may and do not expect to repay the amounts within the next twelve months  the loan is classified as a current liability because it has a contractual maturity of less than one year 
in november  we redeemed another million of our senior subordinated notes due for million with the borrowings under our receivables secured loan 
in connection with this redemption  we paid premiums and fees of approximately million and wrote off million of deferred financing costs  both of which were recorded as a charge to interest expense and other 
exchange of series a senior convertible preferred stock on december   we completed the exchange of the series a preferred stock outstanding for million shares of our common stock 
the series a preferred stock had a stated value of billion at december   the exchange date  which represented the original issuance amount plus cumulative accrued and unpaid dividends 
no additional common shares were issued for the increase in liquidation preference from july   the date we reached agreement on the exchange transaction with the holders of the series a preferred stock  through the exchange date 
upon completion of the exchange transaction  our outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis increased to approximately million shares 
as a result of the exchange  approximately million in future annual dividend payments due to begin july have been eliminated 
due to the change in the original conversion terms  we were required to quantify the accounting effect of the change in conversion terms and reduce net income available to common shareholders by the corresponding amount 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash conversion charge of million  which is reflected as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders  but has no effect on total stockholders equity because an offsetting amount is recorded to additional paid in capital 
the non cash conversion charge is calculated as the market value of the shares of our common stock issued in excess of the shares of common stock that the holders of the series a preferred stock could have converted into under the original terms of the series a preferred stock 
financing plan we are a highly leveraged company with billion of outstanding debt at december  the vast majority of our debt was incurred to acquire solid waste companies during the past years 
we incurred and assumed over billion of debt to acquire browning ferris industries  inc bfi in since the acquisition of bfi  we have repaid debt with cash flow from operations  asset sales and the issuance of equity 
we intend to continue to reduce our debt balance until we reach credit ratios that we believe will allow us to benefit from an investment grade like cost of capital 
we believe those benefits will be realized when the following ratios approach the indicated ranges debt to ebitda between and ebitda to interest between and debt to book value market capitalization between and we are unable to predict or forecast which debt rating will be assigned by the rating agencies  or when new ratings will be assigned by them 
we believe that as we move towards these ratios  when compared to today  we will have additional opportunities to reduce our cost of debt below our current level  provide opportunities to increase liquidity  and allow more flexibility in deciding the most appropriate use of our cash flow 
until then  we will continue to manage operating cash flows and capital expenditures to facilitate repayment of our scheduled debt maturities and opportunistically reduce interest costs through refinancing transactions to the extent economically beneficial 
examples include the refinancing of 
table of contents billion of our senior subordinated notes due and the other refinancing transactions in and we believe that we will continue to generate cash flow from operations after funding capital expenditures to be used to repay debt 
in the future  we expect to continue to acquire operations that strengthen existing markets and increase vertical integration 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate the performance of and opportunities to divest operations that do not maximize operating efficiencies or provide an adequate return on invested capital 
we may continue to seek opportunities to extend our maturities in the future with actions that are economically beneficial 
we believe we have several alternatives available to us to extend maturities of our debt portfolio or retire debt 
the potential alternatives include continued application of cash flow from operations  asset sales and capital markets transactions 
capital markets transactions could include issuance of debt with longer term maturities  issuance of equity  or a combination of both 
there is no assurance that in the future we will be able to i consummate transactions in the capital markets on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  ii sell assets or iii generate annual cash flows to repay debt 
we are currently reviewing opportunities in the credit and capital markets to refinance certain components of our capital structure  including certain loans under our credit facility and other fixed rate notes 
our objectives are to extend near term maturities  increase financial capacity  reduce interest rates  and improve financial covenants 
in addition  we are examining opportunities to retire certain high cost debt to improve cash flow and reduce financial leverage 
opportunities being reviewed include accessing both debt and equity markets 
there are no assurances that a refinancing or any such transactions will be consummated 
we currently have effective shelf registration statements with the sec that would allow us to issue various securities up to billion as market conditions permit

in addition  we had an institutional letter of credit facility of million available under the credit facility  all of which was used for letters of credit outstanding 
the receivables secured loan is a day liquidity facility 
on october   we increased our receivables secured loan by million and extended the maturity from march to may at that time  we intend to renew the liquidity facility 
if we are unable to renew the loan agreement  we would refinance any amounts outstanding with our revolving credit facility which matures in or with other long term borrowings 
although we intend to renew the loan agreement in may and do not expect to repay the amounts within the next twelve months  the loan is classified as a current liability because it has a contractual maturity of less than one year 

table of contents the following table outlines what we regard as our material  fixed  non cancelable contractual cash obligations  their payment dates and expirations 
amounts related to operating leases and purchase obligations are not recorded as a liability on our december  consolidated balance sheet and will be recorded as appropriate in future periods 
this table excludes certain obligations that we have reflected on our consolidated balance sheet  such as pension obligations  for which we do not expect to have cash funding requirements and excludes amounts related to environmental liabilities and contingencies for which the timing of payments is not determinable

scheduled interest payment obligations are calculated using stated coupons for fixed debt and interest rates effective as of december  for variable rate debt 
the current portion of other long term obligations is not reflected here  as it is included in the other accrued liabilities balance 
purchase obligations consist primarily of i disposal related agreements which include fixed or minimum royalty and host agreements and take or pay and put or pay disposal agreements  and ii other obligations including a fuel contract agreement  committed capital expenditures  and consulting services arrangements 
debt covenants 
our credit facility and the indentures relating to our senior subordinated notes and our senior notes contain financial covenants and restrictions on our ability to complete acquisitions  pay dividends  incur indebtedness  make investments and take certain other corporate actions 

table of contents under the credit facility  our primary financial covenants are minimum interest coverage through the ebitda from the quarter ending quarter ending interest december  march  x june  september  x december  december  x march  june  x september  september  x december  december  x march  march  x june  june  x september  march  x june  june  x september  september  x december  thereafter x maximum leverage through the total debt from the quarter ending quarter ending ebitda march  june  x september  december  x march  june  x september  september  x december  december  x march  december  x march  june  x september  thereafter x at december   we were in compliance with these and all other financial covenants under our credit facility and our indentures 
at december   total debt ebitda ratio  as defined by the credit facility  was and our ebitda interest ratio was we are not subject to any minimum net worth covenants and we have no required minimum credit rating triggers 
ebitda used for covenants is calculated in accordance with the definition in our credit facility agreement 
in this context  ebitda is used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants 
failure to comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility  as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events  would constitute a default under the credit agreement and would allow the lenders under the credit facility to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the credit agreement 
in addition  maturity acceleration on the credit facility constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments  including our senior notes and our senior subordinated notes and  therefore  these would also be subject to acceleration of maturity 
if such acceleration of maturities of indebtedness were to occur  we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness 
we would likely have to seek an amendment under the credit facility for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity  and or asset sales  if necessary 
we may be unable to 
table of contents amend the credit facility or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 
prepayments 
under our credit facility  we must repay a portion of our borrowings annually prior to the stated maturity if we generate cash flow in excess of specified levels 
to make these payments  if required  we may have to use the revolver to accommodate cash timing differences 
factors primarily causing excess cash flow  as defined  could include increases in operating cash flow  lower capital expenditures and working capital requirements  net divestitures or other favorable cash generating activities 
in addition  we are required to make prepayments on the credit facility upon completion of certain transactions as defined in the credit facility  including asset sales and issuances of debt or equity securities 
financial assurances 
we are required to provide financial assurances to governmental agencies under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping  closure and post closure costs  and performance under certain collection  landfill and transfer station contracts 
we satisfy the financial assurance requirements by providing performance bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits 
the amount of the financial assurance requirement for capping  closure and post closure costs is determined by the applicable state environmental regulations  which vary by state 
the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs can either be for costs associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill 
generally  states will require a third party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping  closure and post closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill 
the amount of financial assurances required can  and generally will  differ from the obligation determined and recorded under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
additionally  we are required to provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral required for certain performance obligations 
we do not expect a material increase in financial assurances during  although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 
at december   we had the following financial assurance instruments in place in millions landfill closure contract risk casualty collateral for post closure performance insurance obligations total insurance policies surety bonds trust deposits letters of credit total these amounts are issued under the revolver and the institutional letter of credit facility under our credit facility 
these financial assurance instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not debt of the company 
since we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments  they are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
however  we have recorded capping  closure and post closure liabilities and self insurance as the liabilities are incurred under generally accepted accounting principles 
the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments would be valued and recorded in the consolidated financial statements if it is probable that we would be unable to perform our obligations under the financial assurance contracts 
we do not expect this to occur 

table of contents off balance sheet financing we have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations  other than financial assurance instruments discussed above and operating leases  which are not classified as debt 
we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed  consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position 
we do not guarantee any third party debt 
interest rate swap portfolio we have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging variability of interest expense and interest payments on our long term variable rate bank debt and maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
our strategy is to use interest rate swap contracts when such transactions will serve to meet the objectives of our risk management policy 
these contracts are not entered into for trading purposes 
our risk management policy requires that we evaluate the credit of our counter parties and that we monitor counter party exposure 
at december   counter parties for our interest rate swap portfolio were rated aa as a result of swap maturities and terminations during  our interest rate swap portfolio fixes of our variable rate interest payment obligation  protecting us from cash flow variations arising from changes in short term interest rates 
we believe this is prudent given our capital structure 
in  we changed our corporate policy to require that no less than of our total debt be effectively fixed  either directly or through interest rate swap agreements 
prior to the change  the minimum fixed rate policy was 
at december   approximately of our debt was fixed  directly  and through an interest rate swap agreement 
in the fourth quarter of  we terminated all swaps where we paid a variable rate and received fixed payments 
the average interest rate paid under our swap contract at december  was compared to libor of at december  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative and hedging activities  a portion of our interest rate swap portfolio was de designated for hedge accounting purposes at december   all of which matured by june  at the time debt obligations are repaid prior to maturity  we may or may not terminate interest rate swap contracts depending on the reflective economic considerations 
as of december   the company had a floating to fixed interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of million 
this contract will mature in march based on the current maturity schedule of our interest rate swap contract  our current debt balance and assuming the interest rate swap contract is not replaced  we expect that at the end of the first quarter of we will have approximately of our debt at fixed interest rates 
contingencies on august   august   and september   three putative class action lawsuits were filed against us and four of our current and former officers in the us district court for the district of arizona 
the lawsuits were consolidated into a single action on november  on january   the court entered an order appointing lead plaintiffs but to date  no consolidated suit has been filed 
the complaints assert claims against all defendants under section b of the securities exchange act of and rule b promulgated thereunder and claims against the officers under section a of the securities exchange act 
the complaints allege that from february   to july   the defendants caused false and misleading statements to be issued in our public filings and public statements regarding our anticipated second quarter results 
the lawsuits seek an unspecified amount of damages 
this action is in its early stages and we are not able to 
table of contents determine whether the outcome will have a material adverse affect on our consolidated results of operations 
we intend to defend the action vigorously 
we are currently under examination by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years  including federal income tax audits for calendar years through a federal income tax audit for bfi s tax years ended september  through july  is complete with the exception of the matter discussed below 
prior to our acquisition of bfi on july   bfi operating companies  as part of a risk management initiative to effectively manage and reduce costs associated with certain liabilities  contributed assets and existing environmental and self insurance liabilities to six fully consolidated bfi risk management companies rmcs in exchange for stock representing a minority ownership interest in the rmcs 
subsequently  the bfi operating companies sold that stock in the rmcs to third parties at fair market value which resulted in a capital loss of approximately million for tax purposes  calculated as the excess of the tax basis of the stock over the cash proceeds received 
on january   the internal revenue service irs designated this type of transaction and other similar transactions as a potentially abusive tax shelter under irs regulations 
during  the irs proposed the disallowance of all of this capital loss 
the primary argument advanced by the irs for disallowing the capital loss was that the tax basis of the stock of the rmcs received by the bfi operating companies was required to be reduced by the amount of liabilities assumed by the rmcs even though such liabilities were contingent and  therefore  not liabilities recognized for tax purposes 
under the irs view  there was no capital loss on the sale of the stock since the tax basis of the stock should have approximately equaled the proceeds received 
we protested the disallowance to the appeals office of the irs in august if the proposed disallowance is upheld  we estimate it could have a potential total cash impact of up to million for federal and state taxes plus accrued interest through december  of approximately million million net of tax benefit 
we also received a notification from the irs proposing a penalty of of the additional income tax resulting from the disallowance 
because of several meritorious defenses  we believe the successful assertion of penalties is unlikely 
we expect that sometime in the first half of  the appeals office of the irs will uphold the disallowance of the capital loss deduction 
if this occurs  we would most likely litigate the matter in a federal court and we would be required to pay a deficiency of approximately million for bfi tax years prior to the acquisition 
thereafter  it would likely take a couple of years before the court reached a decision and it is likely that the losing party would appeal the decision to a court of appeals 
a settlement  however  could occur at any time during the litigation process 
the remaining tax years affected by the capital loss issue are currently being audited by the irs 
a court decision on the litigation would resolve the issue in these years as well 
if we were to win the case  the initial payment would be refunded to us  subject to an appeal 
if we were to lose the case  the deficiency associated with the remaining tax years would be due 
we continue to believe our position is well supported 
however  the potential tax and interest but not penalties impact of a disallowance has been fully reserved on our consolidated balance sheet 
also  the million payment noted above has been reclassified from long term liabilities to current liabilities 
therefore  with regard to tax and accrued interest through december   a disallowance would have minimal impact on our consolidated results of operations 
the periodic accrual of additional interest charged through the time at which this matter is resolved will continue to affect consolidated results of operations 
in addition  the successful assertion by the irs of penalties could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated liquidity  financial position and results of operations 

table of contents in the normal course of conducting our landfill operations  we are involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to the process of obtaining and defending the permits that allow us to operate our landfills 
in june  neighboring parties and the county drainage district filed a lawsuit seeking to prevent bfi from obtaining a vertical elevation expansion permit at one of our landfills in texas 
in  the expansion permit was granted 
the parties opposing the expansion permit continued to pursue their efforts in preventing the expansion permit 
in november  a judgment issued by a state trial court in texas effectively revoked the expansion permit that was granted by the texas commission on environmental quality in and required us to operate the landfill according to a prior permit granted in we have appealed their decision to the texas court of appeals 
operationally  if necessary  we will attempt to obtain bonding that will allow us to continue to operate the landfill as usual during the period of appeals  which may continue two years or longer 
if the appeal is not successful  the landfill may become impaired  we may incur costs to relocate waste to another landfill and this matter could result in a charge of up to million to our consolidated statement of operations 
we enter into contracts in the normal course of business that include indemnification clauses 
indemnifications relating to known liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial statements based on our best estimate of required future payments 
certain of these indemnifications relate to contingent events or occurrences  such as the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in the tax law or adverse interpretation of the tax law  and indemnifications made in divestiture agreements where we indemnify the buyer for liabilities that may become known in the future but that relate to our activities prior to the divestiture 
as of december   we estimate the contingent obligations associated with these indemnifications to be de minimus 
subtitle d and other regulations that apply to the non hazardous solid waste disposal industry have required us  as well as others in the industry  to alter operations and to modify or replace pre subtitle d landfills 
such expenditures have been and will continue to be substantial 
further regulatory changes could accelerate expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently reserved for such purposes 
these factors  together with the other factors discussed above  could substantially increase our operating costs and our ability to invest in our facilities

critical accounting judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these judgments and estimates often involve future events 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
in addition  management has discussed these accounting policies and judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors 
no one geographic operating segment has a more significant concentration of the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the time they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting judgments and estimates are based on our accounting practices in effect during we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent for these areas that you should be aware of and for you to consider 
residual accounting and business risk is defined as the inherent risk that remains after the application of our policies and processes and is generally outside of our control 
accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk landfill accounting our landfill investments fall into two categories  each of which require accounting judgments and estimates 
landfill development asset and related amortization 
landfill retirement obligation asset resulting from recording our capping  closure and post closure liabilities and related amortization 
landfill operations are treated as a period expense and are not discussed herein 
we use the life cycle accounting method for landfills and the related capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
in life 
table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk cycle accounting  all capitalizable costs to acquire  develop and retire a site are recorded to amortization expense based upon the consumption of disposal capacity 
the cost of the assets and liabilities related to landfills is driven by the technical design that is developed by a third party consultant and approved by a regulatory agency 
the technical design includes the construction  capping and closure specifications  the types and quantities of materials required and determination of the landfill capacity 
estimates of future landfill disposal capacity are updated periodically at least annually based on third party surveys 
landfill development asset and related amortization site permit and technical design in order to develop  construct and operate a landfill  we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local  state and federal level 
the permitting process requires an initial siting study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations 
the studies are typically prepared by third party consultants and reviewed by our environmental management group 
the initial studies are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes in the landfill site permitting process 
these changes could make it more difficult or costly to obtain a landfill permit 
studies performed by third parties could be inaccurate which could result in the revocation of a permit 
conditions could exist that were not identified in the study which make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the revocation of a permit 
revocation of a permit could materially impair the recorded value of the landfill asset 
actions by neighboring parties  private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain permits could result in revocation or suspension of a permit which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could materially impair the recorded value of the landfill 
technical landfill design changes in legislative or 
table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk upon receipt of initial regulatory approval  technical landfill designs are prepared 
these designs are compiled by third party consultants and reviewed by our environmental management group 
the technical designs include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required 
the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
upon approval of the technical design  the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 
regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical design 
these changes could make it more difficult or costly to meet new design standards 
technical design requirements  as approved  may need modifications at some future point in time 
third party designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs or difficulty in obtaining a permit 
landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are the factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill 
these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed  the depth of excavation  the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side slope construction 
the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards 
this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on an average expected density to be achieved over the operating life of the landfill 
estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements 
the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions  including waste compaction practices  site design  climate and the nature of the waste 
development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation  natural and synthetic liners  leachate collection system construction  installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site 
we review the adequacy of our cost estimates used in the annual update of the above costs by comparing estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements  review changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness  and compare our resulting development actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the impact from general economic conditions on the availability of the required materials and labor 
technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions  regulatory changes or legislative changes 

table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk cost per acre with prior periods 
these development costs  together with any costs incurred to acquire  design and permit the landfill  including capitalized interest  are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 
landfill development asset amortization in order to match the amortization of the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations  we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill 
at the end of a landfill s operating life  the landfill asset is fully amortized 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill net book value and estimated future development costs as described above of the landfill by the estimated remaining disposal capacity 
the costs are not inflated and discounted  but rather expressed in nominal dollars 
this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill and recorded as a charge to amortization expense 
amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis for the landfill  including acquisition costs  which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values 
we have secured significant landfill assets through business acquisitions in recent years and valued them at the time of acquisition based upon market value 
also  per ton rates are influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors 
increases and decreases in our cost estimates and changes in disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates on a prospective basis 
an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in an asset impairment 
estimate updates on at least an annual basis  we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill 
these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually 
changes in the cost estimates are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 

table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk capping  closure and post closure liabilities we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills capping and closure and post closure monitoring 
landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity  we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit 
these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill siting process described above 
capping activities primarily include installation of liners  drainage  compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total disposal capacity has been consumed and waste is no longer being received 
there are multiple capping activities that occur over the operating life of the landfill 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in capping  closure activities or post closure monitoring activities  types and quantities of materials used  or term of post closure care could cause changes in our cost estimates 
closure and post closure monitoring closure costs are any costs incurred after a site stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed and enters its post closure monitoring period 
after the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is closed  we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period  which generally extends for a period of years 
post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and monitoring the methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems  and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste 
costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling  analysis and statistical reports  third party labor associated with gas systems operations and maintenance  transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 
landfill retirement obligation asset amortization estimates of the total future costs required actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing  causing 
table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk to cap  close  and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are developed annually 
the estimates include the specific timing of the estimated future cash outflows  considering the anticipated waste flow into the capping events and the landfill 
our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually was used in both and 
capping  closure and post closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using the credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 
the present value of the remaining capping costs for a specific capping event and the remaining closure and post closure costs for the landfill are accrued as incurred on a per ton basis 
these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 
a corresponding retirement obligation asset is recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
the retirement obligation asset is amortized to expense on a per ton basis as disposal capacity is consumed 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the recorded retirement obligation asset net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity relating to that event 
closure and post closure per ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 
the recorded retirement obligation is increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the same credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liability 
this accretion expense is charged to cost of operations 
actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liability as they are incurred 
differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
changes in future inflation rate projections could impact our actual future costs and our total liability 
changes in our capital structure could result in changes to the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount the liabilities  which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities and expense 
change in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow  cost estimates or the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations as new information becomes available 
this could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense 
rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design  post closure monitoring requirements  or the inflation or discount rate 

table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk estimate updates on an annual basis  we update the estimate of future capping  closure and post closure costs and estimates of future disposal capacity for each landfill 
revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities and corresponding retirement obligation asset 
changes in the asset result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills which are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 
disposal capacity as described previously  disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit obtained 
we classify this disposal capacity as permitted 
we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates  which relates to additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion 
probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the regulatory agencies  but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is highly probable 
our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows we have control of and access to the land where the expansion permit is being sought 
all geologic and other technical siting criteria for a landfill have been met or a variance from such requirements has been received or can reasonably be expected to be achieved 
the political process has been assessed and there are no identified impediments that cannot be resolved 
we are actively pursuing the expansion we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local  state or federal permit or due to other unknown reasons 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity  or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated  both costs and disposal capacity will change  which will generally increase the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure accruals 
an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could cause an asset impairment 

table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk permit and have an expectation that the final local  state and federal permits will be received within the next five years 
senior operations management approval has been obtained 
after successfully meeting these criteria  the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates 
additionally  for purposes of calculating the landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure rates  we include the incremental costs to develop  construct  close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 
environmental liabilities nature of liabilities liabilities arise from contamination existing at our landfills or at third party landfills that we or a predecessor company have delivered or transported waste to and are based on our estimates of future costs that we will incur for incremental remediation activities and the related litigation costs 
to determine our ultimate liability at these sites  we have used third party environmental engineers and attorneys to assist in the evaluation of several factors  including the extent of contamination at each identified site and the most appropriate remedy 
we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
the majority of our environmental liabilities are obligations that we assumed in connection with an acquisition 
any increases in the assumed accruals for environmental liabilities from the amounts recorded by the predecessor are charged to operating expense 
if the liabilities arise through the normal course of business  the accruals are also charged to operating expense 
actual settlement of these liabilities could differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties  such as the extent of contamination at a particular site  the final remedy  the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties 
actual amounts could differ from the estimated liability as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution including both legal and remedial costs 
an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to operating expense 
estimate updates we periodically consult with outside legal counsel and environmental engineers to 
table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk review the status of all environmental matters and to assist our environmental and legal management in updating our estimates of the likelihood and amounts of remediation 
as the timing of cash payments for these liabilities is uncertain  the accrued costs are not discounted 
any changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recorded to operating income in the period in which the change in estimate is made 
summary we have determined that the recorded liability for environmental matters as of december  and of approximately million and million  respectively  represents the most probable outcome of these contingent matters 
cash paid for environmental matters during and was million and million  respectively 
we do not expect that adjustments to estimates  which are reasonably possible in the near term and that may result in changes to recorded amounts  will have a material effect on our consolidated liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
however  we believe that it is reasonably possible the ultimate outcome of environmental matters  excluding capping  closure and post closure could result in approximately million of additional liability 
due to the nature of these matters  the cash flow impact would not be immediate and would most likely be over a period greater than five years 
non recurring acquisition accruals nature of liabilities at the time of an acquisition accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  we evaluate and record liabilities of the acquired company to represent our estimate of fair value 
assumed liabilities as well as liabilities resulting directly from the completion of the acquisition are there could be changes in circumstances or estimates that cause the actual settlement of these liabilities to be higher or lower than our original estimates 
additional liabilities may exist 
table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk considered in the net assets acquired and resulting purchase price allocation 
related to the acquired operations that have not been identified 
liabilities resulting from changes in estimates of assumed obligations  including litigation  self insurance reserves and loss contracts  as well as liabilities related to restructuring and abandonment activities  are accrued through a charge to expense 
additionally  transition costs that are not accruable at the time of acquisition  including transitional personnel costs  route restructurings and costs associated with the consolidation of operations are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred 
estimate updates we evaluate the adequacy of the non recurring acquisition accruals at least annually by obtaining third party actuarial valuations of assumed self insurance obligations  third party legal counsel updates for assumed litigation and field and corporate management reviews of all acquisition related commitments 
any changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate is made 
the adjustment is charged to either an expense or goodwill consistent with how the original liability was established and the period of time that has elapsed since the date of the acquisition 
generally  we do not record adjustments to goodwill after one year from the date of the acquisition 
summary at december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of non recurring acquisition accruals remaining on our balance sheet  consisting primarily of loss contracts  litigation and compliance  and risk management and insurance liabilities associated with the acquisition of bfi 
cash paid against non recurring acquisition accruals  including severance  in was million and million 
table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk in self insurance liabilities and related costs we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability  automobile liability  and workers compensation insurance and are fully self insured for employee group health claims 
deductible levels are between million and million 
the retained or non insured portion of the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is reflected in our balance sheet as an accrued liability 
the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses for commercial general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation is actuarially determined by a third party actuary 
we use a third party administrator to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation 
the expense is charged to operating costs 
the actuarially determined liability is calculated for the most part by our past claims experience factor  which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million of self insurance liabilities on our balance sheet 
our recorded liabilities are not discounted 
cash paid for self insurance claims during and was million and million  respectively 
incident rates  including frequency and severity  could increase or decrease during a year causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to increase or decrease 
the costs to discharge our obligations  including legal costs and health care costs  could increase or decrease causing current and or prior estimates of our self insurance liability to change 
loss contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess potential liability 
management s assessment is developed in consultation with our outside counsel and other actual costs can vary from estimates for a variety of reasons 
for example  the costs from settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws  opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally 
table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
generally  we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 
involve business matters that are by nature unpredictable 
if a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for significant amounts  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such judgment or settlement occurs 
receivable realization allowance we provide services to approximately million customers throughout the united states 
we perform credit evaluations for our significant customers and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our receivables  payment performance factors  historical trends and other information 
in general  we reserve of receivables outstanding to days and of those outstanding over days 
we also review specific outstanding accounts and reserve the receivable if information becomes available indicating we will not receive payment and consider the recoverability of written off accounts 
our reserve is evaluated and revised on a monthly basis 
we also reserve a portion of revenues as a sales valuation allowance 
we measure this allowance based on our historical analysis of revenue reversals and credits issued after the month of billing 
revenue reversals and credits typically relate to resolution of customer disputes and billing adjustments 
adverse changes in the financial health of our customers could change the timing or levels of collections and require adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
asset impairment valuation methodology we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets 
evaluation criteria we test long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s if we have changes in events or circumstances  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest of certain assets  certain assets could be impaired which would result in a non cash charge to earnings 
our most significant asset 
table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset  a change in its physical condition  or new circumstances that would cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recognition criteria if such circumstances arise  we recognize an impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset  if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
we use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 
impairment exposure  other than goodwill see discussion below is our investment in landfills 
a reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a result of unanticipated events could trigger an impairment charge 
goodwill impairment valuation methodology we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on fair value of each geographic operating segment 
our geographic operating segment is an aggregate of several vertically integrated businesses with similar operational characteristics 
we estimate fair value based on net cash flows discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital which was approximately in in addition  consideration is also given to an earnings multiple approach  enterprise value and overall company market capitalization as indicators of the reasonableness of our discounted cash flows 
evaluation criteria annually  we test realizability of goodwill 
in addition  we test goodwill for recoverability between annual evaluations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a the estimated fair value could change as there are future changes in our capital structure  cost of debt  interest rates  ability to perform at levels that were forecasted  actual capital expenditure levels  or our market capitalization 
for example  a reduction in long term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value to below carrying value  which would trigger an impairment charge 
similarly  an increase in our weighted average cost of capital could trigger an impairment charge 

table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk significant adverse change in legal factors  liquidity or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  or new circumstances that would cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of an operating segment or a significant portion of a geographic operating segment 
recognition criteria we recognize an impairment if the net book value exceeds the fair value as determined using discounted future cash flows on a geographic operating segment basis 
at the time of a divestiture of an individual business unit within a geographic operating segment  goodwill is allocated to that business unit based on the relative fair value of the unit being disposed to the total reporting unit and a gain or loss on disposal is derived 
subsequently  the remaining goodwill in the geographic operating segment from which the assets were divested is re evaluated for impairment  which could also result in an additional loss 
summary at december  and  we had billion and billion  respectively  of goodwill recorded 
at december  and  there was no impairment of goodwill upon completion of our annual evaluation of goodwill recoverability 
in the past  we have incurred non cash losses on sales of assets driven primarily by the goodwill allocated to the assets divested 
if similar divestiture decisions are made in the future  we could incur additional non cash losses on asset sales 
a divestiture of any individual asset below the geographic operating segment level could result in a loss 
tax accruals we account for income taxes using a balance sheet approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences in financial reporting and income tax basis of assets  other than non deductible goodwill  and liabilities 
the differences are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we utilize outside experts and legal counsel to assist in the development or review of significant tax positions used in establishing our liability 
the balance sheet classification and amount of the tax accounts established relating to acquisitions are based on certain assumptions that could possibly change based on the ultimate outcome of certain tax matters 
as these tax accounts were established in purchase accounting  any future changes relating to these amounts will result in balance sheet reclassifications  which may include an adjustment to goodwill 

table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets including net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the future deduction giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
we record liabilities for actual or expected probable tax adjustments proposed or expected by tax authorities at the federal and state level 
the acquisition of bfi in  which was accounted for as a business purchase combination  resulted in approximately billion of goodwill  billion of which amortization is non deductible for tax purposes 
at december   approximately billion of non deductible goodwill remains on our balance sheet 
income tax expense is recorded on an interim basis based on the expected annual effective tax rate and discrete period items 
the annual effective tax rate is determined using estimated full year earnings  non deductible items and tax credits that are anticipated to be utilized 
changes in estimated realizability of deferred tax assets could result in adjustments to income tax expense 
we are currently under examination by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years 
the internal revenue code and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we are required to interpret and apply to our transactions 
positions taken in tax years under examination are subject to challenge 
accordingly  we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken are disallowed by the taxing authorities 
see note of our consolidated financial statements included herein 
summary as of december   state net operating loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards with an after tax benefit totaling million remain unused that will expire if not used by the end of various future years 
valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that some of these carryforwards may not be used 
actual income tax rates can vary from period to period as a result of differences between estimated and actual earnings  non deductible items and tax credit utilization 
an increase or decrease in the tax rate could have a material impact on our results of operations 
defined benefit pension plans recognition criteria our defined benefit retirement plan was assumed in connection with the acquisition of bfi 
the benefits of approximately of the current plan participants were frozen upon acquisition 
the benefit obligation and associated income or expense is actuarially 
table of contents accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk determined by an independent third party based on actuarial assumptions we believe are reasonable 
we use a third party to administer the plan and maintain certain data that is provided to the actuary 
the plan assets are managed by a third party that is unaffiliated to our actuary 
we recognize in our financial statements an accrued liability or a prepaid pension expense  for the difference between the cost to satisfy our pension obligation and the investment income earned or contributions to the plan 
pension income or expense is recorded to selling  general and administrative expense 
our funding policy is to make annual contributions to the pension plan as determined to be required by the plan s actuary and to meet the minimum requirements of the employee retirement income security act erisa 
no contributions were required during the last three years 
no contributions are anticipated for the plan s policy is to invest the plan s assets as determined by our benefits committee 
at december   of the total plan assets of million  approximately was invested in fixed income bond funds and approximately in equity funds 
assumptions the assumptions used in the actuarially determined funded status are as follows weighted average assumptions as of our measurement date  september changes in our investment mix and performance of the equity and bond markets and of fund managers could impact the amount of pension income or expense recorded  the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions

the expected return on our plan assets represents a long term view of returns based on our current asset mix

decrease the funded status of the plan 
if actual return on plan assets varies from the expected returns  the fair value of the plan assets will differ from our projections 
the average rate of compensation increase applies only to the portion of the plan that is not frozen 
less than of the plan participants continue to earn benefits 
this rate reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the period benefits are earned 
we annually review our actual asset allocation  discount rate  expected rate of return and other actuarial assumptions and adjust them as deemed necessary 
changes in our key assumptions could cause changes in our assets  liabilities and income or expense recorded 
for example  a decrease in the discount rate would result in a greater benefits obligation in future periods 
a lower expected return on assets would also increase the amount of pension expense recorded

all phases of our operations are subject to a number of uncertainties  risks and other influences  many of which are outside of our control and any one of which  or a combination of which  could materially affect the results of our operations 
important factors that could cause actual results to 
table of contents differ materially from our expectations are discussed below 
these risks and uncertainties include  without limitation our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to service our debt and operate our business 
we have had and will continue to have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness with significant debt service requirements 
at december   our consolidated debt was approximately billion and our debt to total capitalization was 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns in our industry  increase our vulnerability to interest rate increases to the extent any of our variable rate debt is not hedged  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry  limit  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds or obtain other financing capacity  and subject us to a greater risk of noncompliance with financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness 
the failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material negative effect on us 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
as of december   our debt agreements permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness under various financial ratio tests 
as of december   we had no loans outstanding under the billion revolver of the credit facility 
as of such date  we had million in letters of credit outstanding on that revolver that support financial assurance purposes  leaving million of availability 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash flow in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may also need to refinance our senior notes  our senior subordinated notes and or other indebtedness to pay the principal amounts due at maturity 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
covenants in our credit facility  our indentures and the instruments governing our other indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business 
our credit facility  and certain of the agreements governing our other indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless we satisfy certain financial 
table of contents tests or other criteria 
we must also comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests 
the credit facility financial ratio tests assume that over time ebitda increases and interest decreases in relation to debt levels 
if ebitda does not increase and if interest does not decrease in relation to debt and if we are unable to renegotiate the covenants  we would not comply with the provisions of the credit facility see debt covenants in contractual obligations and commitments 
in some cases  our subsidiaries are subject to similar restrictions which may restrict their ability to make distributions to us 
our credit facility and these other agreements contain additional affirmative and negative covenants  including limitation on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to make acquisitions and capital expenditures 
all of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions  we could be in default under our credit facility and other debt agreements and the debt  together with accrued interest  could then be declared immediately due and payable 
if we default under our credit facility  the lenders could cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under such credit facility to become due and payable  require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness under such credit facility or prevent us from making debt service payments on any other indebtedness we owe 
if we are unable to repay any borrowings when due  the lenders under our credit facility could proceed against their collateral  which includes most of the assets we own  including the stock and assets of our subsidiaries 
in addition  any default under our credit facility or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under our other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
our ability to comply with these provisions of our credit facility and other agreements governing our other indebtedness may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
our bond ratings could be downgraded 
although reductions in our bond ratings may not have an immediate impact on the cost of debt or our liquidity  they may impact the cost of debt and liquidity over the near to medium term 
if our bond ratings are reduced  future access at a reasonable cost to the debt and financial assurance markets may be adversely impacted 
we compete with large companies and municipalities that may have greater financial and operational resources 
we also compete with the use of alternatives to landfill disposal in part because of state requirements to reduce landfill disposal and we cannot assure you that we will continue to operate our landfills at currently estimated volumes 
the non hazardous waste collection and disposal industry is highly competitive 
we compete with large companies and municipalities which may have greater financial and operational resources 
the non hazardous waste collection and disposal industry is led by three large national waste management companies allied  waste management  inc  and republic services  inc 
it also includes numerous regional and local companies 
many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax exempt financing and may control the disposal of waste collected within their jurisdictions 
we encounter competition due to the use of alternatives to landfill disposal  such as recycling and incineration  because of state requirements to reduce landfill disposal and we cannot ensure that our landfills will continue to operate at currently estimated volumes 
further  most of the states or municipalities in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning  composting and recycling or other programs 
some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes  such as yard wastes  at landfills 
these actions may reduce the volume of waste going to landfills in certain areas 
if this occurs  there can be no assurances that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current estimated volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for services 

table of contents if we are unable to execute our business strategy  our waste disposal expenses could increase significantly 
over the long term  our ability to continue to sustain our current vertical integration strategy will depend on our ability to maintain appropriate landfill capacity  collection operations and transfer stations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to replace such assets either timely or cost effectively or integrate acquisition candidates effectively or profitably 
further  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in expanding the permitted capacity of our current landfills once our landfill capacity is full 
in such event  we may have to dispose of collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to another of our landfills  either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal expenses 
we may be unable to obtain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain the permits we require to operate our business because permits to operate non hazardous solid waste landfills and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become increasingly difficult and expensive to obtain 
permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance with zoning  environmental and other regulatory measures 
these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures 
our failure to obtain the required permits to operate non hazardous solid waste landfills could have a material negative effect on our future results of operations 
the solid waste industry is a capital intensive industry that may consume cash from our operations and borrowings 
our ability to remain competitive  grow and expand operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital 
we spent approximately million in combination for our capital expenditures and landfill capping  closure  and post closure and environmental remediation expenditures during  and we expect to spend approximately million for these purposes in if we undertake more acquisitions or further expand our operations  the amount we expend on capital  capping  closure  and post closure and environmental remediation expenditures will increase 
acquisitions may increase our capital requirements because acquisitions may require sizable amounts of capital and competition with other solid waste companies that have a similar acquisition strategy may increase costs 
increases in expenditures will result in low levels of working capital or require us to finance working capital deficits 
we intend to continue to fund our cash needs through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility  if necessary 
however  we may require additional equity and or debt financing for debt repayment obligations  to fund our operations and or to grow our business 
our cash needs will increase if the expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring increase above our current estimates for these costs 
expenditures for these costs may increase as a result of any federal  state or local government regulatory action  including changes in closing or monitoring activities  types and quantities of materials used or the period of required post closure monitoring 
these factors  together with those discussed above  could substantially increase our operating costs and therefore impair our ability to invest in our existing facilities or new facilities 
we may not be able to obtain necessary financial assurances 
we are required to provide financial assurances to governmental agencies under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations and collection contracts 
in addition  we are required to provide financial assurances for our self insurance program 
we satisfy the financial assurances requirements by providing performance bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits 
as of december   we have total financial assurance requirements of billion  and we do not expect any material change in the amount of those requirements 
should we experience additional bond rating agency downgrades  the mix of financial assurance instruments may change  requiring us to provide additional letters of credit 
changes in interest rates may affect our results of operations 
at december   approximately of our debt was fixed  directly and through interest rate swap agreements 
the 
table of contents amount of this swap contract portfolio  which matures in the first quarter of  was million 
for certain interest rate swap agreements  we record non cash mark to market gains and losses based on changes in future yield curves to the statement of operations 
changes in the yield curves could result in additional non cash losses being recorded in the statement of operations 
us economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance and results of operations 
our business is affected by general economic conditions 
weakness in the us economy has a negative effect on our operating results  including decreases in revenues and operating cash flows 
additionally  in a down cycle economic environment  we may experience the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and customer turnover 
if economic conditions deteriorate  we will experience pressure on the pricing that we are able to achieve for our services 
in addition  worsening economic conditions may lead to further negative effects of customer turnover 
there can be no assurance that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 
additionally  there can be no assurance that an improvement in economic conditions will result in an immediate  if at all  positive improvement in our operating results 
we may be affected by adverse weather conditions 
our collection and landfill operations could be adversely affected by long periods of inclement weather which interfere with collection and landfill operations  delay the development of landfill capacity and or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers 
in addition  certain of our operations may be temporarily suspended as a result of particularly harsh weather conditions 
severe weather can negatively affect the costs of collection and disposal 
long periods of inclement weather could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
loss of key executives and failure to attract qualified management could limit our growth and negatively impact our operations 
we depend upon our senior management team 
we have announced the search for a permanent chairman and chief executive officer of the company 
we do not know how long that search will take or what the impact of the search and the transition to new leadership will be 
we also continue to depend on operations management personnel with waste industry experience 
we do not know the availability of such experienced management personnel or how much it may cost to attract and retain such personnel 
the loss of the services of any member of senior management or the inability to hire experienced operations management personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
we are subject to costly environmental regulations and environmental litigation 
our equipment  facilities  and operations are subject to extensive and changing federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational health and safety 
these include  among other things  laws and regulations governing the use  treatment  storage  and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials  air quality  water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances 
our compliance with these regulatory requirements is costly 
government laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the cost of complying with these laws and regulations 
in addition  environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations  we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations 
as a result  we may be required to pay fines  implement corrective measures or may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked 
we are  and also may be in the future  defendants in lawsuits brought by governmental 
table of contents agencies and surrounding landowners who assert claims alleging environmental damage  personal injury  property damage and or violations of permits and licenses by us 
a significant judgment against us  the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material negative effect on our financial condition 
certain of our waste disposal operations traverse state and county boundaries 
in the future  our collection  transfer and landfill operations may also be affected by proposed federal legislation that authorizes the states to enact legislation governing interstate shipments of waste 
such proposed federal legislation may allow individual states to prohibit the disposal of out of state waste or to limit the amount of out of state waste that could be imported for disposal and may require states  under some circumstances  to reduce the amount of waste exported to other states 
if this or similar legislation is enacted in states in which we operate landfills that receive a significant portion of waste originating from out of state  our operations could be negatively affected 
we believe that several states have proposed or have considered adopting legislation that would regulate the interstate transportation and disposal of waste in the states landfills 
our collection  transfer and landfill operations may also be affected by flow control legislation which may be proposed in the united states congress 
this proposed federal legislation may allow states and local governments to direct waste generated within their jurisdictions to a specific facility for disposal or processing 
if this or similar legislation is enacted  state or local governments with jurisdiction over our landfills could act to limit or prohibit disposal or processing of waste in our landfills 
we may have potential environmental liabilities that are greater than our insurance coverage 
we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations 
any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
due to the limited nature of our insurance coverage for environmental liability  if we were to incur substantial financial liability for environmental damage  our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may have additional hazardous substances liability 
we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under the cercla and analogous state laws 
cercla provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict  joint and several liability on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance  former site owners and operators at the time of disposal of the hazardous substance s and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility ie generator of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site 
hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under cercla and their presence  even in minute amounts  can result in substantial liability 
as used in this report  non hazardous waste means substances that are not defined as hazardous waste under federal regulations 
the statute provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes costs on the responsible parties 
the expense of conducting such a cleanup can be significant 
we have significant liabilities under these laws  primarily due to acquired businesses and properties and their former operations 
notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances  we may have additional liability because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills  or in waste collected  transported or disposed of in the past by acquired companies 
in addition  actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes 
there may be undisclosed liabilities associated with our acquisitions 
in connection with any acquisition made by us  there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or are unable to discover including liabilities arising from non compliance with environmental laws by prior owners and for which we  as successor owner  may be responsible 
similarly  we incur capitalized costs associated with acquisitions  which may never be consummated  resulting in a potential charge to earnings 

table of contents we are subject to examination by various federal and state taxing authorities 
we are currently under examination by various federal and state taxing authorities for certain tax years 
any material disagreement with taxing authorities could result in large cash expenditures and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
a federal income tax audit for the calendar years through is ongoing 
a federal income tax audit for bfi s tax years ended september  through july   is completed with the exception of the following matter 
during  the irs proposed the disallowance of a capital loss included in bfi s july  tax return 
if such disallowance is upheld  we estimate it could have a potential total cash impact of up to million plus accrued interest through december  of approximately million million net of tax benefit 
we also received a notification from the irs proposing a penalty of of the additional income tax resulting from the disallowance 
we believe that the resolution of this matter will likely require litigation 
this litigation could take a couple of years before a court reaches a decision 
an unfavorable resolution of this matter could require future potential cash expenditures that could have a material negative effect on our financial condition 
our goodwill may become impaired 
we have a substantial amount of goodwill resulting from our acquisitions  including bfi and laidlaw 
at least annually  we evaluate this goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of each geographic operating segment 
this estimated fair value could change if there were future changes in our capital structure  cost of debt  interest rates  capital expenditure levels  ability to perform at levels that were forecasted or a permanent change to the market capitalization of our company 
these changes could result in an impairment that would require a material non cash charge to our results of operations 
as a result of our geographic realignment in the fourth quarter of  our nine regions became our reporting units 
since impairment is measured at the reporting unit level  this increase from four to nine reporting units increases the possibility we may have to record an impairment in the future 
fluctuations in commodity prices could affect our operating results 
as part of our recycling services  we process recyclable materials such as paper  cardboard  plastics  aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties  generally at current market prices 
all of these materials are subject to significant price fluctuations  which are driven by general market conditions 
these price fluctuations may affect our future operating income and cash flows 
also  fluctuations in fuel prices and other commodities used in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we may be subject to work stoppages  which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 
as of december   approximately of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions 
if our unionized workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown in the future  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  if a greater percentage of our work force becomes unionized  our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
we may not realize any or all of the expected benefits from our significant investment in the development and implementation of our excellence driven standards and best practices program 
we have invested in the identification  development and implementation of best practice programs intended to improve productivity  enhance the quality of our revenue collections and reduce costs 
we cannot guarantee that all or any expected improvements will materialize or have a positive effect on operating results 
the outcome of litigation and governmental proceedings could impact our liquidity 
we are currently involved in litigation and governmental proceedings related to the business 
the timing and outcome of the final resolution to these matters is uncertain 
the possible resolution to these 
table of contents matters could include judgements against us or settlements that could require substantial payments that adversely affect our liquidity 
we are required to make accounting estimates and judgments in the ordinary course of business 
the accounting estimates and judgments we must make in the ordinary course of business affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of our operating results during the periods presented as described under critical accounting judgments and estimates above 
additionally  we are required to interpret the accounting rules in existence as of the date of the financial statements when the accounting rules are not specific to a particular event or transaction 
if the underlying estimates are ultimately proved to be incorrect  or if auditors or regulators subsequently interpret our application of accounting rules differently  subsequent adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period or periods in which the change is identified 
additionally  subsequent adjustments could require us to restate our financial statements 
restating our financial statements could result in a material change in our stock price 
the adoption of new accounting standards or interpretations could adversely impact our results of operations 
our implementation of new accounting rules and interpretations or compliance with changes in the existing accounting rules could adversely affect our balance sheet or results of operations  or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions our objective is to be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors have and may continue to require us to absorb cost increases resulting from inflation 
as a result  we have been unable to implement price increases sufficient to offset cost increases resulting from inflation 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we are unable to determine the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate long term debt 
to reduce the risk from interest rate fluctuations  we enter into hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we have effectively converted a portion of our long term debt  which required payment at variable rates of interest  to fixed rate obligations through interest rate swap transactions 
these transactions required us to pay fixed rates of interest on notional amounts of principal to counter parties 
the counter parties  in turn  paid to us variable rates of interest on the same notional amounts of principal 
in addition  during we entered into interest rate swap contracts that convert fixed rate debt to variable interest rates to effectively manage the percentage of our debt portfolio that has fixed rate terms 
under these transactions  which were terminated in the fourth quarter of  we were required to pay variable rates on notional amounts of principal to counter parties 
the counter parties  in turn  paid to us the fixed rates of interest on the same notional amount of principal 
the following interest rate table summarizes the interest rate swap that was in effect and its fair value as of december  notional interest underlying interest fair market principal maturity paid obligations received value liability in millions in millions march term loan facility libor 
table of contents increases or decreases in short term market rates did not materially impact cash flow in as a significant portion of variable rate debt had been swapped for fixed rates 
at december   with of our debt fixed either directly or through interest rate swap agreements  we have billion of floating rate debt 
if interest rates increased by basis points  annualized interest expense would increase by approximately million million after tax 
this analysis does not reflect the effect that interest rates would have on other items  such as new borrowings nor the favorable impact declining rates would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information regarding how we manage interest rate risk 
fuel prices 
fuel costs represent a significant operating expense 
at our current consumption levels  a one cent change in the price of diesel fuel would affect our annual operating results by approximately million 
accordingly  a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our results of operations 
historically  we have mitigated this impact with fixed price purchase contracts 
since a significant portion of these contracts expire in early  we are initiating a strategic change to implement fuel charges to appropriate customers that will vary with the cost of fuel in addition to entering into new or renewed contracts when economically practical
