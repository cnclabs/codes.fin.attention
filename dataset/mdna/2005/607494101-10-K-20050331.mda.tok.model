item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis provides material historical and prospective disclosures intended to enable investors and other users to assess our financial condition and results of operations 
statements that are not historical are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties discussed below under the caption forward looking statements 
the following discussion of the results of the operations and financial condition of mocon should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto 
overview mocon  inc designs  manufactures  markets  and services products and provides consulting services primarily in the measurement and analytical instrument and services markets 
our products include instruments that detect  measure and monitor gases and chemical compounds as well as products that prepare samples of various substances for laboratory analysis 
although some of the markets for our products are maturing  we continually seek growth opportunities through technological and product improvement  by acquiring and developing new products  and by acquiring new companies 
we have three primary operating locations in the united states minnesota  colorado and texas and one in germany 
we use a direct sales force to market our products and services in the united states  canada and germany and use a network of independent sales representatives to market and service our products and services in other foreign countries 
overall summary of financial results sales for were  an increase of compared to  for net income in was  a increase compared to  in  and net income per diluted share was in  a increase compared to for our financial position as of december  reflects an increase in working capital of  to  compared to  at december  significant transactions and financial trends throughout these financial sections  you will read about significant transactions or events that materially contribute to  or reduce  our earnings  and materially affect our financial trends 
significant transactions and events that affected our financial results and position included the acquisition of paul lippke handels gmbh prozess und laborsysteme lippke in germany  an impairment charge related to intangible technology rights associated with our lab connections  inc lci subsidiary  and the movement of all of lci s  and a significant portion of our baseline mocon  inc subsidiary s  production to our main manufacturing facility in minneapolis  minnesota  along with the costs associated with these moves 
these significant transactions result from unique facts and circumstances and  given their nature  some of these items will likely not recur with similar materiality or impact on our continuing operations 
while these items are important in understanding and evaluating our financial results and trends  other transactions or events such as those discussed later in this management s discussion and analysis may also have a material impact on financial trends 
prior to  we expanded our business primarily through internally developing new products and technologies  acquiring product lines and technology  and licensing our products and technology 
since  we have supplemented our internal growth through a total of five acquisitions that have provided us with additional technologies  products and product development expertise 
we completed our most recent acquisition effective january   by acquiring paul lippke handels gmbh prozess und laborsysteme lippke  which is located in germany 
lippke had been the primary distributor of our products in europe for approximately years  and also served in the capacity of distributor or agent for several companies in addition to mocon 
our acquisition of lippke provides us with a direct presence in europe 
we acquired all of the shares of lippke for a base purchase price of  in addition  we are obligated to make three future earnout payments to lippke s former parent company based on the net profits of lippke in each of the years   and  with a minimum payment amount of  euros per year 
it is anticipated that the earnout payments will be made to the former parent company of lippke at or near the end of the first quarter of each of the years   and the earnout payment due for based on lippke s net profits is  our international sales have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues  and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future  especially as a result of our acquisition of lippke  which thus far has had  and is expected to continue to have  a positive impact on our sales  particularly on our foreign permeation products sales 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
this management s discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the securities and exchange commission has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the following critical accounting policies 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are estimated to be uncollectible as well as estimated sales returns 
this reserve is based on a number of factors  including an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write offs and sales returns 
the analysis includes the age of the receivable  the financial condition of a customer or industry  and general economic conditions 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsened for our customers 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns is appropriate  we would record a credit or charge to selling  general  and administrative expense in the period that we made such a determination 
as of december   we had  reserved against our accounts receivable for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventories we perform an analysis to identify inventory shrinkage  and excess and obsolete inventory 
we record a charge to cost of sales for amounts identified 
our analysis includes inventory levels  the nature of the finished product and its inherent risk of obsolescence  the gross margin of the product  and the on hand quantities relative to the sales history of that finished product 
we believe that the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions or otherwise 
our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories at december  was  recoverability of long lived assets we assess the recoverability of goodwill and other long lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that expected future undiscounted cash flows might not be sufficient to support the carrying amount of an asset 
we deem an asset to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows is less than an asset s carrying amount 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a  charge for the impairment of intangible technology rights associated with our lab connections  inc subsidiary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this charge 
changes in our business strategies  changes in the economic environment in which we operate  competitive conditions  and other factors could result in future impairment charges 
accrued product warranties our products are generally covered by a warranty  with warranty periods ranging from ninety days to one year from the date of sale 
estimated warranty costs are accrued in the same period in which the related revenue is recognized  based on anticipated parts and labor costs  utilizing historical experience 
special warranty reserves are also accrued for major rework campaigns 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty reserves based on changes in these factors and record any necessary adjustments if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
although we believe the likelihood to be relatively low  warranty claims experience could be materially different from actual results due to manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  a change in our warranty policy in response to industry trends  as yet unrecognized defects in products sold  or other factors 
as of december   we had  accrued related to future estimated warranty claims 
income taxes in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposures together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
management reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for valuation allowances 
these deferred tax assets are evaluated by considering historical levels of income  estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets 
we carried no valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at either december  or inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years  however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth the relationship between various components of our results of operations  stated as a percent of sales  for fiscal years  and our historical financial data were derived from our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
percent of sales sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating income other income income before income taxes income taxes net income the following table sets forth the relationship between various components of domestic and foreign sales  stated as a percent of total sales  for fiscal years  and percent of sales domestic sales foreign sales western europe japan canada other total foreign sales total sales net sales sales were  in  compared to  in and  in the  or  increase in sales in versus was primarily the result of the lippke acquisition  which provided  in net incremental sales 
on a product basis  the increase was primarily due to increased foreign sales volume of our permeation products  foreign sales volume of our leak detection products  domestic sales volume of our gas analyzer products  foreign sales volume of our headspace analyzer products  and foreign sales volume of our weighing and pharmaceutical products  offset somewhat by decreases in the domestic sales volume of our permeation products and domestic sales volume of our weighing and pharmaceutical products 
these sales volume increases were generally the result of increased demand 
the impact of price increases was not significant in the slight decrease in sales from to was primarily the result of decreases in the domestic sales volume of our sample preparation products  domestic and foreign sales volume of our gas analyzer products  domestic sales volume of our gas chromatography analyzer products and foreign sales volume of our leak detection products  offset by increases in the foreign sales volume of our permeation products and domestic and foreign sales volume of our weighing products 
the impact of price increases in was not significant 
domestic sales were  or of total sales in  a dollar increase of compared to  or of total sales in domestic sales were  or of total sales in foreign sales were  or of total sales in  a dollar increase of compared to  or of total sales in foreign sales were  or of total sales in permeation products sales of our permeation products were   and  approximately  and of our consolidated sales in  and  respectively 
the  or  increase in permeation sales in compared to  was primarily due to increases in foreign sales  particularly in western europe and japan  offset somewhat by decreases in sales to domestic customers 
the increase in sales to western europe includes  in net incremental sales from lippke 
total sales of our permeation products increased  or  in versus  due primarily to increases in foreign sales  particularly in western europe  japan  and canada 
we believe that the domestic market for our permeation products  which is where we initially introduced our permeation products when the company was founded  is maturing  but that the market for our permeation products outside of the united states  where the demand for sophisticated packaging and other products is continuing to develop  and the use of our equipment is still in many areas somewhat limited  is likely to continue to grow 
weighing and pharmaceutical products sales of our weighing and pharmaceutical products were   and  approximately  and of our consolidated sales in  and  respectively 
weighing and pharmaceutical product sales increased  or  in versus  primarily due to increases in foreign sales  offset somewhat by decreases in sales to domestic customers 
the increase in foreign sales includes  in net incremental sales from lippke to customers in western europe  consisting primarily of commissions earned relating to tablet inspection systems 
weighing product sales increased  or  in over due to an increase in the sales of our ab weighing systems  and to a lesser extent increases in the sales of our vericap systems 
the increase in sales of the ab systems was due in part to ab systems being sold in markets outside of the traditional pharmaceutical market 
because of significant competition in the market for weighing products  we do not expect the sales of our weighing and pharmaceutical products to increase in sample preparation products sales of our sample preparation products through our lab connections  inc lci subsidiary were   and  approximately  and of our consolidated sales in  and  respectively 
sales of sample preparation products increased  or  in as compared to  due primarily to an increase in foreign sales  particularly foreign sales of a unit designed for high temperature polymer analysis 
sales of sample preparation products decreased  or  in from  primarily due to significant sales of a new unit to one particular customer for use in the drug discovery and life sciences markets in not being repeated in as a result of the lower sales of our sample preparation products in and early  we consolidated our lci operations into our minneapolis  minnesota  and austin  texas  locations  and closed our boston lci location effective february  the total costs incurred in the first quarter of associated with this relocation were  as anticipated  the closing of our boston location resulted in a reduction in certain operating costs  however  despite these measures  lci experienced an operating loss for as a whole 
therefore  as more fully outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  a charge for  related to the impairment of lci s intangible technology rights was incurred in fourth quarter gas analyzer products sales of our gas analysis and monitoring instrumentation products through our baseline mocon  inc subsidiary were   and  approximately  and of our consolidated sales in  and  respectively 
the  or  increase in sales in as compared to was primarily due to increased sales in of the pid tech tm photoionization detector on an oem basis to other manufacturers 
we believe the  or  decrease in sales in as compared to was due mostly to slowness in some of the industries that baseline serves 
in order to reduce operating costs and increase operating efficiencies  we moved the majority of baseline s production to our facility in minneapolis  minnesota in gas chromatography analyzer products sales of our gas chromatography analyzer products through our microanalytics instrumentation corp 
microanalytics subsidiary were   and  approximately  and of our consolidated sales  in   and  respectively 
the  or  increase in sales in as compared to was due primarily to increased revenues associated with sales of microanalytics testing services 
the  or  decrease in sales in as compared to was primarily due to decreased revenues associated with sales of microanalytics testing services 
leak detection products sales of our leak detection products were   and  approximately  and of our consolidated sales  in   and  respectively 
leak detection sales increased  or  in compared to  primarily due to increases in foreign sales  which includes  in net incremental sales from lippke 
the  or  decrease in versus was primarily due to foreign sales of our non destructive leak detector unit in not being repeated in headspace analyzer products sales of our headspace analyzer products were   and  approximately  and of our consolidated sales  in   and  respectively 
the  or  increase in headspace analyzer sales in compared to was primarily due to  net incremental sales from lippke  and to a lesser degree to continued increases in sales of hand held headspace analyzer products  which were originally introduced in sales of these handheld products were also a factor in the  or  increase in sales in over consulting and analytical services consulting and analytical services cas sales were   and  approximately  and of our consolidated sales in   and  respectively 
the majority of cas sales are to domestic customers 
gross profit our gross profits were   and  approximately  and of our consolidated sales  in  and  respectively 
the gross profit margin as a percentage of total sales was somewhat lower than due primarily to costs associated with the transfer of the majority of our baseline subsidiary s production to our facility in minneapolis  minnesota in  to expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the lippke purchase  to the scrapping of inventory that had become obsolete  and to production expenses associated with our vaculok product line  which did not have significant revenues in  offset somewhat by the product mix in including more permeation product sales  which on average carry a higher gross margin 
the gross profit margin was slightly higher than the prior year due to the product mix in including more permeation and weighing product sales  which on average carry a higher gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in were  or of sales  compared to  or of sales in  and  or of sales in the increase in the dollar amount of sg a expenses from to was primarily due to the addition of lippke s sg a expenses in  to the expense associated with the lci intangible technology rights one time impairment charge in  and to a lesser extent to recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations more fully described below under forward looking statements  which increased certain general and administrative costs in the increase in sg a expenses from to was primarily due to an increase in tradeshow expense in an effort to increase future sales  offset somewhat by a decrease in commission expense associated with domestic sales 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses were  or approximately of sales in  compared to  or approximately of sales in  and  or approximately of sales in continued r d expenditures are necessary as we develop new products to expand in our niche markets 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to allocate on an annual basis approximately to of sales to research and development 
other income other income consists primarily of interest and investment income  and currency exchange rate gains and losses 
other income decreased to  in from  in and  in the slight decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower average investment yields 
the decrease in from was primarily due to lower average investment yields  offset by higher average investment balances  during versus income tax expense our provision for income taxes was of income before income taxes in and and in and  respectively 
based on current operating conditions and income tax laws  we expect our core tax rate for to be in the range of to 
in addition  we believe that we are close to finalizing an internal revenue service examination  which is expected to have a favorable effect on our overall effective income tax rate 
the american jobs creation act of the act was passed in october and included numerous law changes that will also affect our tax computations 
the provisions of the act include a new deduction for us manufacturers  the repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion and a provision regarding the repatriation of foreign earnings 
we are studying the new law to determine what impact the act will have on our effective tax rate 
net income net income was  in compared to  in  and  in diluted net income per share was per share in compared to per share in  and per share in liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations and capital equipment requirements through cash flows generated from operations 
total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased  during to  as of december   compared to  at december  our working capital as of december  increased  to  compared to  at december  we believe that a combination of our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  plus an expected continuation of cash flow from operations  will continue to be adequate to fund operations  capital expenditures  dividend payments  stock repurchases  and required earnout payments to the former parent company of lippke  for at least the next twelve months 
however  one of our strategic objectives is  as market and business conditions warrant  to consider acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
we may need to fund such activities  should they arise  with debt and or equity financing 
cash flow cash flows from operating activities our primary source of funds is cash provided by operations 
cash flow from operations totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
in  cash provided by operating activities increased by  or  compared to this change was due primarily to higher net income  addback of depreciation and amortization and the changes in inventories and accounts payable  offset somewhat by the change in deferred income taxes and the increase in trade accounts receivable 
the increase in trade accounts receivable in versus is primarily due an increase in sales in the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of mostly due to the addition of lippke  offset somewhat by improved accounts receivable collection 
inventory remained generally consistent in compared to  despite increased sales in  due in part to the consolidation of baseline and lci inventory in our minneapolis  minnesota location 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued compensation and vacation is primarily due to the addition of lippke 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities totaled  in as compared to  in cash flow provided by investing activities totaled  in net proceeds purchases from maturities of marketable securities were   and  in  and  respectively 
purchases of property  plant and equipment totaled  in  primarily for additions of manufacturing and laboratory equipment  as compared to  and  in and  respectively 
we expect purchases of property  plant and equipment in to be similar to the levels in effective january   we acquired all of the shares of lippke for a base purchase price of  in addition  we are obligated to make three future earnout payments to lippke s former parent company based on the net profits of lippke in each of the years   and  with a minimum payment amount of  euros per year 
it is anticipated that the earnout payments will be made to the former parent company of lippke at or near the end of the first quarter of each of the years   and the earnout payment due for based on lippke s net profits is cash flows from financing activities cash used in financing activities consists primarily of the purchase and retirement of common stock  payment of dividends to our shareholders  and a dividend payment to lippke s former parent company 
during  we made final dividend payments of  to lippke s former parent company and dividend payments of  to our shareholders  for total dividend payments of  during  we made dividend payments of  to our shareholders 
our board of directors has authorized  depending upon market conditions and other factors  the repurchase of up to a total of  of our common stock at prices not exceeding prevailing market prices at the time of purchase 
we made repurchases of our common stock totaling  and  in and  respectively  related to this authorization and  in related to a previous authorization 
as of december    was remaining in the current authorization 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  we do not believe that any major property  plant and equipment expenditures are required to accommodate our current level of operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases total contractual cash obligations in january  we acquired all of the shares of lippke for a base purchase price of  in addition  we are obligated to make three future earnout payments to lippke s former parent company based on the net profits of lippke in each of the years   and  with a minimum payment amount of  euros per year which is included in the financial statements 
it is anticipated that the earnout payments will be made to the former parent company of lippke at or near the end of the first quarter of each of the years   and based upon the net profit calculation of lippke as of december   we have recorded an obligation for the first payment due to lippke s former parent company in the amount of  as of december   and  for the minimum payable for and off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases entered in the ordinary course of business  we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp provides accounting guidance for companies that will be eligible for a tax deduction resulting from qualified production activities income as defined in the american jobs creation act of the act 
fsp requires this deduction be treated as a special deduction in accordance with sfas  which does not require a revaluation of our us deferred tax assets 
we will apply the guidance in fsp upon recognition of this tax deduction beginning january  the application of fsp is not currently expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp provides accounting guidance for the one time tax deduction of of certain non us earnings that are repatriated in excess of a base amount as defined in the act 
sfas requires a company to reflect in the period of enactment the effect of a new tax law 
due to the lack of clarification of certain provisions within the act  fsp allows companies time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the act 
we have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision 
however  we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after congress and the treasury department provide additional clarification on key elements of the provision 
we expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of all relevant guidance 
the range of possible amounts  including the base  which we are considering for repatriation under this provision  is between zero and  the related incremental provision for income taxes would be zero due to foreign tax credits available to offset any resulting taxes 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges  and that fixed production overheads should be allocated to inventory based on normal capacity of production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  accordingly  we will adopt sfas in the fiscal year beginning january  we are currently in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payments fas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation statement 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees opinion which allowed companies to use the intrinsic value method of valuing share based payment transactions and amends fas statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
fas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
fas r is effective at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we expect to adopt statement r on july  the adoption of fas r s fair value method is expected to have an impact on our results of operations  though it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
fas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of fas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of fas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we expect to adopt statement r effective july  using the modified prospective method 
the impact of adoption of fas r cannot be accurately predicted at this time since it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted fas r in prior periods  the impact of the standard would have approximated the impact of fas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  there were no amounts of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions in  and as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments using the apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees intrinsic value method of valuing share based payment transactions and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options

statements that are not historical are forward looking and reflect expectations and assumptions 
we try to identify forward looking statements in this report and elsewhere by using words such as may  will  should  expects  anticipates  contemplates  estimates  believes  plans  projected  predicts  potential or continue or the negative of these or similar terms 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
these uncertainties include factors that affect all businesses as well as matters specific to mocon

we wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statement that speaks only as of the date made and to recognize that forward looking statements are predictions of future results  which may not occur as anticipated 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements and from historical results  due to the risks and uncertainties described above  as well as others that we may consider immaterial or do not anticipate at this time 
the foregoing risks and uncertainties are not exclusive and further information concerning us and our business  including factors that potentially could materially affect our financial results or condition  may emerge from time to time 
we assume no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward looking statements 
we advise you  however  to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k we file with or furnish to the securities and exchange commission 
if we experience any increase in the cost of raw materials or supplies  we may experience a decrease in profit margins 
in the past  the overall cost of the materials that we purchase has not risen much more than the rate of inflation  although the price of some of the components that we purchase has increased in the past several years due in part to our purchasing fewer of such components 
certain other material and labor costs have increased  but we believe that such increases are approximately consistent with overall inflation rates 
we believe that the price of our products and the prices of our competitors products is a significant factor affecting our customers buying decisions and consequently  we may not be able to pass along any cost increases in raw materials and supplies in the form of price increases or sustain profit margins that we have achieved in prior years 
the markets in which we operate have experienced minimal growth in recent years  and our ability to increase our revenues will depend in part on our ability to develop new products  develop new applications for our existing products and to acquire complementary businesses and product lines 
the analytical and measurement instrument markets in which we operate have not shown significant growth in recent years 
although we have identified a number of strategies that we believe will allow us to grow our business and increase our sales  including developing new products and technologies  developing new applications for our technologies  acquiring complementary businesses and product lines  and strengthening our sales force  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement these strategies  or that these strategies will result in the growth of our business or an increase in our sales 
if we acquire businesses in the future  we could experience a decrease in our profit margins  a decrease in our net income  and other adverse consequences 
one of our growth strategies is to supplement our internal growth with the acquisition of businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing products 
some of the businesses that we previously acquired have produced net operating losses or low levels of profitability 
businesses that we may acquire in the future may be marginally profitable or unprofitable 
we will likely have to successfully change the operations of any companies that we acquire in the future and improve the market penetration of such companies in order to achieve the level of profitability that we desire 
this could result in the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
in addition  acquisitions that we believe will be beneficial to our business and financial results are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including the competition among prospective buyers 
we may not be able to complete acquisitions in the future and any acquisitions that we do complete may have an adverse effect on our financial performance and liquidity 
it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds either through public or private debt or equity financing in order to finance any future acquisitions 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us and may dilute the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders 
we face risks of technological changes that may render our products obsolete 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapid and significant technological change and evolving industry standards 
as a result of such changes and evolving standards  our products may become noncompetitive or obsolete and we may have to develop new products in order to maintain or increase our revenues 
new product introductions that are responsive to these factors require significant planning  design  development and testing at the technological  product  and manufacturing process levels  and we may not be able to timely develop new products 
in addition  industry acceptance of new technologies that we may develop may be slow to develop due to  among other things  existing regulations or standards written specifically for older technologies and general unfamiliarity of users with new technologies 
as a result  any new products that we may develop may not generate any meaningful revenues or profits for us for a number of years  if at all 
any reduction in the level of capital expenditures by our customers could negatively impact our sales 
our customers include pharmaceutical  food  medical  and chemical companies  laboratories  government agencies  and public and private research institutions 
the capital spending of these entities can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
any decrease in capital spending by any of these customer groups could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
a significant portion of our sales are generated from foreign countries and selling in foreign countries entails a number of risks which could result in a decrease to our sales or an increase in our operating expenses 
sales outside the united states accounted for approximately of our sales in and approximately and of our sales in and  respectively 
we expect that foreign sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the future 
sales to customers in foreign countries are subject to a number of risks  including the following agreements may be difficult to enforce  receivables may be difficult to collect  certain regions are experiencing political unrest and conflict  foreign customers may have longer payment cycles  the countries into which we sell may impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  currency fluctuations could reduce reported profitability in future periods  fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand  export licenses  if required  may be difficult to obtain  and protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce 
if any of these risks were to materialize  our sales into foreign countries could decline  or our operating costs could increase  which would adversely affect our financial results 
some of our competitors have greater resources than we do  which may provide our competitors with an advantage in the development and marketing of new products 
we currently encounter  and expect to continue to encounter  competition in the sale of our products 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products include product quality and performance  price  reliability and customer service 
our competitors include large multinational corporations 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
in addition  competition could increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines 
our current products  products under development and our ability to discover new technologies may be insufficient to enable us to compete effectively with our competitors 
our reliance upon patents  domestic trademark laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from others who may sell similar products 
we hold patents relating to various aspects of our products and believe that proprietary technical know how is critical to many of our products 
proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets 
we cannot be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in the absence of patent protection  we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
our competitors may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents  or they may use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe our patents 
we may incur substantial costs if our competitors initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights and if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
there may also be pending or issued patents held by parties not affiliated with us that relate to our products or technologies and we may need to acquire licenses to any such patents to continue selling some or all of our products 
if we had to obtain any such license in order to be able to continue to sell some or all of our products  we may not be able to do so on terms that were favorable to us  if at all 
in addition  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees  and consultants 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
even if these confidentiality agreements are not breached  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future and any broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past  ranging from a high sales price of and a low sales price of during  and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future 
these factors include announcements of new products by us or our competitors  quarterly fluctuations in our financial results  customer contract awards  developments in regulation  and general economic and political conditions in the various markets where our products are sold 
in addition  the stock prices of instrumentation companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
this market volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
recently enacted and future changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  are creating challenges for publicly held companies including us 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment will require the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources in  and is expected to require ongoing financial and managerial resources in and beyond 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk substantially all of our marketable securities are at fixed interest rates 
however  virtually all of the marketable securities mature in two years or less  therefore  we believe that the market risk arising from the holding of these financial instruments is minimal 
foreign currency exchange risk because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states  a stronger us dollar generally has a negative impact on our results from operations outside of the united states while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect 
we currently sell our products and services in united states dollars or the local currency of our foreign subsidiary euros 
accordingly  our foreign operations expose us to foreign currency exchange risk when the euro currency results of operations are translated to united states dollars 
while we historically have not experienced any material foreign currency translation losses  we may engage in hedging activity in the future to minimize this risk 
our net investment in foreign subsidiary translated into us dollars is not hedged 
any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity  and would not impact our net income
