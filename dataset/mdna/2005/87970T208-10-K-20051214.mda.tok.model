item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets products based on its proprietary interface technologies 
these products provide the capability to connect standard telecommunications equipment  including standard telephones  fax machines  data modems and alarm panels with wireless communication networks in the cellular and pcs frequency bands collectively cellular 
bridging the gap between wireline customer premises equipment and cellular networks  these technologies provide the company s products with the look and feel of the wireline network  providing critical communications and security needs in a variety of environments 
we refer to this concept as fixed cellular 
the growth of fixed cellular in any given market is dependent to a considerable extent upon the growth of cellular telephone service in that market as a cost effective alternative to or substitute for landline telephone systems 
consequently  in managing the business and making decisions about where to invest resources  the company s management collects data and follows trends in the following areas of the cellular industry the cost of cellular airtime rates to consumers the cost of cellular equipment technology and components the capabilities of deployed cellular systems the number of cellular operators in a given market operating characteristics of worldwide cellular operators the number of deployed cellular networks using the same technology consumer attitudes toward cellular technology competitive and substitute products in the market place global economic conditions and economic conditions in key markets for fixed wireless telephony regulation in key markets for fixed wireless based upon trends noted from data collected in the above areas  such as improved economic conditions in latin america and substantial growth in the adoption of fixed wireless in asia  the company believes that the market for fixed cellular will experience substantial growth over the next five years see outlook below 
the company generates most of its revenue by making and selling products 
it recognizes revenue when its products ship from various manufacturing locations to customers 
although the company has a broad base of customers worldwide  much of its revenue is generated from large contracts  the timing of which is often unpredictable 
the company s operating expense levels are based in large part on expectations of future revenues 
if anticipated sales in any quarter do not occur as expected  expenditure and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and the company s operating results for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  could be adversely affected 
certain factors that could significantly impact expected results are described in cautionary statements that are set forth in exhibit to this document 
overview wireless local loop wll  the concept of connecting standard telecommunications equipment to cellular networks  is the foundation upon which the company s business is built 
it is this concept that defines our core value proposition 
in developing countries where wireline service is deficient or non existent  our products provide basic telephone service over existing cellular networks as well as over new networks being constructed to expand telephone service in those countries 
the developed world  including the united states and western europe  has the luxury of choice when it comes to telecommunications services 
digitization  capacity improvements  high speed data  and boundary less roaming have contributed to the success that cellular operators have enjoyed through the late s 
pervasive network coverage and lower airtime rates are driving consumers to increased cellular usage in all parts of their lives  both professional and personal 
as a result  some consumers are beginning to abandon their wired phone service altogether in favor of cellular service 
the company s business segments through fiscal year have been are divided between its two principal product lines phonecell  a line of fixed cellular terminals fct s and fixed cellular phones fcp s and telguard  a line of fct s and services for the wireless security market 
beginning in fiscal year october  to september   the company is operating under a new strategy announced in august under the new strategy  the company will focus its resources and investments on two distinct segments phonecell fixed cellular phones fcp and fixed cellular terminals fct 
the fcp segment consists of the high volume low cost fixed cellular phones and the fct segment consists of the feature rich high end fixed cellular terminals  including the telguard family of products 
the fcp market is prevalent in countries outside of north america with low fixed line penetration 
cellular carriers offering services in this market are price driven as they target residential and small business markets where equipment subsidies are often used to reach the requisite end user price points 
this market is experiencing very high growth with unprecedented volumes 
the fct market is mostly in north america and consists of a number of vertical applications ranging from wireless residential and commercial alarm systems addressed by telguard to machine to machine and portable dial tone applications addressed by phonecell fct s 
comparatively lower volumes and higher margins are typical in this market segment 
each business segment plans to streamline its product line and distribution methods to maximize efficiency 
we will continue to pursue the fcp market through direct sales and localized support to a tightly focused set of wireless network operators with high volume potential 
the fct market will be addressed through indirect channels consisting of distributors  representatives and agents with a strong inside sales and customer support team 
to achieve the high volume needs of the fcp market  telular has entered into an agreement with an electronics manufacturer in china 
this will allow the company to be a lower cost producer of fcp s 
in support of the new strategy  the company also announced organizational changes so that its sales  marketing  development and support resources will focus more independently on the two segments 
as a result of the change is strategy  the company will report business segment results by market ie fcp and fct rather than by brand ie  phonecell and telguard for fiscal year the company believes that its future success depends on its ability to continue to meet customers needs through product innovation  rapid time to market with new products  and superior in market customer support 
current product lines deploy the major worldwide cellular air interface standards gsm  cdma and tdma 
the expectation for fiscal year is the development and launch of a new low cost phone for gsm as well as a replacement terminal 
as continued growth is expected in the gsm market for fixed wireless devices  the company is positioning itself to capitalize on the demand for phones to support rural regions of developing markets and the special applications 
the fiscal year development for cdma products will also focus on low cost alternatives specifically in the mhz and mhz markets  leveraging the same core chip development as gsm 
fabrication of the company s products is accomplished through a combination of in house assembly and contract manufacturing 
contract manufacturers make and test all printed circuit boards for the company 
the final assembly of phonecell and telguard products is performed at our facility in vernon hills  illinois  and by contract manufacturers in mexico and china 
the fixed cellular industry consists of domestic and international telecommunications equipment companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than those of the telular  and includes companies such as ericsson  huawei technologies co  lg electronics and zte corporation 
axesstel  inc  csi wireless  inc  westech korea  inc 
and many smaller companies and startups present competition to telular in markets where enforcement of our patent protection is not available or practicable 
competing with these companies in price sensitive environments is challenging  but telular does so on the basis of our higher product quality and reliability  state of the art technology and enhanced features  rapid product innovation and customer support 
the competitive environment in the wireless security products industry is dominated by a few major equipment suppliers  who have leveraged proprietary systems to maintain their market share 
products in this market have historically been based on analog technology 
because demand for analog service in the united states is predicted to decline over time  the company is developing products based on digital technology 
the company has adopted an innovator role  and has competed successfully by introducing innovative new wireless technology into the marketplace 
with respect to its interface technology  the company currently has issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states  as well as foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications 
the company has successfully defended its patents in court

during fiscal year  cash and short term investments decreased million 
the company used million of cash from operating activities during fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year the cash used in operating activities is primarily the result of reduced profitability from lower sales volumes  offset by positive working capital changes 
these working capital changes accounted for million of cash generated and consist primarily of decreases in trade receivables and inventories 
this change in accounts receivable is principally the result of decreased sales volume and the change in inventories is principally related to the reserve established for obsolete and slow moving inventory in fiscal year cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal year compares to cash provided of million for fiscal year the fiscal year investing activities includes capital spending for product testing equipment of million compared to million during the prior year 
additionally  the fiscal year investing activities reflects million of cash restricted to support the letter of credit established for our contract manufacturer in china 
in fiscal year  the company generated cash by selling million net of marketable securities compared to the generation of cash by selling million net of marketable securities during the prior year 
this cash was used to support operations 
financing activities generated million of cash during fiscal year compared to million of cash generated during fiscal year the fiscal year amount consists primarily of the proceeds form the common stock issued during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year generation of cash consists of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
because the company is actively working to secure very large contracts  it is necessary for the company to maintain the capability to deliver large volumes of product with relatively short lead times 
consequently  the company has significant cash reserves  which it also uses to fund operating losses  working capital needs  and capital expenditures 
the company expects accounts receivables and inventories to turn into cash in a relatively short period of time 
management regularly reviews net working capital in addition to cash to determine if it has enough cash to operate the business 
the company generally requires its foreign customers to prepay  obtain letters of credit or to qualify for export credit insurance underwritten by third party credit insurance companies prior to making international shipments 
also  to mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations on the company s results of operations  the company conducts all of its international transactions in us dollars 
the following table sets forth our total contractual cash obligations as of september  payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements  primarily raw materials and finished goods inventory 
the company expects to satisfy these commitments from primarily cash from the revenues generated by delivery of backlog 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  net realizable value of inventories and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations reserve for obsolescence significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
the company currently considers inventory quantities greater than a one year supply based on current year activity as well as any additional specifically identified inventory to be excess 
the company also provides for the total value of inventories that are determined to be obsolete based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technologies 
at september  and  the inventory reserves were million and million  respectively 
changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuance or expansion of product lines  changes in technology or changes in market conditions  could result in significant changes in required reserves 
goodwill the company evaluates the fair value and recoverability of the goodwill see note to the consolidated financial statements of each of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable or at least annually 
in determining fair value and recoverability  the company makes projections regarding future cash flows 
these projections are based on assumptions and estimates of growth rates for the related business segment  anticipated future economic conditions  the assignment of discount rates relative to risk associated with companies in similar industries and estimates of terminal values 
an impairment loss is assessed and recognized in operating earnings when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
currently  the company has significant deferred tax assets principally related to net operating losses 
deferred tax assets are reviewed regularly for recoverability and when necessary  valuation allowances are established based on historical tax losses  projected future taxable income  and expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences 
valuation allowances have been provided for all deferred tax assets  due to the uncertainty about the realizability of such deferred tax assets 
future profitable operations and changes in the company s expectations could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances  which would significantly impact the company s results of operations

we do not anticipate this pronouncement having a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
outlook the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
the company believes that the market for cellular fct s will experience substantial growth over the next five years 
consistent with that expectation  the company s order backlog has increased to million as of october   from million as of october  the company has identified significant growth opportunities in africa  asia  latin america  europe and the united states 
each of these markets will develop at a different pace  and the sales cycle for these regions is likely to be several months or quarters 
the company is currently facing competition at prices that are reducing the price at which the company can sell its products to levels significantly lower than the company s historical gross margins for business in those countries 
the company is pursuing efforts to reduce its per unit costs and exploring partnership arrangements in an effort to respond to these competitive conditions 
over the last year  the company has been pursuing a large security business market opportunity in the united states  with a large wireless carrier and a prospective partner in the security business 
the company has recently learned that the business relationship between the prospective partner and the wireless carrier may not develop as necessary for the company to participate in the market opportunity 
the company is continuing to seek other opportunities to expand telguard in the united states 
further  the company has been pursuing a large wireline replacement opportunity in the united states with a large wireless carrier 
the company has recently learned that due to strategic direction changes at the large carrier the project will not continue 
the company is continuing to seek opportunities to expand phonecell business in the united states 
the amount and frequency of product shipments to the company s largest customers depends on many factors  including market conditions and agreements with other suppliers 
the outcome of pending and future negotiations for orders with such customers and the timing of shipments will have a significant impact on the company s future revenues and profitability 
forward looking information the company includes certain estimates  projections and other forward looking statements in its reports and in other publicly available material 
statements regarding expectations  including performance assumptions and estimates relating to capital requirements  as well as other statements that are not historical facts  are forwarding looking statements 
these statements reflect management s judgements based on currently available information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
with respect to these forward looking statements  management has made assumptions regarding  among other things  customer growth and retention  pricing  operating costs and the economic environment 
the words estimate  project  intend  expect  and believe  target and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are found throughout management s discussion and analysis 
the reader should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
the company is not obligated to publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements to reflect events after the date of this report or unforeseen events 
other risks and uncertainties are discussed in exhibit to this k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company frequently invests available cash and cash equivalents in short term instruments such as certificates of deposit  commercial paper and money market accounts 
although the rate of interest paid on such investments may fluctuate over time  each of the company s investments is made at a fixed interest rate over the duration of the investment 
all of these investments have maturities of less than days 
the company believes its exposure to market risk fluctuations for these investments is not material as of september  financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable 
to reduce its exposure to the credit risks of international customers  with the exception of customers with ownership interests by credit worthy us based companies  the company generally receives payment prior to shipment  receives irrevocable letters of credit that are confirmed by us banks  or purchases commercial credit insurance 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations and charges amounts to operations when they are determined to be uncollectible 
because of the steps taken above to mitigate credit risks of international customers  the company believes that its exposure to credit risk is not material 
to mitigate the effects of currency fluctuations on the company s results of operations  the company conducts all of its international transactions in us dollars
