overview we are a radio frequency rf devices company providing radio frequency products worldwide to communications equipment companies and service providers 
we design  develop and manufacture innovative  high performance products for both current and next generation wireless and wireline networks  defense and homeland security systems and rf identification systems 
our products are comprised of advanced  highly functional rf semiconductors  components and integrated assemblies which seek to address the rf challenges of these various systems 
we have been designing rf devices for more than years and have developed significant expertise in rf design  semiconductor process technology and component integration 
our commercial communications products are used by telecommunication and broadband cable equipment manufacturers supporting and facilitating mobile communications  enhanced voice services  data and image transport 
our objective is to be the leading supplier of innovative rf semiconductors products 
on june   we completed our acquisition of the wireless infrastructure business and associated assets from eic corporation  a california corporation and eic enterprises limited together eic 
the aggregate purchase price was million which included consideration to eic in the form of payments of cash of million and the issuance of  shares of our common stock valued at million  as well as acquisition related costs we incurred of million and  of estimated registration statement related expenses reduced by  related to the termination settlement of the associated supply agreement with eic recognized during our quarter ended december  in connection with the acquisition  million in cash and  shares of common stock have been held in escrow as security against certain financial contingencies 
the outstanding balance of the escrow account less any properly noticed unpaid or contested amounts will be distributed within five days after march  on november  we filed a registration statement registering for resale by the seller of up to  shares of our common stock issued in the acquisition 
in addition to the closing consideration  eic may be entitled to further consideration of up to million in cash and shares of our common stock if certain revenue and gross margin targets are achieved by march  and march  we shall pay eic this additional consideration  if earned  ninety percent in our common stock and ten percent in cash 
the number of shares of our common stock to be delivered shall be determined by dividing the value in dollars of the portion payable in our common stock by the average closing price of our common stock  as quoted on the nasdaq national market  during the ten consecutive trading days ending one trading day before the end of the period covered by the payment  provided  however  that in the event that the calculation of the average closing price results in a price for the first payment that would be less than or for the second payment that would be less than  then we  at our option  in our sole discretion  may elect to make the payment part or all in cash and the balance  if any  in shares of our common stock 
if eic receives such consideration  the amounts will be recorded as an increase to goodwill 
the fair value of our common stock was determined based on the average closing price per share of our common stock over a day period beginning two trading days before and ending two trading days after the amended terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced june  
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

we believe that the addition of eic s technical expertise further enhances wj s strategy of offering customers what we believe to be industry leading products for the wireless infrastructure market 
wj communications  inc formerly watkins johnson company  we  us  our or the company was founded in in palo alto  california  and for many years we focused on rf microwave devices for defense electronics and space communications systems 
beginning in the s  we began applying our rf design  semiconductor technology and integration capabilities to address the growing opportunities for commercial communications products 
we believe that our track record of designing high quality  reliable products and our long standing relationships with industry leading customers are important competitive advantages 
we were originally incorporated in california and reincorporated in delaware in august recent developments on january  we completed our acquisition of telenexus  inc telenexus 
pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger  dated january   by and between us  wj newco  llc the wj sub  telenexus and richard j 
swanson  wilfred k 
lau  david fried  kurt christensen and mark sutton 
telenexus was merged with and into the wj sub effective on january  the wj sub was the survivor in the merger and is our wholly owned subsidiary 
telenexus designs  develops  manufactures and markets radio frequency identification rfid reader products for a broad range of industries and markets 
by virtue of the merger  we purchased through the wj sub all of the assets necessary for the conduct of the rfid business of telenexus  consisting primarily of  and including  but not limited to rfid modules  baseband processing algorithm technology  applications software and realizations of several reader product designs 
the consideration we paid on the closing date in connection with the merger consisted of cash in the amount of million  which was paid out of our cash reserves on the closing date  and  shares of our common stock valued at million at the closing date 
of the closing consideration  cash in the amount of million and  shares of our common stock are being held in escrow with respect to any indemnification matter under the merger agreement 
in addition to the closing consideration  the sellers may be entitled to further compensation of up to up to million in cash and up to  shares of our common stock if we achieve certain revenue targets by july  the fair value of our common stock was determined based on the average closing price per share of our common stock over a day period beginning two trading days before and ending two trading days after the amended terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced january  
messrs 
swanson and lau also entered into three year employment agreements with us 
we believe the addition of telenexus rfid products and technology will allow us to continue to enhance our rfid reader offerings to further capitalize on market opportunity 
sales we sell our products to a broad group of communications original equipment manufacturers oems and their suppliers and subcontractors 
our major customers provide forecasted demand on at least a monthly basis  which assists us in managing our inventory requirements 
these forecasts  however  are subject to changes  including changes as a result of market conditions  and could fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we depend on a small number of customers for a majority of our sales 
sales to our customers which account for more than of our total annual sales were  in aggregate   and of our sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the identity of our customers who contributed greater than of our total sales for each of the preceding three years and the annual amount of those sales  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
we have diversified our customer base over the last few years and intend to further diversify our customer base and product offering in the future 
however  we anticipate that we will continue to sell a majority of our products to a relatively small group of customers 
in addition  most of our sales result from purchase orders or contracts that can be cancelled on short term notice 
delays in manufacturing or supply procurement or other factors  including general market slow downs  have caused and could potentially continue to cause cancellation  reduction or delay in orders by or in shipments to a significant customer 
if the markets for our products in broadband cable or wireless communications decline  fail to grow  or grow more slowly than we anticipate  the use of our products may be reduced with a significant negative impact on our sales  earnings  inventory valuations and cash flow 
revenues from product sales are recognized when all of the following conditions are met the product has been shipped and title has passed to the customer  we have the right to invoice the customer at a fixed price  the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and there are no significant obligations remaining 
generally  title passes upon shipment of our products 
certain contracts are under a consignment arrangement under which title to our products does not pass until the customer utilizes these products in its production processes 
as a consequence  we recognize revenue on these contracts only when the customer notifies us of product consumption 
in addition to our internal sales efforts  we use a sole distributor richardson electronics  ltd 
to sell semiconductor and radio frequency identification rfid products 
revenues from this distributor are recognized upon shipment based on the following factors our sales price is fixed or determinable by contract at the time of shipment  payment terms are fixed at shipment and are consistent with terms granted to other customers  the distributor has full risk of physical loss  the distributor has separate economic substance  we have no obligation with respect to the resale of the distributor s inventory  and we believe we can reasonably estimate the potential returns from our distributor based on their history and our visibility in the distributor s success with its products and into the market place in general 
this agreement expanded our previous relationship and includes provisions for joint marketing and promotional activities such as advertising in trade publications and the planning and execution of technical tours demonstrations and trade shows  including such expenses as rental of space and or equipment  travel and posters 
we directly compensate vendors for the cost of these specifically identified goods or services or may reimburse richardson electronics  ltd 
if they incurred the cost of such specifically identified goods or services on our behalf the value of which is substantied by invoicing from vendors 
our cost for these activities is recorded in selling and administrative expense as advertising 
based on specific terms of the customer contract or purchase order  we may negotiate a final delivery and settlement in connection with customer order cancellations 
due to the uncertain and lengthy nature of these negotiations  a substantial portion  if not all  of the inventory subject to the cancellation may be written off 
in the first quarter of  we completed a fixed wireless contract with one customer resulting in million of sales for final product delivery 
substantially all of this inventory had been written off in in the second quarter of  we completed our largest long haul fiber optic contract for our oc dielectric resonator oscillator dro resulting in million of sales 
the inventory sold had been previously written down by million to an adjusted cost basis of million in the first quarter of the resulting margin was similar to other deliveries of this product 
in the future  we anticipate that similar arrangements for final deliveries could be made with other customers upon completion of major contracts  however there can be no assurance that this will occur 
generally  the selling prices of our products decrease over time as a result of increased volumes or general competitive pressures 
we expect that prices will continue to decline as a result of volume increases or these competitive pressures 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct material costs of product components  production wages  taxes and benefits  costs of assembly and test by third party contract manufacturers  wafer costs from third party semiconductor foundries  labor contracted on a temporary basis  supplies consumed in the manufacturing process  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing and test equipment and leasehold improvements  lease expense for our manufacturing facilities  allocated occupancy costs  scrapped material used in the production process  and write downs of excess and obsolete inventory 
we recognize cost of goods sold upon recognition of revenue 
we recognize losses on contracts  including purchase order commitments  when identified 
we have not recognized any such losses during  or operating expenses our operating expenses are classified into two general categories research and development  and selling and administrative 
we classify all charges to these two categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
although each of these two categories includes expenses that are unique to the category type  there are commonly recurring expenditures that are typically included in these categories  such as wages  fringe benefit costs  depreciation and allocated overhead 
research and development research and development expense represents wages  supplies and allocated overhead costs to design  develop and improve products and processes 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expense consists primarily of wages  travel and facility costs incurred by and other expenses allocated to our selling and administrative departments 
selling and administrative expense also includes manufacturer representatives and distributor sales commissions  trade show and advertising expenses and fees and expenses of legal  accounting  and other professional consultants 
amortization of deferred stock compensation we have recorded deferred stock compensation representing the differential between the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and the exercise price for employee stock options 
we are amortizing this amount using the straight line method over the vesting period of the options and stock granted 
recapitalization merger in september we announced the receipt of a proposal from an affiliate  fox paine company llc fox paine to acquire all of the shares of the company s common stock held by unaffiliated stockholders the acquisition proposal 
on march   fox paine withdrew its acquisition proposal 
our and recapitalization merger and other expense is a non recurring expenditure comprised of expenses incurred by the special committee to our board of directors to review the proposal from an affiliate  fox paine company llc to acquire all of the shares of our common stock held by unaffiliated stockholders for per share in cash 
these expenses include legal and financial consulting fees as well as compensation to the members of the special committee 
restructuring charge our restructuring charge reflects our decision to abandon a leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
it is comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and an asset impairment charge on tenant improvements 
in determining this estimate  we have made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and have reflected off setting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate based on the current market conditions 
our restructuring charge reflects further consolidation and abandonment of leased space and associated impairment of tenant improvements  severance costs  an asset impairment charge and the initiation of a program to sell excess manufacturing equipment resulting from the prolonged downturn in the telecommunications industry  especially related to our fiber optics products 
the restructuring charge also includes an additional charge for the leased facility we abandoned in based on our downward revised assumptions regarding sublease occupancy rates and market rates due to an overall deteriorating real estate market and difficulties encountered in subleasing the available space 
also during  we recorded a restructuring charge related to our decision in december to completely outsource our internal wafer fabrication fab within one year 
as a result of the planned fab closure  we accrued associated severance expenses  accrued the eventual abandonment of additional excess space for which we will have a remaining two year commitment and recorded an impairment on our internal wafer fabrication equipment and related leasehold improvements 
during  we revised our lease loss accrual downward for the four month additional operation of our wafer fab and reduced facility costs at our other two abandoned facilities 
this reversal was largely offset by an additional lease loss accrual for reductions in estimated sublease occupancy and market rates and disposal of our remaining unsold assets held for sale 
we also reversed a portion of our severance accrual for one employee slated to be terminated but instead retained for another position 
during  we reversed the lease loss associated with our fab and remaining severance accrual due to our assessment and subsequent decision to not close our fab as we believe that integrating the newly acquired fab from eic with our pre existing fab will offer the company certain benefits over outsourcing the pre existing fab 
this reversal was partially offset by a net increase in the lease loss accrual for our other leased facilities based on reductions in sublease occupancy rates and a net increase in facility operating costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a continuous basis  we evaluate all our significant estimates including those related to doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring including accruals for abandoned lease properties  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for a detailed discussion of all our significant accounting policies 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimations and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  also the brand awareness and the market position of the acquired products and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
this sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
revenues from our distributor are recognized upon shipment based on the following factors our sales price is fixed or determinable by contract at the time of shipment  payment terms are fixed at shipment and are consistent with terms granted to other customers  the distributor has full risk of physical loss  the distributor has separate economic substance  we have no obligation with respect to the resale of the distributor s inventory  and we believe we can reasonably estimate the potential returns from our distributor based on their history and our visibility in the distributor s success with its products and into the market place in general 
we accrue for distributor right of return  authorized price reductions for specific end customer sales opportunities and price protection based on known events and historical trends 
through the amount of those reserves has not been material see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for a detailed discussion of all our revenue reserves 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists  the company accrues a reserve based on its reasonable estimate of future returns based on historical trends and contractual limitations 
per contractual agreement  the distributor may return product three times per year under the following conditions the total value of inventory returned shall not exceed an amount equal to of the total value of the distributor s stock on hand of the company s products as reported in the prior month s inventory report  the inventory is returned no earlier than months and no later than months from the date of the original invoice date and the product s packaging has not been opened or any alteration or modification has been performed on the part 
at the end of any given period  the company reserves revenue equal to of the distributor s current reported inventory and cost of revenue for the associated cost of the estimated returns 
as of december   and  the company s distributor stock rotation reserve was   and  respectively 
beginning in september  the company entered into a program where the distributor would receive a credit if it sold specific product at a reduced price to specific end customers pre authorized by the company 
the company maintains a log of all such pre authorized price reductions which it accrues as a reduction to revenue in the period that the pre authorization occurs per issue of eitf accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
as of december   and  the company s ship debit allowance was   and  respectively 
if the company reduces the prices of its products as negotiated with the distributor  the distributor may receive a credit for the difference between the price paid by the distributor and the reduced price on applicable unsold products remaining in the distributor s inventory on the effective date of the price reduction assuming that inventory is less than months old as determined by the original invoice date 
the company reserves for distributor price protection per issue of eitf based on specific identification of company initiated price reductions and the associated reported distributor inventory 
there has been no such price reductions during  or write down of excess and obsolete inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production generally based on a rolling eighteen month demand forecast  current economic trends and historical write offs when evaluating the valuation of our inventory 
due to rapidly changing customer forecasts and orders  additional write downs of excess or obsolete inventory  while not currently expected  could be required in the future 
in addition  the sale of previously written down inventory could result from significant unforeseen increases in customer demand 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate our intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets include goodwill and purchased technology 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value  and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
if an impairment charge is recognized  the amortization related to intangible assets would decrease during the remainder of the fiscal year 
income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies we have established reserves for income tax contingencies 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by tax authorities including our tax filings for to the reserves represent our best estimate of the probable amount for our liability of income taxes  interest and penalties 
the actual liability could differ significantly from the amount of the reserve  which could have a material effect on our results of operations 
the tax benefit for the year ended december  of million resulted from a revision of our estimated income tax contingency liability due to our receipt of the final assessment from the internal revenue service related to the audit of the company s through tax returns 
in addition  as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax provision benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current income tax provision benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
restructuring during fiscal and  we recorded significant restructuring charges representing the direct costs of exiting certain product lines or businesses and the costs of downsizing our business 
such charges were established in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
these charges include abandoned leased properties comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and asset impairment charges on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
in determining these estimates  we make certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflect offsetting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
should there be a further significant change in market conditions  the ultimate losses on these could be higher and such amount could be material 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to restructuring activities initiated in and also recorded additional charges of million related to restructuring activities initiated in  primarily due to changes in estimated sublease income 
during  we revised our lease loss accrual downward for an estimated four months of additional operation of our wafer fab and reduced facility costs at our other two abandoned facilities 
this reversal was largely offset by an additional lease loss accrual for reductions in estimated sublease occupancy and market rates 
during  we recorded a reversal of million related to our assessment and subsequent decision to not close our internal wafer fabrication facility fab as we believe that integrating the newly acquired fab from eic with our pre existing fab will offer the company certain benefits over outsourcing the pre existing fab 
as such  we reversed million of our lease loss accrual and  of our severance accrual 
this credit was partially offset by an additional  lease loss accrual as we revised our lease loss assumptions for our facilities based on reductions in sublease occupancy rates and a net increase in facility operating costs 
the leased property abandonments have resulted in an average per year benefit of million in reduced lease expense and  in reduced amortization of leasehold improvements which will continue through the leased property abandonments had no effect on our future cash flows 
the collective asset impairments have resulted in an average per year benefit of million in reduced depreciation expense of manufacturing equipment which will continue over the next three years ending in the equipment deemed excess in was ultimately sold for million 
otherwise  the asset impairments had no effect on our future cash flows 
the workforce reductions have resulted reduced wages and benefits of million per year with a corresponding reduction in cash flows 
in total the restructuring plans have benefited our results of operations on average as follows since million reduction in cost of goods sold  million reduction in research and development expense and million reduction in selling and administrative expense 
except for changes in the sublease estimates noted above  actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the restructuring charge 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant technological changes  which would render equipment and manufacturing processes obsolete 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of these assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of our long lived assets could occur 
current operations the following table sets forth certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 
as a result of our new products  changing market conditions and other factors  the historical percentages and comparisons set forth below may not reflect our expected future operations

the increase in sales from to primarily reflects the increase in our semiconductor and radio frequency identification rfid sales which more than offset the decline in our wireless integrated assembly sales 
the decline in sales from to primarily reflects the decline in our wireless integrated assembly sales as these products neared the end of their product life cycle as well as our strategic decisions in to focus on our competitive advantages and dedicate our resources to the radio frequency rf semiconductor market by selling our wireless repeater and thin film product lines and exiting the fixed wireless assembly and fiber optics markets 
semiconductor and rfid sales during totaled million  representing of total sales which was a million or increase in comparison to sales of million of total sales and our semiconductor and rfid sales increased million or in comparison to sales of million of total sales 
our semiconductor and rfid sales included sales of our thin film products which represents  and million for and  respectively 
in may we sold our thin film product line to m a com a unit of tyco electronics 
excluding sales of our thin film products  our semiconductor and rfid sales increased million or to million in and million or to million in from million in the increase in our semiconductor and rfid sales during related to an increase in the volume of products sold due  in part  to our introduction of over new products including our mpr family of pcmcia form factor uhf rfid readers and our power amplifier modules for pas phs telecommunication networks in china  our expanded product offering due to our acquisition of the wireless infrastructure business from eic corporation representing million of our semiconductor and rfid sales in and our increasing sales in the united states increase in and asia particularly china  which increased in 
during our average selling price of our semiconductor products increased by approximately due to new product introductions 
approximately  of our semiconductor and rfid sales resulted from sales of product to eic under a supply agreement we entered into with them as part our acquisition of their wireless infrastructure business and associated assets 
this supply agreement was substantially completed by december  and there will be no significant sales from these products in future periods 
the increase in our semiconductor and rfid sales from to related to an increase in the volume of our products sold due  in part  to our introduction of over new products and our increasing sales in asia particularly china  which in the aggregate accounted for of total sales in and compared to in 
this increase was mitigated by an approximate decrease in the average selling price of our products due to competitive pressure 
wireless integrated assembly sales for totaled million  representing of total sales and a decrease of million or from sales of million of total sales in our wireless integrated assembly sales decreased million or from sales of million in  or of total sales 
the decrease in wireless integrated assembly sales in and related to a drop in the volume of our wireless integrated assembly products sold as these products have reached the end of their product life cycle 
lucent technologies was the major customer for our wireless integrated assembly products 
during  they decided to design the next generation of this type of product themselves and build it through the use of contract manufacturers 
during our third quarter ended september   they notified us that they would no longer purchase significant quantities of these products and might only purchase moderate quantities for their customers who may need to expand or maintain older telecommunications networks 
we made the decision in early to exit the fixed wireless assembly market 
wireless integrated assembly sales for included million for final product delivery of our last major fixed wireless contract 
the decline in our wireless integrated assembly sales  including fixed wireless assembly sales  over the last two years contributed to the decline in our sales to europe 
as these products have reached the end of their product life cycle  they will not be a significant factor in our long term business 
aside from potential and infrequent life time buys  our focus will predominantly be supporting the existing product base 
fiber optic sales were  in  representing less than of total sales 
we exited the fiber optic market in mid based on the protracted lack of demand for long haul fiber optic products 
fiber optic sales in and represents sales of residual inventory  primarily manufactured in prior years 
fiber optic sales in totaled  compared to million of total sales in this decline in fiber optic sales was caused by the decline in our sales to nortel networks who was the predominat customer for these products 
the decline also caused the decline in our sales to canada and contributed to the decline in our sales to europe 
there will be no more sales from our fiber optic products in future periods 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold for was million  a decrease of  or as compared with cost of goods sold of million in as a percentage of sales  our cost of goods sold decreased to in from in this decrease in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales reflects the change in our product sales mix to a greater percentage of higher margin semiconductor products from relatively lower margin wireless assembly products 
this reduction in direct costs was partially offset by increased indirect cost of goods sold of  for manufacturing supplies   for equipment maintenance and  for increased manufacturing support staff all due to increased volume production including the product lines we acquired from eic 
in absolute dollars  the decrease in cost of goods sold reflects the factors previously noted 
our cost of goods sold was million in as a percentage of sales  our cost of goods sold decreased to of sales in from in this decrease in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for reflects the change in our product sales mix to a greater percentage of higher margin semiconductor products from relatively lower margin wireless assembly products and the cost reductions generated by our restructuring program implemented in our third quarter of including reductions in wages and benefits  rent  and depreciation expenses 
these reduced costs were partially offset by additional expenses incurred to transition our semiconductor manufacturing processes to outside foundries 
in absolute dollars  the decrease in our cost of goods sold reflects the factors previously noted as well as our decline in sales during we continue to experience unabsorbed overhead costs related to underutilization of our existing wafer fabrication facilities  including the facility and related equipment acquired from eic 
while prior restructuring programs have mitigated some of our unabsorbed overhead through the write down of excess facilities and equipment  we will still have fixed manufacturing costs that these efforts will not impact until we can further reduce excess capacity 
we typically generate a lower gross margin on new product introductions which we expect to be a higher percentage of our sales mix going forward 
over time  we typically become more efficient relative to new products through learning and increased volumes as well as through improved yields 
new product lines also contain a greater degree of inventory risk due to uncertainty regarding a lack of visibility and predictability of customer demand and potential competition 
research and development our research and development for was million  an increase of  or as compared with research and development expense of million in our research and development expense decreased by million or as compared with our research and development expense of million for the increase in absolute dollars in is primarily related to the increased engineering staff and new product development efforts related to the products and processes we acquired from eic and increased spending on design consulting services which was largely offset by a decrease in overall overhead 
research and development efforts in were primarily attributable to spending on the development of our radio frequency identification rfid reader asic wtx  our mpr family of pcmcia form factor uhf rfid readers and our power amplifier modules for pas phs telecommunication networks in china 
the decrease in absolute dollars in is primarily related to a decrease in procured materials used in our research and development 
research and development efforts in and were primarily attributable to spending on the overall development of rf semiconductor products 
during  we greatly increased our expenditures on rf semiconductor development projects while significantly reducing or eliminating development efforts on other product lines 
during  research and development expenses were as a percentage of sales which compares to in and in the decrease in research and development expense as a percentage of sales from to is primarily related to our increase in sales 
the increase in research and development expense as a percentage of sales from to relates to our decline in sales 
product research and development is essential to our future success and we expect to continue to make investments in new product development and engineering talent 
in we will focus our research efforts and resources on rf semiconductor development which target multiple growth markets such as rfid and defense and homeland security and while expanding our addressable market opportunities in wireless communications and broadband cable 
we will also explore process capabilities of third party foundries and develop products under new process technologies such as sige bicmos 
in absolute dollars  we expect our research and development expenditures to remain relatively constant with the prior year 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expense for was million or of sales  an increase of million or as compared with selling and administrative expense of million or of sales in the increase in absolute dollars during is primarily related to a  increase in salaries and wages due to an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel   increase in severance due to a stock compensation charge resulting from the modification of two option agreements extension of the option exercise period  a  increase in accounting fees resulting from additional corporate governance requirements   increase in commission costs due to increased sales of our radio frequency rf semiconductor products and a  increase in bonus expense 
additionally  during  we benefited from a reduction in our board of directors compensation plan which was approved at our annual meeting of stockholders held on july  and resulted in a reduction in accrued expenses of  also  had benefited from the collection of  of receivables which had been reserved in a prior period 
during  we reserved  of receivables whose collection is doubtful 
these increased costs were partially offset by a  reduction in our directors and officers and liability insurance premiums and a  decrease in advertising and promotion costs 
selling and administrative expense for was million or of sales  a decrease of  or as compared with selling and administrative expense of million or of sales in the decrease in absolute dollars is primarily related to  of cost reductions generated by our restructuring program implemented in our third quarter of including reductions in wages and benefits  rent and tax expenses 
additionally  we benefited from a  reduction in our board of directors compensation plan that was approved at our annual meeting of stockholders held on july  these reduced expenses were partially offset by a  increase in insurance premiums  a  increase in commission costs due to increased sales of our rf semiconductor products and a  increase in bonus expense 
as a percentage of sales  the increase in selling and administrative expenses from to reflects the factors noted above 
as a percentage of sales  the increase in selling and administrative expenses from to reflects our decline in sales over that period 
acquired in process research and development expenses during  million of the purchase price for the acquisition of the wireless infrastructure business and associated assets from eic was allocated to acquired in process research and development expense iprd 
projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no future alternative use 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is minimal remaining risk relating to the development 
the iprd charge related to the eic acquisition which was made up of two projects v heterojunction bipolar transistor hbt power amplifiers and v hbt high power amplifiers which had an assigned value of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we have completed both the v and v hbt high power amplifier process development projects 
the value of these projects was determined by estimating the discounted net cash flows from the sale of the products resulting from the completion of the projects  reduced by the portion of the revenue attributable to developed technology and the percentage of completion of the project 
actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisition 
the assumptions consist primarily of expected completion dates for the iprd projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections for the products once they have entered the market 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in process research and development into commercially viable products principally relates to the completion of all prototyping and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can meet its design specification including function  features and technical performance requirements 
therefore  the amount allocated to in process research and development has been charged to operations 
amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of   and  for  and  respectively  is related to the issuance of employee stock options at prices deemed below fair market value 
included in the total deferred stock compensation described above is   and  for  and  respectively  which is included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations 
the increase in amortization of deferred stock compensation expense during was attributable to the issuance of  employee stock options for a purchase price of per share which was less than the fair value of common stock at the date of grant 
as of december   the balance of our remaining unamortized deferred stock compensation was  to be amortized over the next months 
recapitalization merger we incurred recapitalization merger expense of  in and  in related to our consideration of the proposed fox paine transaction 
on september   we announced the receipt of a proposal from an affiliate  fox paine company llc fox paine to acquire all of the shares of our common stock held by unaffiliated stockholders the acquisition proposal 
at that time  fox paine and its affiliates owned approximately of our outstanding shares or million shares of a total of million shares outstanding 
our board of directors formed a special committee composed of two independent directors not affiliated with fox paine the special committee to review the acquisition proposal 
these expenses include legal and financial consulting fees as well as compensation to the members of the special committee 
on march   fox paine withdrew its acquisition proposal 
restructuring charges during  we reversed the lease loss associated with our internal wafer fabrication facility fab and remaining severance accrual due to our assessment and subsequent decision to not close our fab as we believe that integrating the newly acquired fab from eic with our pre existing fab will offer the company certain benefits over outsourcing the pre existing fab 
this reversal was partially offset by a net increase in the lease loss accrual for our other leased facilities based on reductions in sublease occupancy rates and a net increase in facility operating costs 
in  we revised our lease loss accrual downward for the four month additional operation of our wafer fab and reduced facility costs at our other two abandoned facilities 
this reversal was largely offset by an additional lease loss accrual for reductions in estimated sublease occupancy and market rates and disposal of our remaining unsold assets held for sale 
we also reversed a portion of our severance accrual for one employee slated to be terminated but instead retained for another position 
for  we recorded a restructuring charge of million reflecting consolidation and abandonment of leased space and associated impairment of tenant improvements  severance costs  an asset impairment charge and the initiation of a program to sell excess manufacturing equipment resulting from the prolonged downturn in the telecommunications industry  especially related to our fiber optics products 
in the third quarter of  we decided to abandon a portion of our leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
this excess space  for which we had a remaining eight year commitment  is located on the first floor of our current corporate headquarters and originally housed a portion of our optics and integrated assemblies manufacturing operations 
this decision resulted in a lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and an asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
in determining this estimate  we made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflected offsetting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
in addition  our management made a decision during the third quarter of to exit the fiber optics business after current contractual obligations had been satisfied 
this decision resulted in a significant overcapacity of certain manufacturing equipment and we initiated a plan to sell this equipment before the end of the first quarter of our excess manufacturing equipment resulted in a total charge of million 
assets to be held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
management determined fair market value after consideration of several factors including the condition of the equipment  offers made by potential buyers of the equipment and the results of an independent third party appraisal 
the majority of these impaired assets was sold in the fourth quarter of also during the third quarter of  our management identified manufacturing equipment exclusively supporting certain in warranty optics and fixed wireless products as well as manufacturing equipment supporting final orders for certain other optics and fixed wireless products and determined that the estimated future cash flows did not support the carrying value of these assets 
as such  the carrying value of these assets were written down to the estimated future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of these assets  which management determined after consideration of several factors including the condition and management s intended use of the equipment  offers made for similar equipment the company intended to sell and the results of an independent third party appraisal 
this action resulted in a  asset impairment charge 
during  we incurred severance expense of  related to a reduction of employees 
also during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to our decision in december to completely outsource our internal wafer fabrication 
as a result of the planned closure of our wafer fabrication facility  approximately of the company s workforce employees would have been eliminated  which would have resulted in severance payments of  the closure of this facility would have resulted in additional excess space of approximately  square feet for which we had a remaining two year commitment at that time 
this decision resulted in a lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs 
in determining this estimate  we made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflected offsetting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
this decision triggered an impairment analysis under sfas no 
management measured the recoverability of these assets through a comparison of the carrying amount of these assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets over their remaining year of life 
as such  the carrying value of these assets were written down to the estimated future cash flows that are directly associated with and that were expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of these assets 
management estimated the future cash flows using a traditional present value approach based on management s assumptions regarding the intended use of these assets consistent with the company s budget and projections as well as the planned eventual disposition of the asset group through sale 
management estimated the disposition value of these assets after consideration of several factors including the condition and management s intended use of the equipment  offers made for similar equipment the company intended to sell and the results of an independent third party appraisal 
management employed a risk free interest rate commensurate with the company s size  capital structure and stock volatility in relation to the overall market 
this action resulted in a million asset impairment charge 
for  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to our decision to abandon an excess facility 
in september  we decided not to occupy a new leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
this excess facility  for which we had a ten year commitment  is located adjacent to our current corporate headquarters and was originally developed to house additional administrative and corporate offices to accommodate planned expansion 
this decision resulted in a pre tax lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and a pre tax asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
the restructuring charge also includes an additional charge for the leased facility we abandoned in based on our downward revised assumptions regarding sublease occupancy rates and market rates due to an overall deteriorating real estate market and difficulties subleasing our available space 
in determining this estimate  we made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflected off setting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of the current market conditions

interest income interest income primarily represents interest earned on cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments 
our interest income for was  a decrease of  or as compared with interest income of  in  which decreased by  or compared with interest income of million in these decreases primarily resulted from decreased average amounts of funds available for investment 
additionally  our interest income will be impacted by changes in the market interest rates of our investments 
interest expense our interest expense for was  a decrease of  or as compared with interest expense of  in and a decrease of  or as is compared with interest expense of  in interest expense for all periods relates to fees associated with our revolving credit facility and outstanding letters of credit 
other income net the other income realized in was primarily related to a million gain we recorded related to the sale of our thin film product line 
the sale includes equipment  inventory  intellectual property  training and services for which we received total proceeds of million 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
income tax benefit the tax benefit for of million resulted from a revision of our estimated income tax contingency liability due to our receipt of the final assessment from the internal revenue service related to the audit of the company s through tax returns 
in  we recorded a tax benefit of  related to an income tax refund of  from the state of maryland as the result of amending our state tax return and an adjustment to our tax contingency liability of  for additional federal income tax refund determined after finalizing our carryback claim filed in the first quarter of and miscellaneous tax payments 
beginning in  it was determined that it was not more likely than not that any additional deferred tax assets were realizable 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were million  a decrease of million or compared to the balance of million at december  in december of  we entered into a revolving credit facility revolving facility with a bank  the terms of which were amended and restated in september under the new terms  the revolving facility provides for a maximum credit extension of million with a million sub limit to support letters of credit and matures on september  interest rates on outstanding borrowings are periodically adjusted based on certain financial ratios and are initially set  at our option  at libor plus or prime minus 
the revolving facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and contains limitations on  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  pay dividends and make acquisitions without the bank s permission 
the revolving facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
we were in compliance with the covenants as of december  as of december  and  there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility 
the company has letters of credit of million outstanding as of december  against which no amounts have been drawn 
net cash provided used by operating activities net cash provided used by operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net loss in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
significant items impacting the difference between net loss and cash flows used in operations in were million used in working capital and million related to a decrease in our income tax liability 
the million used in working capital primarily relates to a million increase in receivables  a million decrease in restructuring liabilities  a million increase in other assets and a decrease of  in income taxes payable 
our receivables increased million due to increased shipments during the fourth quarter of the million decrease in restructuring liabilities primarily relates to payments against the remaining lease loss accrual 
the increase in other assets of million is primarily due to a  accrual of a settlement related to the termination of the supply agreement with eic see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k and a  increase in accrued interest receivable related to our investments 
the decrease of  in income taxes payable relates to payments resulting from an audit of our through returns 
the million decrease in our tax contingency liability resulted from a revised estimate of our tax contingency liability related to the audit of our through tax returns as a result of our receipt of the final assessment from the internal revenue service 
significant items impacting the difference between net loss and cash flows from operations in were  used in working capital and million provided by the realization of deferred tax assets 
the  used in working capital primarily relates to a million decrease in restructuring liabilities  which was offset by a million decrease in inventories 
the million decrease in inventories relates to the decrease in our sales from million in to million in the million provided by the realization of deferred tax assets relates to the receipt of an income tax refund generated by the carryback of our net operating loss 
starting in the second quarter of  we were required to offer more favorable payment terms to significant customers in order to remain competitive in the current business environment 
as a result  our average payment terms have increased from days to days  which has had a negative impact to our working capital 
significant items impacting the difference between net loss and cash flows from operations in were million provided by working capital  a million increase in our restructuring accrual and million provided by the realization of deferred tax assets 
the million provided by working capital primarily relates to a million decrease in inventories and a million decrease in receivables which were partially offset by a million decrease in accruals and accounts payable 
the decreases in inventories and receivables both relate to the decrease in our sales from million in to million in the decrease in accruals  accounts payable and income taxes payable was primarily due to decreased inventory levels and purchases resulting from lower sales volumes and more restrictive spending efforts  as well as headcount reductions realized as part of our restructuring efforts 
the million provided by the realization of deferred tax assets relates to the receipt of an income tax refund generated by the carryback of our net operating loss 
net cash provided used by investing activities net cash provided used by investing activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
in  we realized million in proceeds from the sale of short term investments which was partially offset by million used to purchase short term investments  million of acquisition and costs related to the eic transaction see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k and  to invest in property  plant and equipment 
in  we used million to purchase short term investments and  to invest in property  plant and equipment which was partially offset by million provided by our sale of short term investments and million proceeds from the sale of our thin film product line see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
in  we realized million in proceeds from the sale of short term investments and million in proceeds from sales of equipment which was partially offset by million used to purchase short term investments and million to invest in property  plant and equipment 
during  we expect to invest approximately to million in capital expenditures 
we have funded our capital expenditures from cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and expect to continue to do so throughout net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled million   and  in  and  respectively 
in  we received net proceeds of million related to our secondary public offering of million newly issued shares of our common stock and million from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and option plans which was partially offset by  of cash used to repurchase our common stock under our current stock repurchase program see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the form k 
in  we received net cash of million from the sale of our common stock to employees through our option plans which was partially offset by million of cash used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the form k 
in  we received net cash of  from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and option plans 
based on our current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments together with available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  we will utilize our cash  cash flows and borrowings to the extent available and  if desirable or necessary  we may seek to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity 
there can be no assurances  however  that future borrowings and capital resources will be available on favorable terms or at all 
our cash flows are highly dependent on demand for our products  timing of orders and shipments with key customers and our ability to manage our working capital  especially inventory and accounts receivable  as well as controlling our production and operating costs in line with our revenue 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total we lease our three facilities  including our executive offices in san jose  california  under lease agreements that expire at various dates through total future lease obligations as of december   were million  of which million was recorded as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our restructuring accrual current and long term 
purchase obligations are primarily orders for raw material  processed silicon wafers and assembly and test services 
while the purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty  certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service 
we expect to receive and pay for these materials and services within the next six months 
the only component of other long term liabilities that requires us to make cash payments is a restructuring accrual of million relating to the future operating lease payments on certain facilities that were included in our restructuring plans see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
we will make these payments through we included these amounts in the operating lease total in the table above 
excluding payments under the operating lease component included in the restructuring accrual  the other components of other long term liabilities do not contractually require us to make cash payments and primarily consist of estimated operating costs on restructured facilities  deferred rent and estimated environmental costs 
the table above does not include contractual obligations related to our acquisition in june of the wireless infrastructure business and associated assets from eic corporation or our acquisition in january of telenexus  inc as the additional consideration is contingent on certain future identifiable events which have not occurred as of december  eic may be entitled to further consideration of up to million in cash and shares of our common stock if certain revenue and gross margin targets are achieved by march  and march  we shall pay eic this additional consideration  if earned  ninety percent in our common stock and ten percent in cash 
thus  if earned   would be payable in less than one year and  would be payable in one to three years 
the sellers of telenexus  inc may be entitled to further compensation of up to million in cash and up to  shares of our common stock if we achieve certain revenue targets by july  thus  if earned  million would be payable in one to three years 
certain employment agreements which may require us to pay out termination benefits upon future identifiable events are also excluded from the table above as no events have occurred as of december   which make a payment probable 
for purposes of the table above  obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we have additional purchase orders not included in the table above that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
other matters recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the issue s objective is to provide guidance for identifying other than temporarily impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp eitf that delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf until further notice 
the disclosure requirements of eitf were effective with this annual report for fiscal once the fasb reaches a final decision on the measurement and recognition provisions  we will evaluate the impact of the adoption of the accounting provisions of eitf disclosures for cost method investments are required in annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after june  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for the required disclosures 
in september  the eitf reached a consensus regarding issue no 
 accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination eitf 
eitf requires an acquirer in a business combination to evaluate any preexisting relationship with the acquiree to determine if the business combination in effect contains a settlement of the preexisting relationship 
a business combination between parties with a preexisting relationship should be viewed as a multiple element transaction 
eitf is effective for business combinations after october   but requires goodwill resulting from prior business combinations involving parties with a preexisting relationship to be tested for impairment by applying the guidance in the consensus 
we will apply eitf to acquisitions subsequent to the effective date and in our future goodwill impairment testing 
in november  fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that 


under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 



this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and is required to be adopted by us effective january  we are currently determining what effect  if any  the provisions of sfas no 
will have on our operating results or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp fas 
in accordance with fsp fas  the company will treat the deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities as a reduction of the income tax provision in future years as realized 
the deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities did not impact our consolidated financial statements in  and this deduction is not expected to have a material impact on our effective tax rate in in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we account for stock based compensation awards issued to employees using the intrinsic value measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees opinion 
accordingly  no compensation expense has been recorded for stock options granted with exercise prices greater than or equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the option grant date 
on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of opinion to stock compensation awards issued to employees 
rather  the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
we have not yet quantified the effects of the adoption of sfas r  but we expect that the new standard may result in significant stock based compensation expense 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of original sfas on stock compensation awards rather than applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of opinion are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k under the caption stock based compensation 
although such pro forma effects of applying original sfas may be indicative of the effects of adopting sfas r  the provisions of these two statements differ in some important respects 
the actual effects of adopting sfas r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model chosen by us to value stock based awards  the assumed award forfeiture rate  the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition method as described below chosen for adopting sfas r 
sfas r will be effective for our fiscal quarter beginning july   and requires the use of the modified prospective application method 
under this method sfas r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas in addition  companies may use the modified retrospective application method 
this method may be applied to all prior years for which the original sfas was effective or only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption 
if the modified retrospective application method is applied  financial statements for prior periods shall be adjusted to give effect to the fair value based method of accounting for awards on a consistent basis with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods under the original sfas environmental matters of our former production facilities  two have known environmental liabilities of significance  the scotts valley site and the palo alto site 
prior to the recapitalization merger  we entered into and funded fixed price remediation contracts  as well as cost overrun and unknown pollution conditions liability coverage  with respect to both these sites 
for a more detailed description  see business environmental matters 
litigation we currently are involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business and expect that we will be involved in other litigation and regulatory proceedings from time to time 
while we currently believe that any adverse outcome of such pending matters will not materially affect our business or financial condition  there can be no assurance that this will ultimately be the case 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
cash  cash equivalents and investments cash and cash equivalents consist of municipal bond funds and commercial paper acquired with remaining maturity periods of days or less and are stated at cost plus accrued interest which approximates market value 
short term investments consist primarily of high grade debt securities a rating or better with maturity greater than days from the date of acquisition and are classified as available for sale 
short term investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax  until realized 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will rise or fall in value if market interest rates change 
they are also subject to short term market risk 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio and constitutes a forward looking statement 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted expected maturity average interest expected maturity dates amounts rate in thousands cash equivalents short term investments fair value at december
