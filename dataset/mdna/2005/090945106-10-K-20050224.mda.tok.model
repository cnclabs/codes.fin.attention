overview founded in  biosite incorporated is a leading 
bio medical 
company commercializing proteomics discoveries for the advancement of medical diagnosis 
we believe that our novel  rapid medical diagnostic products  largely evolved from an intensive study of protein biomarkers of disease  can contribute to improvements in medical care by aiding physicians in the diagnosis of critical diseases and health conditions 
in selecting market opportunities  we primarily target highly prevalent diseases that are poorly diagnosed by existing technologies 
currently  we offer diagnostic products for drug screening  heart attack  congestive heart failure  or chf  acute coronary syndromes  or acs  evaluation of shortness of breath and certain bacterial and parasitic infections 
our products are principally sold to acute care hospitals  which number approximately  in the united states 
to market our products  we utilize a direct sales team that focuses its efforts primarily on larger centers with more than beds and smaller hospitals that are high volume users of our products 
we also use a network of distributors both in the united states and internationally 
the fisher healthcare division of the fisher scientific company  or fisher  distributes our products primarily in hospitals in the united states and supports our direct sales force  particularly in smaller hospitals 
we have a distribution agreement with fisher that extends through december  sales to fisher represented and of our product sales in and  respectively 
we utilize distributor relationships with physician sales services  or pss  and henry schein  inc  or henry schein  to market our products to physician office laboratories in the united states 
in international markets  we have established direct selling efforts in several countries and utilize a network of country specific and regional distributors in other areas 
during and  we initiated direct sales and distribution operations in france  germany  belgium and luxembourg  the united kingdom and italy 
in the future  we may transition to direct sales and distribution of our products in additional countries 
we also employ a field based network of clinically experienced individuals that support our direct sales force by providing pre and post sale education and training 
our product sales for were million  representing a increase over this growth resulted largely from increased sales of our triage bnp test products  which are primarily used to aid in the diagnosis of chf 
our meter based triage bnp test  launched domestically in january  was the first blood test available to aid in the detection of chf and benefited from a semi exclusive position in the market  until the entry of direct competition in june in december  we received clearance from the united states food and drug administration  or fda  to market our triage bnp test for beckman coulter immunoassay systems and began selling the product in the united states in january as a result  a customer can perform b type natriuretic peptide  or bnp  testing using either our rapid  portable triage meterplus system or any of beckman coulter inc s automated immunoassay systems 
today  our triage bnp test products are among several fda cleared blood products for use as an aid in the diagnosis of chf 
these include products from bayer healthcare  dade behring  roche diagnostics and abbott laboratories  which offer products based on large  centralized automated testing platforms 
we have experienced  and continue to experience  competition from these companies and anticipate competition from others in the future 
our competitors may succeed in developing or marketing products that are more effective or more commercially attractive than the triage bnp tests 
moreover  we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully with these and other competitors in the future 
with several diagnostic products commercialized  our focus has expanded to include the search for proprietary disease markers that can potentially be applied to our testing platforms or to platforms marketed by other diagnostic companies with whom we might collaborate 
to that end  in we launched biosite discovery 
through biosite discovery  we leverage our expertise in phage display antibody development to access protein targets via collaborations with clinical institutions or commercial companies  or via our internal research and licensing programs 
biosite discovery has also attracted the interest of leading clinical collaborators  who provide patient samples and assist in the analysis of clinical data 
the discovery of new disease markers and the extension of applications for existing products could enable us to expand our product sales into other healthcare market segments 
we have reported consecutive quarterly operating profits since the third quarter of  after incurring quarterly operating losses during the prior seven quarters 
our operating results may fluctuate on a quarterly or annual basis in the future and our growth or operating results may not be consistent with predictions made by us or by securities analysts 
we may not be able to maintain profitability in the future 
some of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business and future operating results are discussed below under the heading liquidity and capital resources  and the section entitled risk factors in item  business  of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies involving management estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates  and related disclosures  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition 
we recognize product sales upon shipment  including to fisher and our other distributors  unless there are significant post delivery obligations or collection is not considered probable at the time of shipment 
generally  we do not have any significant post delivery obligations associated with our product sales 
we accrue for warranty costs and other allowances at the time of shipment based on historical experience  trends and estimates 
our collaborative development agreements generally contain specific payments for specific activities or elements of the agreements 
among the payments we might receive under the agreements are up front technology access fees  research funding  antibody development fees upon the delivery of antibodies  annual maintenance fees on targets for which we have produced antibodies for as long as the targets remain in development by our collaborators  milestone fees on drug targets that reach certain development milestones and royalties should products successfully be commercialized as a result of the collaboration 
up front technology access fees are recognized over the term of the agreement or ongoing research period  as applicable  unless we have no further continuing performance obligations related to the fees 
research funding is recognized over the applicable research period on a straight line basis  which approximates the underlying performance 
milestone payments  such as antibody development fees and clinical milestones  are recognized when earned  as the milestone events are substantive and their achievability is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement 
contract revenues that are based on the performance of and collection by our collaborators or their partners are deferred until such performance is complete and collection is probable 
we believe that each payment element of these agreements represents the fair value of the element at the date of the agreement 
the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
we believe that our revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 
warranty reserves 
our warranty reserve primarily relates to warranty coverage extended with the placement of the triage meterplus 
the triage meterplus is manufactured by lre technology partners gmbh  or lre  who provides biosite a contractual warranty against manufacturer s defects and poor workmanship 
should a meter not function to specification and the cause is determined to be due to a manufacturer s defect or poor workmanship  the malfunctioning meter would be returned to lre for replacement or repair 
lre would incur and bear all the cost to replace or repair the meter 
we have established a warranty allowance for the costs to replace or repair meters that would not be covered by lre s warranty 
historical experience and trends detailing returns and replacement activity in total and those that have been covered by lre s manufacturer s warranty are used in estimating our warranty allowance 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential uncollectible accounts receivable arising from our customers inability to make required payments 
our estimate is determined by analyzing historical bad debts  customer payment history and patterns  customer creditworthiness  and economic  political or regulatory factors affecting the customer s ability to make the required payments 
inventories and related allowances 
net inventories are valued at the lower of the first in  first out  or fifo  cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess  obsolete and potential scrap inventories 
the estimated allowance for excess and obsolete inventories is based on inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales and assumptions about the likelihood of scrap or obsolescence 
during our manufacturing processes  some work in process inventories require additional testing or re work 
these inventories are separately tracked and reviewed on a monthly basis to determine their status and an estimated reserve for potential scrap is calculated 
we utilize a standard cost system to track our inventories on a part by part  full absorption cost basis 
adjustments are made to the standard labor and standard overhead costs to approximate actual labor and actual overhead costs on a fifo cost basis 
intangible and other long lived assets 
at december   we had approximately million of long lived assets  including million of land  million of building construction in progress  million of leasehold improvements  million of equipment  furniture and fixtures  million of deferred taxes and million of capitalized license rights and other assets 
leasehold improvements  equipment  intangible assets and certain other long lived assets are amortized or depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining lease term 
we lease buildings in the united states with leases that expire between march and december useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue directly or indirectly 
license rights related to products for sale are amortized to cost of sales over the life of the license  generally not to exceed years  using a systematic method based on the estimated revenues generated from products during the shorter of the license period or years from the inception of the license 
the estimated revenues used as the base by which we amortize the license rights include only estimated sales for products we are currently selling and do not include any estimated product sales expected to be realized during the license amortization term from products still in development today 
our intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
income tax reserve 
it is our policy to record tax benefits only if we conclude that it is at least probable that the deduction or credit will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
in the period that permanent tax benefits  including research and development tax credits  are generated  we recognize the tax benefits at their estimated net realizable value 
with regard to research tax credits  the determination of qualified expenses and activities involves judgment 
tax authorities have regularly examined and challenged research and development tax credits claimed by companies and have disallowed tax credit amounts based on the tax authorities evaluation and judgment 
we reduce tax benefits to their estimated net realizable value based upon our management s assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences  tax credits and interest expense applied to temporary difference adjustments 
the tax benefits are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustments to the estimate of the net realizable value of the tax benefits 
recent developments triage stroke panel in december  we submitted a pma to the fda for the triage stroke panel 
this product is a rapid immunoassay intended for use as an aid in the assessment and diagnosis of cerebral ischemia  or stroke 
stroke is the third leading cause of death in the united states  resulting in  deaths annually  and is a leading cause of adult disability  according to the american heart association  or aha 
the aha estimates that in  the direct and indirect costs associated with stroke in the united states will exceed billion 
currently  there are no rapid in vitro diagnostic products that aid in the diagnosis of stroke  utilizing protein markers from a blood sample  marketed in the united states 
with symptoms such as unexplained  sudden numbness or weakness  confusion  dizziness and trouble walking and talking  stroke is often mistaken for other illnesses and conditions that have similar clinical presentations 
existing methods to diagnose stroke and confirm symptoms utilize radiographic imaging  such as computed tomography  or ct scan  which are subject to interpretation and often unable to detect the most common form of stroke until to hours after an event 
the triage stroke panel is designed to measure multiple biomarkers and incorporates a unique multimarker index algorithm feature  which analyzes information from all the markers and presents a single composite index result 
like other triage products  the triage stroke panel is designed to generate a quantitative result in approximately minutes using a small sample of blood 
triage profiler cp panel in october  we filed a k with the fda seeking clearances for the triage profiler cp panel 
the triage profiler cp panel incorporates a proprietary multimarker index algorithm which analyzes information from all four markers measured by the panel and presents a single composite index result 
given the proprietary multimarker index algorithm used in the calculation of the composite result  the fda has determined that the device is not substantially equivalent to devices marketed in interstate commerce prior to may  and therefore classified the device by statute into class iii premarket approval 
we believe that the fda s decision to request that we file a pma in no way reflects on the quality of the data we previously submitted  or the perceived diagnostic utility of the multimarker index algorithm 
rather  we believe that the fda s decision was based on the fact that the triage profiler cp panel has new technological characteristics that may not be generally used in medical practice today 
we are working with the fda to build on the clinical data we previously submitted and to determine the appropriate regulatory pathway for this potential product 
triage d dimer test in december  we received clearance from the fda to market the triage d dimer test 
this diagnostic product is intended to be used as an aid in the assessment and evaluation of patients suspected of having thromboembolic events  including pe  a blockage of one or more of the pulmonary arteries by blood clot 
with at least  cases occurring each year in the united states  pe is a common and highly lethal condition that is among the leading causes of death in all age groups 
it is the first or second most common cause of unexpected death in most age groups 
the highest incidence of recognized pe occurs in hospitalized patients 
autopsy results show as many as percent of patients dying in the hospital have had a pe  but the diagnosis has been missed in about percent of the cases 
results of operations years ended december  and product sales 
product sales by product family were as follows in thousands year ended december  increase increase product family decrease decrease cardiovascular products triage bnp test products triage cardiac panel and profiler products triage meterplus products total cardiovascular products other products triage drugs of abuse and tox drug screen products triage microbiology products total other products total product sales product sales for were million  representing an increase of compared with million for the million increase in total product sales consisted of million of product sales growth resulting from an increase in sales volume  and million resulting from an increase in average selling prices of our products 
growth in the sales volume of our triage bnp tests represented of the product sales growth resulting from an increase in sales volume 
as a result of significant fluctuations in customer demand  manufacturing inefficiencies  product improvement efforts and new product scale up activities  inventory levels of our products have been and in the future may be below or above targeted stocking levels 
we adjust our manufacturing capacity by both adjusting the number of production shifts we operate and our production activities  as well as through the implementation of additional manufacturing equipment 
this allows us to modify our production volumes and manufacturing throughput to meet expected customer demand and targeted stocking levels 
product sales to our distributors in future periods will be impacted as we and our distributors attempt to adjust distributors inventories to targeted stocking levels and as we seek to improve our effectiveness and efficiency in adjusting our manufacturing capacity and output 
our product sales are also impacted by the buying patterns of our distributors and other customers 
additionally  we believe that our products are subject to some seasonality in their use 
higher utilization rates of our triage bnp tests may be due to a higher number of ed visits by patients exhibiting shortness of breath  a symptom of congestive heart failure and the flu 
however  higher utilization may also result from greater awareness  education and acceptance of the uses of our triage bnp test products  as well as additional users within the hospitals 
product sales of our cardiovascular products  consisting of our triage bnp tests  triage cardiac panel  triage profiler panels and triage meterplus  totaled million for this represented an increase of as compared with million for the product sales growth of our cardiovascular products for was primarily due to the growth in sales volume of our triage bnp tests which totaled million 
included in the sales volume growth of our triage bnp tests was million related to our triage bnp test for beckman coulter immunoassay systems which we began selling in january our product sales growth rate for our triage bnp tests in future periods may be lower than in the past periods because of increased competition from alternative tests that aid in the diagnosis of chf 
in addition  as the market for bnp testing matures and more competitive products become available  our average sales price for our triage bnp tests may decline 
product sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel  triage tox drug screen  triage c 
difficile panel and triage parasite panel were million for this represented an increase of  compared with million for the increase in sales of these products was primarily due to the million growth in sales volume of our triage tox drug screen  which was launched in february there was also a million increase in product sales resulting from an increase in our average net selling prices for these products 
we believe that domestic sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel products may decline as the available us market becomes saturated and competitive pressures become more prominent in a maturing market 
contract revenues 
contract revenues consist of revenues associated with our research and development and licensing arrangements  including license fees  milestone revenues  royalties  research funding and antibody fees 
contract revenues for were million  compared with million for contract revenues recognized during and consisted primarily of research funding 
we recognized million of research funding from our alliance with medarex during both and other contract revenues recognized during those periods of and included antibody fees  milestone payments and license fees 
biosite discovery activities are performed  and its costs are incurred  by certain of our research and development teams 
these biosite discovery research and development resources concurrently focus on programs for our partners  which generated our contract revenue  and on internal research and development programs 
costs of the research and development resources performing collaborative and internal biosite discovery activities were approximately million for compared with million for these costs are included in research and development expenses 
cost of product sales and gross profit from product sales 
gross profit from product sales for was million  representing an increase of compared with million for the million increase in gross profits consisted of million that resulted from product sales growth  and million resulting from changes in the gross margins of each of our products 
for and  the gross margins for our cardiovascular products were and  respectively  while our gross margins for our triage drugs of abuse panel and other products were and  respectively 
sales of our cardiovascular products represented of our product sales for  compared with for the overall gross margin for was  compared with in the increase in the overall gross margin was primarily due the changing mix of our products sold with differing gross margins  and greater manufacturing efficiencies generated primarily from higher production volumes and manufacturing output during the manufacture of products sold in compared with although our gross profits may continue to grow  we expect our overall gross margin to fluctuate as a result of the changing mix of products sold with different gross margins  changes in our manufacturing processes or costs and competitive pricing pressures 
any new products that we successfully develop  acquire and sell may change our future gross margins 
manufacturing inefficiencies  including inefficiencies experienced as we attempt to increase or decrease our manufacturing capacity  production volumes and manufacturing output will also impact our gross margins 
our manufacturing overhead costs are spread over the changing production volumes manufactured during a quarter on a first in  first out basis 
we also expect that our fixed occupancy costs will significantly increase as we transition our manufacturing operations to our new corporate complex  which has a much larger manufacturing space than our existing facilities 
we may also incur unexpected costs and expenses in connection with our move from our existing facilities to our new corporate complex  or we may experience unanticipated decreases in productivity and other losses due to inefficiencies relating to this transition  or delays in obtaining any required approvals or clearances from regulatory agencies related to the validation of the manufacturing facilities 
for instance  the scale up of manufacturing at our new corporate complex could result in lower than expected manufacturing output and higher than expected product costs 
in addition  we expect to incur some duplicate facilities expenses  such as rent  during the period of time we transfer our operations to the new corporate complex as we will transfer our operations in stages over a three to six month period 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million in at december   our headcount performing sales  marketing and administrative functions totaled  compared with at december  the increase in sg a expenses was primarily associated with the addition of sales  clinical education and technical service resources in the united states  and higher performance based compensation  such as sales commissions and bonuses based on our financial performance 
our employee related expenses in the united states increased million from to the formation and expansion of our direct sales and distribution operations in france  germany  belgium  luxembourg  italy and the uk resulted in an increase in sg a of million from to expanded sales activities related to our broader product lines and scale up in additional markets such as physician offices  marketing activities relating to new products  and increased administrative costs to support our expanded operations resulted in an increase of million from to we expect sg a expenses in to be higher than in  as we continue to increase our sales  marketing  clinical education  technical service and general administration resources in the united states  as well as continue to build our direct sales  distribution and administrative infrastructure in europe 
a portion of the increase in sales and field support resources occurred during the latter half of the year and is expected to contribute to the growth we anticipate in we also expect other non headcount costs  including sales and marketing program activities for our new products  to grow as our overall operations grow 
the timing of these increased expenditures and their magnitude are primarily dependent on the commercial success and sales growth of our products 
sg a expenses are also expected to increase due to costs associated with our move from our existing facilities to our new corporate complex and higher occupancy costs primarily due to increased square footage at the new corporate complex and  for a period of time  occupancy costs of both facilities 
research and development expenses r d expenses 
research and development  or r d  expenses for were million  representing an increase of compared with million for the increase in r d expenses consisted primarily of a million increase in employee expenses  an increase in consultant  clinical studies and patent related expenses  including involvement in pending interference and opposition proceedings  totaling million  and an increase in supplies used in our r d activities of million 
during  our research and development resources were focused primarily on product development for potential new diagnostic products  including the triage profiler cp panel  triage profiler sob panel  triage d dimer test  triage stroke panel and other diagnostic products for critical health conditions such as sepsis and abdominal pain 
we also focused the development of potential improvements to our existing products  including our triage cardiac panel  and manufacturing processes and research activities associated with biosite discovery 
expenses related to the performance of our obligations associated with earning our contract revenues were incurred by our research and development group and were primarily related to biosite discovery 
we expect r d expenses in to be higher than in and to relate primarily to product development efforts  including the development of potential diagnostic products for acs  sepsis and abdominal pain  clinical studies  including studies associated with potential diagnostic products for stroke and ones related to the exploration and validation of other potential uses for our triage bnp tests  engineering development programs intended to miniaturize the triage meterplus platform and automate and significantly improve manufacturing processes  manufacturing scale up for potential new products  including the triage profiler cp and triage stroke panel  costs associated with fda submissions for the triage profiler cp panel and other products under development  biosite discovery activities  performance based compensation  and costs associated with our move from our existing facilities to our new corporate complex and higher occupancy costs primarily due to increased square footage at the new corporate complex and occupancy of both facilities for a period of time 
the timing of such increased expenditures and their magnitude are primarily dependent on the commercial success and sales growth of our products  as well as the timing and progress of our r d efforts 
license and patent disputes 
expenses associated with license and patent disputes incurred during totaled  we did not incur any such expenses during the expenses consisted of legal costs related to our two pending litigations with roche diagnostics corporation and several of its affiliates 
in november  roche diagnostics corporation and certain of its affiliates filed a complaint in the united states district court southern district of indiana indianapolis division alleging that biosite is infringing two patents  us patent  and us patent  owned by roche and or its affiliates 
we believe these allegations of infringement are without merit and we intend to vigorously contest these claims 
also  in november  we filed a complaint in the united states district court  southern district of california alleging that roche diagnostics corporation and roche diagnostics gmbh are infringing two patents  us patent  and us patent  owned by biosite 
the patents relate to methods for the measurement of cardiac troponin forms 
we believe that our claims have merit and we intend to vigorously pursue their prosecution 
we expect expenses for license and patent disputes to be significantly higher in than in due to the ongoing costs associated with both cases 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was million for  compared with million for our interest income during was  lower than interest income earned in during  for liquidity purposes in anticipation of cash needs  including new corporate complex construction costs  as well as anticipation of rising interest rates  we maintained a larger portion of our cash and marketable securities in cash and cash equivalents  which yielded lower interest income than our marketable securities 
the decrease in interest income was offset by an increase in realized gains primarily from the collection of intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies of  in provision for income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for compared with million in our annual effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a decrease in our overall state tax rate of as more of our product sales and income was apportioned to states with lower income tax rates 
years ended december  and product sales 
product sales for increased to million from million in the million increase in total product sales consisted of million of product sales growth resulting from an increase in sales volume  reduced by million resulting from a decline in average selling prices of our products 
growth in the sales volume of our triage bnp test represented of the product sales growth resulting from an increase in sales volume 
our net sales of our cardiovascular products totaled million for  compared with million for net sales of our cardiovascular products increased primarily due to growth in sales volume of our triage bnp test  which totaled approximately million 
net sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel  triage tox drug screen  triage c 
difficile panel and triage parasite panel were approximately million for  compared with million for the net sales increase of these products was primarily due to a million growth in sales volume of our triage tox drug screen  which was launched in february contract revenues 
contract revenues for were million  compared with million for contract revenues recognized during consisted primarily of research funding  antibody fees and milestone revenues 
we recognized  of research funding from the alliance with medarex during each quarter of and other contract revenues recognized during and included license fees  antibody fees  and amortization of up front technology access fees 
the decrease in contract revenues during  compared with  resulted primarily from the grant of a non exclusive license by us to a company for certain proprietary technology in no comparable license fees were recognized in costs of the research and development resources performing collaborative and internal biosite discovery activities were approximately million for  compared with approximately million for these costs are included in research and development expenses 
cost of product sales and gross profit from product sales 
gross profit from product sales increased to million in from million in the million increase in gross profits consisted of million that resulted from an increase in product sales  reduced by million resulting from changes in the gross margins of each of our products 
for and  the gross margins for our cardiovascular products were and  respectively  while our gross margins for our triage drugs of abuse panel and other products were and  respectively 
sales of our cardiovascular products represented of our product sales for  compared with for during  in response to the rapid product sales growth trend for the triage bnp test  we made significant investments to expand our production capacity through the addition of production shifts  facility improvements  and implementation of automated and semi automated equipment  in order to ensure our ability to satisfy anticipated customer demands and maintain customer satisfaction 
as a result of changes in sales expectations for the third and fourth quarters of  we scaled back our production during that time 
consequently  our increased manufacturing costs were spread over a smaller than anticipated production volume  contributing to lower gross margins in than selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million in at december   our headcount performing sales  marketing and administrative functions totaled  compared with at december  the increase in sg a expenses from to was primarily associated with the addition of sales  clinical education and technical service resources in the united states  and higher performance based compensation  such as sales commissions and bonuses based on our financial performance 
in the united states  our salaries and benefits increased million and our travel and entertainment expenses increased million 
in  we formed and began operating direct sales and distribution operations in france and germany resulting in an increase in sg a expenses of million 
additionally  our sg a expenses increased million for outside consultants  advertising and market research due to expanded selling and marketing activities related to our broader product lines  added focus on new markets such as physician offices and increased administrative needs to support our expanded operations 
research and development expenses r d expenses 
r d expenses increased to million in from million in at december   our headcount performing research and development functions totaled  compared with at december  r d employees expenses increased million  including increased performance based compensation based on our performance versus our beginning of the year goals 
expanded activity in r d resulted in an increase in supplies and other materials of million 
during and  our research and development resources were focused primarily on new product development  the development of potential improvements to our existing products and manufacturing processes  and research activities associated with biosite discovery 
expenses related to the performance of our obligations associated with earning our contract revenues were incurred by our research and development group  primarily biosite discovery 
license and patent disputes 
expenses associated with license and patent disputes incurred during totaled million 
we did not incur any such expenses during the expenses consisted primarily of legal costs related to our litigation with xoma ltd 
and its affiliates  or xoma 
in september  we announced that we resolved all outstanding disputes regarding patent and licensing issues with xoma so as to permit each the freedom to operate its business  and the related legal proceedings have been dismissed 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in resulted primarily from lower interest income from our cash equivalents and marketable securities due to an overall decline in interest rates and a lower average balance of cash and marketable securities during compared with provision for income taxes 
as a result of the pre tax income and the tax credits generated in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for our annual effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
for  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our sources of cash have included cash generated from operations  primarily from the collection of accounts receivable resulting from product sales  private and public placements of equity securities  including cash generated from the exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan  proceeds from equipment financing  cash received under collaborative development agreements  and interest income 
our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with cash used for operating activities such as the purchase and growth of inventory  expansion of our sales and marketing activities and other working capital needs  and expenditures related to equipment and leaseholds used to increase our manufacturing capacity  improve our manufacturing efficiency and expand our research and development activities 
other factors that impact our cash inflow and outflow include we have experienced gross margins of greater than in each of the last three years 
as our product sales have increased significantly since  our gross profits have increased significantly as well  providing us with an increasing source of cash to finance our expansion of our operations  and fisher  which represented of our product sales in  has historically been a timely and predictable payor of its outstanding accounts receivable 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million compared with million as of december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during was largely attributable to cash generated from operating activities  for which the sales volume growth of our triage bnp tests was the primary driver 
additionally  we generated million in cash from proceeds from the issuance of shares under our stock plans and the related tax deduction from disqualifying dispositions of the shares by employees during the increased activity related to the exercise of stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan by employees was driven by increases in the market price of our common stock 
the primary cash outflow during was cash used for the construction of our new corporate complex 
in october  we completed a two part escrow closing to purchase land for the construction of our new corporate complex 
we purchased a total of usable acres for approximately million 
through december   we have expended an additional million for the design and construction of the new corporate complex 
we expect the new complex to provide us with up to  square feet of space  to be constructed in phases as needed 
the first phase will provide us with approximately  square feet of space 
the total cost of the land and construction costs of the first phase is estimated to be approximately million 
we currently plan to finance the construction of the complex using a combination of available cash balances  cash generated from operating activities and debt financing  if necessary 
we may not be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we expect the buildings in the first phase of construction to be completed during the second and third quarters of and do not anticipate expanding our operations to the new facility prior to that time 
we expect our occupancy costs to increase primarily due to increased square footage 
should there be a downturn in our business or the markets in which we compete  we may not have a need to expand our facilities as we have planned 
as a result  we may then seek an alternative use for all or a portion of the property  or seek to sell the property  which may have a negative impact on our operating results 
we may also incur unexpected costs and expenses in connection with our move from our existing facilities to our new corporate complex  or we may experience unanticipated decreases in productivity and other losses due to inefficiencies relating to this transition  or delays in obtaining any required approvals or clearances from regulatory agencies related to the validation of the manufacturing facilities 
for instance  the scale up of manufacturing at our new corporate complex could result in lower than expected manufacturing output and higher than expected product costs 
in addition  we expect to incur some duplicate facilities expenses  such as rent  during the period in which we transfer our operations to the new corporate complex as we will transfer our operations in stages 
at december   our accounts payable increased million from december  due to increased amounts payable to contractors for costs related to the construction of the new corporate complex 
other significant uses of cash during included leasehold improvements and capital equipment of approximately million primarily for the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements to increase our manufacturing capacity and efficiency 
in  we utilized cash generated from operating activities to fund our cash needs related to the construction of the new corporate complex and our expanded operations 
cash generated from operating activities in totaled million  compared with million in a significant increase in our product sales and gross profits  resulting primarily from the increase in sales volume of our triage bnp test  was the leading contributor to our cash generated from operating activities in as we increased our product sales  we expanded our commercial operations and our working capital requirements to support the expanded business 
during  due to the significant increase in our sales of triage bnp tests compared with  we increased our manufacturing capacity and inventories by million to meet the increasing demand for our products 
additionally  we experienced an increase in accounts receivable of million at december   compared with the same date in due to the timing of our receipt of a million payment from fisher that was due on december   but received in early january  and the increase in product sales during the fourth quarter of compared with the same period of the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during compared with was largely attributable to the purchase of land for the construction of our new corporate complex of million and capital expenditures of million for leasehold improvement and manufacturing equipment to expand our manufacturing capacity to meet the increased demand for our meter based triage bnp test  and to increase our manufacturing efficiency 
these primary cash outflows were offset by cash generated by operating activities of million 
during  due to the significant increase in our sales of meter based triage bnp test compared with  we increased our manufacturing capacity and our inventories increased by million to meet the increasing demand for our products 
additionally  as product sales in the fourth quarter of increased significantly compared with the same period of  we experienced an increase in accounts receivable of million at december  compared with the same date in as a result  our cash generated from operating activities in decreased million from our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  include the remaining construction costs in the first phase of the new corporate complex  which we estimate to be approximately million payable in the second and third quarters of  support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products  including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources  expenditures for equipment and other fixed assets for use in our new corporate complex  and for manufacturing and research and development purposes  the prosecution  defense and resolution of ongoing license and patent disputes  improvements in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  new discovery and product development  and clinical studies  and the continued advancement of research and development efforts 
for  we plan to spend approximately million in cash for capital expenditures primarily for manufacturing and r d equipment  furniture  fixtures and computer equipment 
we intend to use our currently available cash and cash expected to be generated from operating activities to address our capital requirements 
we expect that the performance of our product sales and the resulting gross profits will significantly impact our cash management decisions 
if our product sales and gross margins exceed our expectations  we may choose to invest the additional cash in the above projects and activities we believe appropriate 
we have utilized  and may continue to utilize  credit arrangements with financial institutions to finance the purchase of capital equipment 
factors such as interest rates and available cash will impact our decision to continue to utilize credit arrangements as a source of cash 
as of december   we had an equipment financing line of credit with a financial institution for million  of which million was available for future borrowings 
the line of credit expires on september  we have also generated cash from the exercise of stock options 
future proceeds from exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan will depend primarily upon the behavior  expectations and needs of the stock option holders and our stock price 
we believe that our available cash  cash from operations  proceeds from the issuance of stock under our stock plans and funds from existing credit arrangements will be sufficient to satisfy our funding needs for at least the next months  except for the potential funding requirement of a portion of the construction cost of our new corporate complex 
we have used available cash balances to purchase the land for our new corporate complex and pay for the design and construction costs to date 
for the remainder of the construction costs  we plan to utilize a combination of available cash and debt financing  if necessary 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
additional capital  if needed  may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may include restrictive covenants 
our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the costs  timing and effectiveness of further expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities and resources  expansion of our manufacturing capacity and our facilities expansion needs  including the construction of our new corporate complex  competition  including products competitive with our triage bnp tests  from companies with greater financial capital and resources  the prosecution  defense and resolution of license and patent disputes  the extent to which our new products and products under development are successfully developed  gain regulatory approval and market acceptance and become and remain competitive  seasonal or unanticipated changes in customer demand  regulatory changes  uncertainties or delays  the scope  timing and results of research and development efforts  including clinical studies and regulatory actions regarding our potential products  changes in third party reimbursement policies  the ability to execute  enforce and maintain license and collaborative agreements and attain the milestones under these agreements necessary to earn contract revenues  and the costs and timing associated with business development activities  including potential licensing of technologies patented by others 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms  when needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  this table should be read in conjunction with the remainder of this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations new corporate complex construction commitments purchase obligations total purchase obligations include commitments to purchase components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products  and other recurring purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements 
we have executed agreements to license technologies that are covered by the intellectual property rights of third parties 
the financial and commercial terms of each of these agreements vary significantly  and in virtually all cases our payment obligations are not material to our business as a whole 
for the most part  the license agreements call for potential cash outflows for milestone payments and future royalties based on product sales utilizing the licensed technologies 
the milestone payments under these agreements are primarily dependent on achieving product development goals  commencement of clinical studies of a product utilizing the licensed technology or meeting commercialization objectives  or any combination thereof 
examples of milestones for which we would make payments would include initiation of clinical studies of a potential product that is covered by the licensed technologies  fda clearance to market a product that is covered by the licensed technologies  and the first sale of a product that is covered by the licensed technologies in a specific territory 
the attainment of the milestones is highly uncertain and dependent upon many contingencies 
additionally  we exercise discretion whether to continue to utilize the licensed technologies 
at any time  we may  for technical or economic reasons  decide to discontinue utilizing the licensed technologies and would incur no further financial obligations beyond those payments already made 
on december   there were no milestones  either individually or in the aggregate  under our licensing and collaborative agreements for which we believe material payments are currently required to be made  and we believe that there are approximately  in payments that are reasonably likely to be made in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily from our investments in available for sale marketable securities 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivatives instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates 
beginning with the last half of  we have significantly expanded our direct sales and distribution operations in france  germany  belgium  luxembourg  the united kingdom and italy  and we may expand into additional countries in the future 
sales and costs resulting from our direct sales and distribution operations in europe are denominated primarily in local currencies and are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
further  we purchase our triage meterplus inventory from lre and incur other operating expenses  including clinical trials  which are denominated in euros and other local currencies 
as a result  our costs will fluctuate along with the currencies and general economic conditions in the countries in which we do business  which could harm our operating results 
in prior years  we have on occasion purchased forward exchange contracts to manage this exposure to exchange rate changes 
as of december   we had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively impact our consolidated sales and earnings 
international sales and operations are also subject to a variety of other risks  including difficulty in staffing  monitoring and managing foreign operations  reduced flexibility and increased cost of staffing adjustments  longer collection cycles  greater risk of uncollectible accounts  unknown or changes in regulatory practices  including import or export license requirements  trade barriers  tariffs and tax laws  adverse tax consequences  including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries  political  social or economic conditions and changes in these foreign markets  and government spending patterns
