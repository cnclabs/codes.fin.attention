the company operations require substantial investment in fixed assets or plant 
this significant capital requirement may preclude profitability during the initial years of operation 
the strategy of the company is to grow and diversify the business by adding services and geographic areas that can leverage the existing plant  but to do so within the opportunities and constraints presented by the industry 
for many years the company focused on reducing reliance on its regulated telephone operation  which up until was the only significant business within the company 
this initial diversification was concentrated in other wireline businesses  such as the cable television and regional fiber facility businesses 
in the company made its first significant investment in the wireless sector through its former investment in the virginia rsa limited partnership 
by  revenues of the regulated telephone operation had decreased to of total revenues 
in that same year more than of the company s total revenue was generated by wireline operations  and initiatives were already underway to make wireless a more significant contributor to total revenues 
during the s significant investments were made in the cellular and pcs wireless businesses 
the va rsa cellular operation  in which the company held a interest and was the general partner  experienced rapid revenue growth and excellent margins in the late s 
the cellular operation covered only six counties  and became increasingly dependent on roaming revenues 
management believed the roaming revenues and associated margins would be unsustainable as other wireless providers increasingly offered nationally branded services with significantly reduced usage charges 
to position it to participate in the newer  more advanced  digital wireless services  in the company entered the pcs business through an affiliation with american personal communications apc  initiating service along the interstate corridor from harrisonburg  virginia to chambersburg  pennsylvania 
this territory was a very close match to the company s fiber network  thereby providing economic integration that might not be available to other wireless carriers 
in  the company entered a new affiliation arrangement with sprint  the successor to apc thereby becoming part of a nationally branded wireless service and expanded the pcs footprint further into central pennsylvania 
the growing belief that national branding was critical to our wireless operations  the expectation that roaming revenues from our analog cellular operation would not continue to grow  and the increase in the number of wireless competitors in our markets  prompted the company to exit the cellular business in order to focus on our pcs operations 
the company entered into an agreement on november   to sell its ownership interest in the virginia rsa cellular operation which was classified as a discontinued operation 
the closing occurred february  the company received million in proceeds  including million in escrow for two years and million for working capital 
the million was released from escrow in february in  the company continued its profitable growth 
the pcs operation contributed million of revenue  a million or increase compared to pcs net income of million for the year ended is a million improvement over churn was  comparable to the same period last year 
the ntc acquisition provided for growth in the fourth quarter of as well as a driver for future growth as the company continues to diversify away from its traditional wireline business

the results of ntc s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the purchase date 
on january   the company  a pcs affiliate of sprint  signed agreements with sprint that resolved disputed items and documented changes in the management and operating agreements between the two companies related to the operations of the nationwide sprint pcs network 
the agreements provide the company with the ability to better estimate the future costs of certain operating expenses and in the company s opinion improve the contract between sprint and itself 
under the agreements for the period through  the travel and reseller rates between the company and sprint were set at per minute for voice and per kilobyte for data 
without this agreement the voice travel rate for would have decreased to 
since the company is in a net receivable position related to travel with sprint  the impact on net travel and reseller revenue would have been a reduction of million had the rate been in effect in beginning in  the sprint travel and reseller rate will be changed annually to equal of sprint s retail yield from the prior year 
sprint s retail yield will be determined based on sprint s average revenue per pcs user for voice services divided by the average minutes of use per user 
sprint agreed to meet certain service level goals related to the provision of customer services

the company is entitled to a most favored nations mfn clause 
during the period through  the company will have the opportunity to adopt any addendum to the management and or service agreements that sprint signs with another pcs affiliate 
the management and services agreements were further amended in may  under the terms of the may amendment  the company has agreed to participate in all new and renewed reseller agreements signed through december  additionally  the company signed a letter of agreement to participate in all existing sprint reseller arrangements applicable to the company s service area 
in consideration for this participation  the company received a reduction in the monthly fee per subscriber paid to sprint for back office services and certain network services 
the reduction per subscriber per month is in  in and in  from the amounts agreed upon in the management agreement amendment dated january beginning in november and continuing through  the company has undergone a management reorganization 
the reorganization was in recognition of the company s growth and changes in the telecom industry 
the company shifted from an organization structure that was focused on lines of business to a plan that organizes on function 
as a result  the company has expanded the senior staff and corresponding departments to better position itself for future opportunities 
summary the company s three major lines of business are wireless  wireline and other businesses 
each of the three areas has unique issues and challenges that are critical to the understanding of the operations of the company 
the wireless business is made up of two different operations  the pcs operation and the tower business 
the wireline business is made up of traditional telephone operations  a cable tv operation  fiber network leasing  a company that resells long distance and beginning december  ntc communications which provides voice and video 
other business includes the company s internet operation  the interstate corridor travel project and the sales and service of telecommunications systems 
the pcs operation must be understood within the context of the company s relationship with sprint and its pcs affiliates 
the company operates its pcs wireless network as an affiliate of sprint 
the company receives revenues from sprint for subscribers that obtain service in the company s network coverage area and those subscribers using the company s network when they travel 
the company relies on sprint to provide timely  accurate and complete information for the company to record the appropriate revenue and expenses for the periods reflected 
the company s pcs business has operated in a net travel receivable position for several years 
the company received million in net travel revenue in  compared to million in  and million in this relationship could change due to service plan changes  subscriber travel habit changes  a rate reduction after and other changes beyond the control of the company 
through sprint  the company began receiving revenue from wholesale resellers of wireless pcs service in late these resellers pay a flat rate per minute of use for all traffic their subscribers generate on the company s network 
the company s cost to handle this traffic is the incremental cost to provide the necessary network capacity 
the company faces vigorous competition in the wireless business as numerous national carriers are aggressively marketing their services in the company s markets 
the competitive landscape could change significantly depending on the marketing initiatives of our competitors  or in the event of consolidation in the wireless industry 
the wireline business is made up of traditional telephony  cable tv  fiber network operations  the company s long distance resale business and ntc communications 
the company s primary service area for the telephone  cable tv and long distance business is shenandoah county  virginia 
the county is a rural area in northwestern virginia  with a population of approximately  inhabitants  which has increased by approximately  since while a number of new housing developments are being planned for the northern portion of shenandoah county  the potential for significant numbers of additional wireline customers in the shenandoah county operating area is limited 
ntc communications provides local and long distance voice  cable television  internet and data services on an  at times  exclusive basis to multi dwelling unit communities throughout the southeastern united states including virginia  north carolina  maryland  south carolina  georgia  florida  tennessee and mississippi 
the company s telephone subscriber count declined in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter of migration to wireless and dsl services are believed to be driving this change 
based on industry experience  the company anticipates this trend may continue for the foreseeable future  although the planned construction of new homes within shenandoah county may moderate this trend 
other revenues include internet services  both dial up and dsl high speed service 
the company has seen a decline in dial up subscriptions over the last year 
the dsl service has grown in the last year driven by customer desire for faster internet connections 
the company is facing competition for revenues it generates in the other lines of business  which will require the company to differentiate itself from other providers through its service levels and evolving technologies that are more reliable and cost effective for customers 
critical accounting policies the company relies on the use of estimates and makes assumptions that impact its financial condition and results 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical results and trends as well as the company s forecasts as to how these might change in the future 
the most critical accounting policies that materially impact the company s results of operations include allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit policies  and the analysis of the accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these estimates  the company compares historical write offs in relation to the estimated period in which the subscriber was originally billed 
the company also looks at the historical average length of time that elapses between the original billing date and the date of write off and the financial position of its larger customers in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
from this information  the company assigns specific amounts to the aging categories 
the company provides an allowance for substantially all receivables over days old 
the allowance for doubtful accounts balance as of december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
if the allowance for doubtful accounts is not adequate  it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position and results of operations 
the company also reviews current trends in the credit quality of the subscriber bases in its various businesses and periodically changes its credit policies 
as of december   the sprint pcs subscriber base in the company s market area consisted of sub prime credit quality subscribers compared to at december   a decline of 
in the fourth quarter of  the company identified several target markets where it has loosened its credit policies to evaluate the impact on increasing sales 
this policy change has generated additional activations and is being closely monitored 
this could result in additional bad debt in the future  but management believes the added revenues offset the bad debt risk 
the remainder of the company s receivables are associated with services provided on a more localized basis  where the company exercises total control in setting credit policy parameters 
historically there have been limited losses generated from the non pcs revenue streams 
prior to  the company had not faced significant write offs of inter carrier accounts  but due to the telecommunication industry down turn in  the company experienced write offs in this area of the business totaling million in  due to bankruptcy filings of several significant telecommunications companies 
in and  the inter carrier segment of the business improved and the company recovered thousand and thousand  respectively  of bad debt from the sale of certain accounts that were previously written off 
bad debt expense summary  net of recoveries for the three years ended december in thousands pcs subscribers    interexchange carriers other subscribers and entities total bad debt expense    revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered or products have been delivered  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company s revenue recognition polices are consistent with the guidance in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 as amended by sab  revenue recognition in financial statements promulgated by the securities and exchange commission  and the emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
effective july  the company adopted eitf the eitf guidance addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve multiple revenue generating activities  ie  the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
in applying this guidance  separate contracts with the same party  entered into at or near the same time  will be presumed to be a bundled transaction  and the consideration will be measured and allocated to the separate units based on their relative fair values 
the consensus guidance was applicable to new pcs service agreements entered into for quarters beginning july  the adoption of eitf required evaluation of each arrangement entered into by the company for each sales channel 
the company will continue to monitor arrangements with its sales channels to determine if any changes in revenue recognition will need to be made in the future 
the adoption of eitf has resulted in substantially all of the pcs activation fee revenue generated through company owned retail stores and associated direct costs being recognized at the time the related wireless handset is sold and it is classified as equipment revenue and cost of equipment  respectively 
upon adoption of eitf  previously deferred pcs revenue and costs will continue to be amortized over the remaining estimated life of a subscriber  not to exceed months 
pcs revenue and costs for activations at other retail locations and through other sales channels will continue to be deferred and amortized over their estimated lives as prescribed by sab the adoption of eitf in  had the effect of increasing equipment revenue by thousand and increasing costs of equipment by thousand  which otherwise would have been deferred and amortized 
the company records equipment revenue from the sale of handsets and accessories to subscribers in its retail stores and to local distributors in its territories upon delivery 
the company does not record equipment revenue on handsets and accessories purchased by subscribers in the company s territories from national third party retailers or those provided by sprint 
the company believes the equipment revenue and related cost of equipment associated with the sale of wireless handsets and accessories is a separate earnings process from the sale of wireless services to subscribers 
for competitive marketing reasons  the company usually sells wireless handsets at prices lower than the cost 
in certain instances the company may offer larger handset discounts as an incentive for the customer to agree to a multi year service contract 
the company also sells wireless handsets to existing customers at a loss and accounts for these transactions separately from agreements to provide customers wireless service 
these transactions are viewed as a cost to retain the existing customers and deter churn 
for the company s wireless customers that purchase and activate their service through a channel not covered by eitf  the wireless customers generally pay an activation fee to the company when they initiate service 
the company defers the activation fee revenue except when a special promotion reduces or waives the fee over the average life of its subscribers  which is estimated to be months 
the company recognizes service revenue from its subscribers as they use the service 
the company provides a reduction of recorded revenue for billing adjustments and a fee of that is retained by sprint 
the company also reduces recorded revenue for rebates and discounts given to subscribers on wireless handset sales at company owned retail stores in accordance with eitf issue no 
accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a subscriber including a reseller of the vendor s products 
the company participates in the sprint national and regional distribution programs in which national retailers sell sprint wireless products and services 
in order to facilitate the sale of sprint wireless products and services  national retailers purchase wireless handsets from sprint for resale and receive compensation from sprint for sprint wireless products and services sold 
for industry competitive reasons  sprint subsidizes the price of these handsets by selling the handsets at a price below cost 
under the company s agreements with sprint  when a national retailer sells a handset purchased from sprint to a subscriber in the company s territories  the company is obligated to reimburse sprint for the handset subsidy 
the company does not receive any revenues from the sale of handsets and accessories by national retailers 
the company classifies these handset subsidy charges as a cost of goods expense 
sprint retains of billed revenues from subscribers based in the company s markets and from non sprint wholesale subscribers who roam onto the company s network 
the amount of affiliation fees retained by sprint is recorded as an offset to the revenues recorded 
revenues derived from the sale of handsets and accessories by the company and from certain roaming services outbound roaming and travel revenues from sprint and its pcs affiliate subscribers are not subject to the affiliation fee from sprint 
the company defers direct subscriber activation costs on subscribers whose activation falls within the sab  as amended by sab  guidelines 
the activation costs are deferred when incurred  and then amortized using the straight line method over months  which is the estimated average life of a subscriber 
direct subscriber activation costs also include the activation charge from sprint  and credit check fees 
these fees are charged to the company by sprint at approximately per subscriber 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company evaluates the recoverability of tax assets generated on a state by state basis from net operating losses apportioned to that state 
management uses a more likely than not threshold to make that determination and has established a valuation allowance against the tax assets  in case they are not recoverable 
for  the company s valuation allowance decreased million due to the improved operating performance of the company s pcs segment 
the valuation allowance now stands at million as of december  management will evaluate the effective rate of taxes based on apportionment factors  the company s operating results  and the various state income tax rates 
currently  management anticipates the future effective income tax rate to be approximately

management continually reviews its relationship with sprint as new developments and requirements are added 
note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contains a detailed description of the significant contractual relationship 
see item business risk factors  recent developments and regulation for a discussion of risks relating to the company s pcs business  its relationship with sprint and the wireless industry in general 
the company s access revenue may be adversely impacted by legislative or regulatory actions that decrease access rates or exempt certain traffic from paying access to the company s regulated telephone network 
the federal communications commission is currently reviewing the issue of voice over internet protocol voip as it relates to access charges 
an unfavorable finding may have an adverse effect on the company s telephone operations 
see item business regulation 
there has been a trend for incumbent local exchange carriers to see a decrease in access lines due to the effect of wireless and wireline competition and the elimination of a second line dedicated to dial up internet as customers migrate to broadband connections 
although the company has not seen a material reduction in its number of access lines to date  it experienced line decreases in each of the last two quarters 
there is a significant risk that this trend could have a material adverse effect on the company s telephone operations in the future 
the company s revenue from fiber leases may be adversely impacted by further erosion in demand or in price competition for these facilities 
the company monitors each of its fiber lease customers closely to minimize the risk related to this business 
the company operates the cable television system in shenandoah county  virginia 
the company has seen increased competition from satellite providers that are larger and have cost advantages over the company in the procurement of programming 
the continued success of the satellite television providers may have an adverse impact on the company s cable television results

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures management  with the participation of the president and chief executive officer  who is the principal executive officer  and the executive vice president and chief financial officer  who is the principal financial officer  conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures  as defined by rule a e under the securities exchange act of based on this evaluation  the company s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december  during  there were changes in the company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected  or are reasonably likely to materially affect  its internal control over financial reporting as follows the company dedicated significant resources during the second quarter of in preparing for the conversion of its new pcs point of sale system 
the conversion involved a change from a stand alone  company hosted system  to a system hosted and integrated into the sprint pcs billing system 
through this integration  the company eliminated several points of multiple data entry  thereby reducing the risk of error  and enhancing internal control  while improving the sales process 
the new system was placed in service during mid july the company has put into place processes that have steadily improved our ability to identify material errors in sprint financial information on a timely basis 
these processes are in part a result of a new amended management and services agreement in connection with the requirements imposed under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we retained an outside consulting firm to assist us in reviewing  documenting  and improving our internal control processes and have engaged goodman and company  a regional accounting firm to assist in the testing of these controls 
on an ongoing basis  the company contracted with goodman and company to perform internal audit functions 
under our agreements with sprint  sprint provides us with billing  collections  customer care  certain network operations and other back office services for the pcs operation 
as a result  sprint remits to the company approximately of the company s total revenues  while approximately of the expenses reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements relate to charges by or through sprint for expenses such as billing  collections and customer care  roaming expense  long distance  and travel 
due to this relationship  the company necessarily relies on sprint to provide accurate  timely and sufficient data and information to properly record our revenues  expenses and accounts receivable  which underlie a substantial portion of our periodic financial statements and other financial disclosures 
information provided by sprint includes reports regarding the subscriber accounts receivable in our markets 
sprint provides us monthly accounts receivable  billing and cash receipts information on a market level  rather than a subscriber level 
we review these various reports to identify discrepancies or errors 
however  under our agreements with sprint  we are entitled to only a portion of the receipts  net of items such as taxes  government surcharges  certain allocable write offs and the of revenue retained by sprint 
because of our reliance on sprint for financial information  we must depend on sprint to design adequate internal controls with respect to the processes established to provide this data and information to the company and sprint s other pcs affiliate network partners 
to address this issue  sprint engages independent auditors to perform a periodic evaluation of these controls and to provide a report on controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness for affiliates under guidance provided in statement of auditing standards no 
sas reports 
the report is provided to the company on semi annual basis and covers a twelve month period 
the current recent report covers the period from october  to september  the most recent report indicated there were no material issues  that were not remediated by year end  which would adversely affect the information used to support the recording of the revenues and expenses provided by sprint related to the company s relationship with them 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates on instruments held for other than trading purposes 
our interest rate risk involves three components 
the first component is outstanding debt with variable rates 
as of december   the company s variable rate debt balance was million 
the company s interest rate risk on the variable rate debt is thousand for a increase in the interest rate 
the company s remaining debt has fixed rates through its maturity 
a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the total debt by approximately million  while the estimated current fair value of the fixed rate debt is approximately million 
the second component of interest rate risk is temporary excess cash  primarily invested in overnight repurchase agreements and treasury bills with a maturity of less than days 
the company currently has approximately million of cash equivalents in treasury bills  which are earning rates of approximately per year 
the cash is currently in short term investment vehicles that have limited interest rate risk 
management continues to evaluate the most beneficial use of these funds 
the third component of interest rate risk is marked increases in interest rates which may adversely impact the rate at which the company may borrow funds for growth in the future 
although this risk is real  it is not significant at this time as the company has adequate cash for operations  payment of debt and near term capital projects 
management does not view market risk as having a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although future results could be adversely impacted if interest rates were to escalate markedly and the company required external financing 
since the company does not currently have significant investments in publicly traded stock  currently there is limited risk related to the company s available for sale securities 
general economic conditions impacted by regulatory changes  competition or other external influences may play a higher risk to the company s overall results 
as of december   the company has million invested in privately held companies directly or through investments with portfolio managers 
most of the companies are early stage and significant increases in interest rates could have an adverse impact on their results  ability to raise capital and viability 
the company s market risk is limited to the funds previously invested and an additional million committed under contracts the company has signed with portfolio managers
