item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company operating in california and the rocky mountain and mid continent regions 
the company s objective is to increase shareholder value by profitably growing reserves and production  primarily through drilling operations and strategic acquisitions 
the company seeks high quality development  exploitation and exploration projects with potential for providing long term drilling inventories that generate high returns 
approximately three quarters of the company s revenues are generated through the sale of oil and natural gas production under either negotiated contracts or spot gas purchase contracts at market prices 
over of these volumes are from oil production  and the majority of those volumes are from heavy oil production in california 
the other quarter of the company s revenues are derived from electricity sales from cogeneration facilities which supply over half of the company s steam requirement for use in its california thermal heavy oil operations 
the company has invested in these facilities for the purpose of lowering its steam costs which are significant in the production of heavy crude oil 
the company s revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on its ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect its reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas operations 
oil and gas prices 
prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely 
oil and gas prices affect the profitability of the company  the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures  the company s ability to borrow and raise additional capital  and the amount of oil and gas that the company can economically produce 
approximately of the company s current production is california heavy crude oil which sells at a discount to wti crude pricing 
the risk of widening price differentials between wti and the company s california heavy crude oil is mitigated by a crude oil sales contract under which the company sells over of its california production 
pricing in the existing agreement is based upon the higher of the average of the local field posted prices plus a fixed premium  or wti minus a fixed differential approximating per barrel 
this contract expires on december  while crude oil price differentials between wti and california s heavy crude were fairly consistent in both and at just under per barrel  the differential widened dramatically during  with the average climbing to 
on december  the differential ended the year at 
this differential has averaged over per barrel in the first two months of  and the company is monitoring this differential and trying to determine the reasons behind the breakout from the historical norm 
subsequent to the termination of the current contract  a widening differential between wti and california crude oil could adversely affect the company s revenues  profitability and cash flows from its heavy oil operations 
the company will enter into a new contract if favorable terms can be achieved or may sell its crude oil into the spot market 
the company s cogeneration plants and conventional steam boilers require significant volumes of natural gas for use as fuel in generating steam used in the production of its heavy oil 
a substantial increase in california natural gas prices without a corresponding increase in heavy crude oil prices would adversely affect the company s california heavy oil operations 
this risk is partially offset by the company s cogeneration plants  as their revenue is currently linked to the price of california natural gas available for purchase at california s border 
a change in these electricity contracts to a formula that is not closely linked to the price of california natural gas would increase the company s risk related to an increase in california natural gas prices 
at times  california natural gas prices have been more volatile than other markets in the united states 
to mitigate the risk of volatile california natural gas prices  the company has a firm transportation contract with kern river gas transmission company for  mmbtu d  approximately one third of the company s current natural gas demand  until april there is a proceeding currently before the federal energy regulatory commission ferc that may result in an upward adjustment in the transportation charge under this contract 
the company does not believe any such adjustment would have a material adverse impact on its operations 
the company generally hedges a substantial  but varying  portion of its anticipated future oil production and natural gas used as fuel in its enhanced oil recovery operations 
the company uses hedging to  among other things  reduce its exposure to commodity price fluctuations 

table of contents reserve replacement 
generally  the company s producing properties in california have a modest initial production rate with a gradual production decline and long reserve life 
the company s rocky mountain assets have high initial production rates  followed by steeper declines and a shorter reserve life 
the company s niobrara natural gas assets have modest initial production rates  a gradual decline and long reserve life 
the company attempts to locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to grow the company and replace those reserves being depleted by production 
substantial capital expenditures are required to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
significant estimates 
the company believes the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates it must make in connection with the preparation of its financial statements are determining its proved oil and gas reserves  timing of its future drilling  development and abandonment activities  future costs to develop and abandon oil and gas properties  estimates and timing of certain tax items  deductions and credits  estimates related to certain  if any  environmental impacts of operations  and the valuation of derivative positions 
please see other factors affecting the company s business and financial results in this item for a more detailed discussion of a number of other factors that affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion provides information on the results of operations for each of the three years ended december   and and the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december  and the financial statements and the notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
the profitability of the company s operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to the average realized prices of oil  gas and electricity sold  the type and volume of oil and gas produced and electricity generated and the results of development  exploitation  acquisition and exploration activities 
the average realized prices for natural gas and electricity will fluctuate from one period to another due to regional market conditions and other factors  while oil prices will be predominantly influenced by world supply and demand 
the aggregate amount of oil and gas produced may fluctuate based on the success of development and exploitation of oil and gas reserves pursuant to current reservoir management 
the cost of natural gas used in the company s steaming operations and electrical generation  production rates  labor  maintenance expenses and production taxes are expected to be the principal influences on operating costs 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company may fluctuate from period to period based on the foregoing principal factors  among others 
results of operations in  the company achieved a record year for revenue and net income 
the company earned million  or per share diluted  in on revenues of million  up from million  or per share diluted  on revenues of million in  and up from million  or per share diluted  on revenues of million earned in

the company s revenues are derived from the sale of its oil and gas production and electricity generation 
the company s revenues may vary significantly from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and or production volumes 
sales of oil and gas were million in  up from million in and up from million in this significant improvement was due to increases in both oil prices and production levels 
the increase in oil prices contributed roughly two thirds of the revenue increase and the increase in production volumes contributed the other third 
the average sales price per boe of the company s oil and gas  net of hedging  was  up and from and received in and  respectively 
approximately of the company s oil and gas sales volumes in were crude oil  with of the crude oil being heavy oil produced in california which is sold under a contract based on the higher of wti minus a fixed differential or the average posted price of three local posters plus a premium 
this contract expires on december  with this contract in place  the company has effectively eliminated the risk of a differential larger than approximately per barrel between the company s heavy crude oil and wti prices through december  the average differential widened during to and was over for the first two months of in  the company estimates that its revenues benefited from this contract by approximately million  and at a current differential of approximately per barrel  the company estimates that its revenues in will benefit from the contract by approximately million 
the company is monitoring the differential and investigating the possible reasons as to why this differential has expanded over its historical average 
while the company believes that over time the differential will be more in line with its historical norm  it is unlikely that the company will be able to obtain terms similar for crude oil sales in to the current contract 
the company is confident that it will be able to secure a contract for the sale of its california heavy crude oil if it so desires 
the brundage canyon crude oil is priced at wti less a fixed differential approximating per barrel 
during  wti prices per barrel reached a high of  a low of and averaged for the year compared to an average of and in and  respectively 
in  the difference between wti and the company s average sales price  net of hedging  consists of product quality differentials of per boe  hedge payments of per boe  and price sensitive royalties of per boe 
the company anticipates crude oil prices to remain strong in and into however  since crude oil prices are impacted by world supply and demand  instability in the middle east and other factors  actual prices may vary significantly from current prices 
as a result of hedging activities  the company s revenue was reduced by million  million and million in  and  respectively  which was reported as a reduction in sales of oil and gas in the company s financial statements 
these price hedging activities resulted in a net reduction in revenue per boe to the company of in  in  and 
in the company has hedged approximately  barrels per day of its oil production for at prices averaging near wti per barrel 
the company primarily is at risk to reductions in operating income as a result of declines in crude oil and electricity prices and increases in natural gas prices 
the company s exposure to increasing natural gas prices will be less in than due to the additional gas production from the niobrara field and potential increases in natural gas production in the uinta basin 
the company s sales volume from natural gas is expected to approximately double from its sales volume 
to assist in mitigating these risks  the company periodically enters into various types of commodity hedges

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
table of contents acquisitions 
in august  the company completed the acquisition of its brundage canyon properties for approximately million 
the properties represented berry s first substantial acquisition of a company operated core asset outside of california  and was consistent with the company s goal of building a strong asset portfolio in the rocky mountain region 
at acquisition  the properties produced less than  boe day of light crude oil and natural gas 
in and  the company drilled new wells and completed a number of workovers  increasing production to approximately  boe day at december  the company believes the rockies provide the company with solid upside potential and is committed to increasing its acreage position in this region 
in september  the company entered into a farm out agreement pursuant to which bill barrett corporation had the right to earn a working interest in the deep mesaverde formation and deeper horizons within the brundage canyon field by drilling a deep exploratory test 
the company s partner commenced the drilling of its initial deep exploratory well in brundage canyon in november and abandoned it in january  pending further evaluation of a d seismic survey and assessment of optimal completion technology 
no costs were incurred by the company related to the drilling or abandonment of this well 
as part of the company s expansion into the rockies  in july  the company and bill barrett corporation completed a joint exploration and development agreement with the ute indian tribe to explore for and develop potential hydrocarbons on  gross  net prospective acres of tribal lands in the uinta basin in utah 
the company also purchased an interest in  gross  net acres of fee lands near and or adjacent to the tribal acreage 
the total  gross acre block is located immediately west of the company s brundage canyon producing properties 
the total cost to the company was approximately million 
the company will drill and operate the shallow wells which target light oil in the green river formation and retain up to a working interest 
the company s partner will drill and operate the deep wells which target natural gas in the mesaverde and wasatch formations 
berry will hold up to a working interest in these deep wells the ute tribe has the option to participate in each well and obtain a working interest which would reduce the company s and its partner s participation 
the company is committed to drill two shallow test wells in the green river trend and participate in one deep test well in the mesaverde formation in the company s minimum obligation under its exploration and development agreement is million 
the company plans to commence drilling in the summer of in december  the company entered into a development agreement with petro canada resources usa inc to develop their coyote flats prospect in the uinta basin 
the property is located approximately miles southwest of the company s brundage canyon property 
the company is obligated to drill three test wells into the ferron sand to a depth of approximately  feet and also drill a six well emery coalbed methane pilot  at approximately  feet 
upon the completion of this total nine well drilling program  the company will earn an interest in the approximately  gross acres  net 
the company has drilled one ferron sand test well in early which was deemed to be a dry hole 
the company plans to drill the remaining two ferron sand test wells and the emery coalbed methane pilot wells during the company estimates that its total cost under this agreement will be approximately million  which consists of million paid at signing and approximately million for the drilling of the obligation wells 
future development plans will be determined jointly by the company and its partner  petro canada resources 
in january  the company acquired certain interests in the niobrara fields in northeastern colorado for approximately million 
the properties consist of approximately  gross  net acres 
current production is approximately mmcf of natural gas per day  with estimated proved reserves of bcf 
the acquisition also includes approximately miles of a pipeline gathering system and gas compression facilities for delivery into interstate gas lines 
in  the company plans to drill approximately gross wells as part of the development of this asset 
in january  the company acquired a working interest in approximately  gross  net prospective acres  located in eastern colorado  western kansas and southwestern nebraska  from bill barrett corporation 
the company and its partner will jointly explore and develop shallow niobrara biogenic natural gas  sharon springs shale gas and deeper pennsylvanian formation oil assets on the acreage 
the company paid approximately million for its working interest in the acreage 
the company believes the potential of the tri state area can be exploited by using new drilling techniques  with d seismic technology to assess structural complexity  and estimate potentially recoverable oil and gas and determine drilling locations 
the company anticipates drilling eight gross wells with its partner in to test the niobrara gas potential 
royalty conversion 
in december certain royalty owners exercised their right to convert their royalty interest into a working interest on the company s formax property in the midway sunset field 
this resulted in a reduction to the company of million barrels of reserves and represents approximately boe day at year end production levels 
the company has no other similar conversion rights by any other current royalty owners 
oil and gas production 
the company s oil and gas production reached record levels in  averaging  boe day  up from its level of  boe day  the previous record for the company and up from  boe day in this significant increase was due primarily to the success of the company s continued development of its brundage canyon properties in utah  acquired in august with the drilling of new wells in and additional wells in 
table of contents  these properties contributed  boe day for all of with the continued development of its california and brundage canyon properties and the initial development of it newly acquired assets in the rocky mountain and mid continent region  the company anticipates that oil and gas production will average in excess of  boe day in or an approximate increase in production over electricity generation 
the company produced  mwh d of electricity in  compared to  mwh d in and  mwh d produced in during  the company received an average sales price  before hedging  for its electricity per mwh of compared to in and in during  electricity prices were  relative to the cost of natural gas to generate electricity  improved from in january  three standard offer contracts were extended on similar terms to those in effect for this volume represented approximately of the company s electricity sales output 
under the terms of the standard offer contracts  the price received for the electricity is based on the cost of natural gas at the california border 
the company consumes approximately  mmbtu of natural gas per day for use in generating steam and of this total  approximately is consumed in the company s cogeneration operations 
by maintaining a correlation between electricity and natural gas prices  the company is able to better control its cost of producing steam 
depending on the outcome of a proceeding that is currently under way at the cpuc to review and revise the methodology to determine srac energy prices  this correlation between electricity and natural gas prices may change at some point in the future 
three of the so contracts expired on december  however  by order of the cpuc in january  the respective utilities were ordered to continue to offer so contracts for an additional term of five years to certain qfs  such as the company 
in december  the company executed a five year contract with edison for the placerita unit facility  and five year contracts with pg e for the cogen and cogen facilities  each effective january  edison and pg e have challenged  in the california court of appeal  the legality of the cpuc decision that ordered the utilities to enter into the one year so contracts for  and the decision that ordered the utilities to enter five year so contracts 
arguments in this case were heard by the court in march based on the current pricing mechanism for its electricity under the contracts  the company expects that its electricity revenues will be in the to million range for and that these operations will be marginally profitable before any dd a charges 
in  the company recorded income of million  which represented the recovery of a portion of the million of the receivables from electricity sales that were written off in due to non payment by utilities contractually obligated to purchase the company s electricity 
oil and gas operating expenses 
the company believes that the most informative way to analyze changes in recurring operating expenses from one period to another is on a per unit of production  or boe  basis 
the company revised its allocation of cogeneration costs to oil and gas operations during operating costs information has been revised to reflect this allocation which is based on the conversion efficiency of fuel to electricity and steam of the company s cogeneration plants 
the following table presents information about the company s operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended december  amount per boe amount in thousands change change operating costs dd a g a interest expense total 
table of contents the company s total operating expenses for  stated on a unit of production basis  increased over the increase was primarily related to the following items operating costs for  on a per barrel basis  increased over the cost of the company s steaming operations for its heavy oil properties represents a significant portion of the company s operating costs and will vary depending on both the cost of natural gas used as fuel and the volume of steam injected during the year 
steam costs were higher in as the cost for natural gas per mmbtu increased to from in  an increase of 
the company also injected an average of  bspd in  up from  bspd in assuming stable crude oil and natural gas prices  the company plans to inject steam at levels in comparable to levels and anticipates operating costs in  on a per boe basis  to average between and in its california operations  between and in its utah operations and between and for the total company 
dd a was per boe in  up from per boe in dd a in was higher due to the shorter reserve life of the brundage canyon properties in utah and the cumulative effect of increased development activities in recent years 
the company expects dd a to trend higher over the next few years due to the shorter reserve life of the rocky mountain assets compared to the company s california properties and continued development of its california and rocky mountain properties 
the company anticipates its oil and gas dd a charges for will range from to per boe 
g a expenses in were per boe  up from per boe in stock based compensation costs increased by million in  which are primarily non cash charges resulting from mark to market adjustments under the variable method of accounting prior to the change of certain exercise provisions of the company s stock option plan on july  and non cash compensation expense under the fair value method of accounting 
compensation expenses increased by million due to increased staffing resulting from the company s growth  an increase in compensation levels and bonuses and costs related to a change in chief executive officers 
additionally  the company incurred increased legal and accounting fees during of approximately million  primarily due to compliance with sarbanes oxley and other financial reporting related matters

per boe  up from 
per boe in the company s borrowings at year end were million  up from million in due to the acquisition of its brundage canyon properties in august electricity operating costs 
the company allocates cogeneration costs between electricity generation and oil and gas operations based on the conversion efficiency of fuel to electricity and steam of each cogeneration facility and certain direct costs to produce steam 
as a result of this allocation  cogeneration costs allocated to electricity will vary based on  among other factors  the thermal efficiency of the company s cogeneration plants  the price of natural gas used for fuel in generating electricity and steam  and the terms of the company s power contracts 
the company s investment in its cogeneration facilities has been for the express purpose of lowering the steam costs in its heavy oil operations and securing operating control of the respective steam generation 
as such  the company views any profit or loss from the generation of electricity as a decrease or increase  respectively  to its total cost of producing its heavy oil in california 
the gross profit sales of electricity less electricity operating costs for the years ended december   and was million  million and 
million  respectively 
on a per barrel basis  the company views this gross profit as a decrease of  
and 
to the company s total oil and gas operating expenses 
dd a related to the company s cogeneration facilities is allocated between electricity operations and oil and gas operations using a similar allocation method 
income taxes 
the company experienced an effective tax rate of in  up from and reported in and  respectively 
the increase in effective tax rate during is primarily due to a much higher over increase pre tax income in over the company s expansion outside of california and investment in non thermal projects are also key factors in the increase 
the company is able to achieve an effective tax rate below the statutory tax rate of approximately primarily as a result of significant eor tax credits earned by the company s continued investment in the development of its thermal eor projects  both through capital expenditures and continued steam injection the company believes it will continue to earn significant eor tax credits 
the company expects its effective tax rate will trend higher as it diversifies its activities outside california and expects to have an effective tax rate in the to range in  based on wti prices averaging between and coalbed methane prospect 
during and early  the company leased a total of approximately  net acres in kansas and  net acres in illinois to explore for economic concentrations of coalbed methane at a total lease cost of approximately million 
a five well pilot was drilled in the wabaunsee county portion of the kansas acreage in the fourth quarter of after testing  the company concluded that this pilot would not produce commercial quantities of natural gas and  therefore  wrote off the cost to drill these wells and the associated acreage in for a pre tax charge to operations of million 
in august  the company completed the sale of approximately  leased net acres in jackson county  kansas for approximately million  while retaining an overriding royalty interest in the property 
the company recovered its cost associated with this acreage 
the company also drilled a second five well pilot in jasper county  illinois in the fourth quarter of after testing it was determined that gas volumes were not likely to be sufficient to realize commercial production  therefore  the costs to drill these wells and an impairment of the acreage was recorded in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
in  the company will evaluate if it is advantageous to retain the properties  but currently has no capital allocated for further testing of these properties 

table of contents dry hole  abandonment and impairment 
at december   the company was in the process of drilling one exploratory well on its midway sunset property and one exploratory well on its coyote flats prospect 
these two wells were determined non commercial in february costs of 
million which were incurred as of december  were charged to expense and are reflected on the company s income statement under dry hole  abandonment and impairment 
remaining costs related to these wells are approximately million which will be charged to expense during the first quarter of during  the company recorded a pre tax write down of million related to two cbm pilot projects 
for the periods ended december  and december   the fair value of the company s oil and gas properties exceeded their carrying cost and as a result  the company did not write down any of its oil and gas properties 
other 
in  the company recorded income of million  which represented the recovery of receivables from electricity sales that were written off in due to non payment by utilities contractually obligated to purchase the company s electricity 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves 
the company achieves reserve replacement and growth primarily through successful development and exploration drilling and the acquisition of properties 
fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for short term changes in the company s cash flow from operating activities 
the net long term growth in the company s cash flow from operating activities is the result of growth in production as affected by period to period fluctuations in commodity prices 
the company establishes a capital budget for each calendar year based on its development opportunities and the expected cash flow from operations for that year 
the company may revise its capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions and or drilling outcomes 
excess cash generated from operations is normally applied to debt reduction during the year 
working capital and cash flows 
the company s working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under its credit arrangements 
generally  the company uses excess cash to pay down borrowings under its credit arrangement 
as a result  the company often has a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital 
working capital as of december  was negative million  up from a negative million at december  cash flow from operations is dependent upon the company s ability to increase production through development  exploration and acquisition activities and the price of natural gas and oil 
the company s cash flow from operations also is impacted by changes in working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million  up from million in and up from million in the increase in was a direct result of the increases in crude oil prices and production levels in compared to and sales of oil and gas increased million in compared to  with crude oil prices  net of hedges  increasing and production increasing in compared to cash flow was impacted by a increase  or million  in accounts payable and revenue and royalties payable due to increased capital expenditures in  the continued development of both the california and utah assets and due to a million increase in a price sensitive royalty on one of the company s california properties 
cash flow was also impacted by a increase  or million  in accounts receivable due to the increases in oil prices and production volumes and a full year of production at brundage canyon 
the company s net decrease in borrowings on its credit line was million in cash was used for capital expenditures of million  to fund million in property acquisitions and to pay dividends of million 
capital expenditures 
total capital expenditures in  excluding acquisitions  were million and included the drilling of new wells and completing workovers on its california properties and the drilling of new wells and completion of workovers on its brundage canyon properties in utah 
assuming stable oil and gas prices  excluding any future acquisitions in  the company plans to spend at least million on capital projects including million to drill new wells and perform workovers in california and million to drill new wells and perform workovers in the rocky mountain and mid continent regions from internally generated cash flow 
with this increased development  the company anticipates that production will average in excess of  boe day in  up over from an average  boe per day in credit facility 
the company successfully completed a new million unsecured three year credit facility in july the facility replaced the previous million unsecured facility which was due to mature in january the facility recognizes the company s strong financial position and provides significant low cost capital for the company to meet its growth objectives 
in august  the company drew upon this facility to finance the million purchase of the 
table of contents brundage canyon  utah assets 
as of december   the company had million available under the facility 
the company drew on its credit facility to fund its acquisition of certain assets in the niobrara field in january as of march   the company s borrowing under its credit facility totaled million 
exclusive of any further acquisitions in  the company plans to reduce debt levels from excess cash generated from operating activities 
the facility is a revolving credit facility for up to million with ten banks 
at december  and  the company had million and million  respectively  outstanding under the facility 
in addition to the million in borrowings under the agreement  the company has 
million of outstanding letters of credit and the remaining credit available under the facility is therefore  million at december  the maximum amount available is subject to an annual borrowing base redetermination in accordance with the lenders customary procedures and practices 
the facility matures on july  interest on amounts borrowed is charged at libor plus a margin of to  or the higher of the lead bank s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points plus a margin of to  with margins on the various rate options based on the ratio of credit outstanding to the borrowing base 
the company pays a commitment fee of to basis points on the unused portion  which is also based on the ratio of credit outstanding to the borrowing base 
given that the credit markets have improved over the last year and the company believes that its borrowing capacity has expanded  the company intends to negotiate a new credit facility in the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at december  was 
the facility contains restrictive covenants which  among other things  require the company to maintain a certain tangible net worth and minimum ebitda  as defined 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants as of december  at year end  the company had no subsidiaries  no special purpose entities and no off balance sheet debt 
the company did not enter into any significant related party transactions in contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt abandonment obligations operating lease obligations drilling obligation firm natural gas transportation contract total oil and gas hedging 
from time to time  the company enters into crude oil and natural gas hedge contracts  the terms of which depend on various factors  including management s view of future crude oil prices and the company s future financial commitments 
this hedging program is designed to moderate the effects of a severe price downturn while allowing berry to participate in the upside 
currently  the hedges are in the form of swaps  however  the company may use a variety of hedge instruments in the future 
these hedging activities resulted in a net reduction in revenue per boe to the company of in  in and 
in while the use of these hedging arrangements reduces the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
in addition  the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk 
the company s oil hedges are based on reported settlement prices on the nymex 
the basis risk between nymex and the company s california heavy crude oil is mitigated by the company s crude oil sales contract under which the company sells over of its california production 
pricing in the existing agreement is based upon the higher of the average of the local field posted prices plus a fixed premium  or wti minus a fixed differential approximating per barrel 
this contract expires on december  the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
with respect to the company s hedging activities  the company utilizes multiple counterparties on its hedges and monitors each counterparty s credit rating 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those amounts 
a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires management to make difficult subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical policies 
successful efforts method of accounting 
the company accounts for its oil and gas exploration and development costs using the successful efforts method 
geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred 
exploratory well costs are capitalized pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found 
if economically recoverable reserves are not found  exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes 
all exploratory wells are evaluated for economic viability within one year of well completion 
exploratory wells that discover potentially economic reserves that are in areas where a major capital expenditure would be required before production could begin  and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory work in the area  remain capitalized as long as the additional exploratory work is under way or firmly planned 
oil and gas reserves 
oil and gas reserves include proved reserves that represent estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the company s oil and gas reserves are based on estimates prepared by independent engineering consultants 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that requires judgment in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
projected future production rates  the timing of future capital expenditures as well as changes in commodity prices may significantly impact estimated reserve quantities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense and impairment of proved properties are impacted by the company s estimation of proved reserves 
these estimates are subject to change as additional information and technologies become available 
accordingly  oil and natural gas quantities ultimately recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different than projected 
reduction in reserve estimates may result in increased dd a expense  increased impairment of proved properties and a lower standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
carrying value of long lived assets 
downward revisions in the company s estimated reserve quantities  increases in future cost estimates or depressed crude oil or natural gas prices could cause the company to reduce the carrying amounts on its properties 
the company performs an impairment analysis of its proved properties annually by comparing the future undiscounted net revenue per the annual reserve valuation prepared by the company s independent reserve engineers to the net book carrying value of the assets 
an analysis of the proved properties will also be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable from future net revenue 
assets are grouped at the field level and if it is determined that the net book carrying value cannot be recovered by the estimated future undiscounted cash flow  they are written down to fair value 
for its unproved properties  the company performs an impairment analysis annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s net book carrying value may not be recoverable 
cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based on management s estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves  future crude oil and natural gas prices and costs to extract these reserves 
derivatives and hedging 
the company follows the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires the accounting recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
derivative instruments that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through net income 
under the provisions of sfas  the company may designate a derivative instrument as hedging the exposure to change in fair value of an asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk a fair value hedge or as hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk a cash flow hedge 
both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis  a fair value hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk during the periods that a hedge is designated 
similarly  a cash flow hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge 
the expectation of hedge effectiveness must be supported by matching the essential terms of the hedged asset  liability or forecasted transaction to the derivative contract or by effectiveness assessments using statistical measurements 
the company s policy is to assess hedge effectiveness at the end of each calendar quarter 

table of contents income taxes 
the company computes income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability approach which results in the recognition of deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the company s financial statements 
this difference will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not 
additionally  the company s federal and state income tax returns are generally not filed before the financial statements are prepared  therefore the company estimates the tax basis of its assets and liabilities at the end of each calendar year as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits  and tax credit carryforwards 
adjustments related to differences between the estimates used and actual amounts reported are recorded in the period in which income tax returns are filed 
these adjustments and changes in estimates of asset recovery could have an impact on results of operations 
the company generates enhanced oil recovery tax credits from the production of its heavy crude oil in california which results in a deferred tax asset 
the company believes that these credits will be fully utilized in future years and consequently has not recorded any valuation allowance related to these credits 
due to uncertainties involved with tax matters  the future effective tax rate may vary significantly from the estimated current year effective tax rate 
asset retirement obligations 
the company has significant obligations to plug and abandon oil and natural gas wells and related equipment at the end of oil and gas production operations 
the computation of the company s asset retirement obligations aro was prepared in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires the company to record the fair value of liabilities for retirement obligations of long lived assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
in resulted in an immaterial difference in the liability that had been previously recorded by the company 
estimating the future aro requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing  current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  as well as what constitutes adequate remediation 
the company obtained estimates from third parties and used the present value of estimated cash flows related to its aro to determine the fair value 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated aro 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment will be made to the related asset 
due to the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long life of the company s assets  the costs to ultimately retire the company s wells may vary significantly from previous estimates 
environmental remediation liability 
the company reviews  on a quarterly basis  its estimates of costs of the cleanup of various sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a minimum cost or a reasonable estimate of the cost of remediation can be determined  the applicable amount is accrued 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is an estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisers  the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators or courts of law  the experience of the company and other companies in dealing with similar matters and the decision of management on how it intends to respond to a particular matter 
a change in estimate could impact the company s oil and gas operating costs and the liability  if applicable  recorded on the company s balance sheet 
recent accounting developments in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  share based payments  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes apb and amends statement of accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r will require all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized based on their fair values 
sfas r must be adopted by the company no later than the third quarter of the company voluntarily adopted sfas as of january  and does not expect sfas r will have a material impact on the company s financial position  net income or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  for the tax deduction provided to us based manufacturers by the american jobs creation act of  this position clarifies how to apply sfas no 
to the new law s tax deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities 
the company does not expect this statement will have a material impact on the company s financial position  net income or cash flows 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
this statement  which addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets  is effective prospectively for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to impact the company s financial position  net income  or cash flows 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the company has not been significant in recent years because of the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states 
other factors affecting the company s business and financial results oil and gas prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
the company s revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on reasonable prices for oil and gas 
these prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and the ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount the company can borrow under its credit facility is subject to periodic asset redeterminations based in part on changing expectations of future crude oil and natural gas prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that can be economically produced 
among the factors that can cause fluctuations are the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price and availability of alternative fuels  weather conditions  the level of consumer demand  the price of foreign imports  world wide economic conditions  political conditions in oil and gas producing regions  the change in the value of the us dollar as global oil prices are priced in u 
s 
dollars  and domestic and foreign governmental regulations 
the company s heavy crude in california is less economic than lighter crude oil and natural gas 
as of december   approximately of the company s proved reserves  or million barrels  consisted of heavy oil 
heavy oil sells for less than light sweet crudes  over the past ten years  approximately per barrel less 
however  this differential widened during  averaging and has averaged over during the first two months of additionally  most of the company s heavy oil production requires heat  in the form of steam  to mobilize the oil for production from the wellbore 
steam costs represent a significant portion of the company s operating costs and are costs that the production of light crude oil or natural gas do not have 
this thermal enhanced process and the related costs further reduce the company s margins on its heavy crude oil 
the company consumes natural gas to generate steam and thus is at risk when natural gas prices rise without a corresponding rise in crude oil prices 
a widening of commodity differentials may adversely impact the company s revenues and per barrel economics 
both the company s produced crude oil and natural gas is subject to pricing in the local markets where the production occurs 
it is customary that such product is priced based on local or regional supply and demand factors 
california heavy crude sells at a substantial discount to wti  the us benchmark crude oil  primarily due to the additional cost to refine more gasoline or light product out of a barrel of heavy crude 
the company s utah light crude also is normally priced below wti 
natural gas field prices are normally priced off of nymex traded prices or henry hub  the benchmark for us natural gas 
while the company attempts to contract for the best possible price in each of its producing locations  there is no assurance that past price differentials will continue into the future 
numerous factors may influence local pricing  such as refinery capacity  pipeline capacity and specifications  upsets in the mid stream or downstream sectors of the business  trade restrictions  governmental regulations  etc 
the company may be adversely impacted by a widening differential on the products it sells 
the future of the electricity market in california is uncertain 
the company utilizes cogeneration plants in california to generate lower cost steam compared to conventional steam generation methods 
electricity produced by the company s cogeneration plants is sold to utilities and the steam costs are allocated to the company s oil and gas operations 
while the company has new five year electricity sales contracts in place with the utilities beginning on january   legal and regulatory decisions  especially related to the pricing of electricity under the contracts  can adversely affect the economics of the company s cogeneration facilities and thereby  the cost of steam for use in the company s oil and gas operations 
in addition  the utilities are seeking to overturn the cpuc order to offer such contracts 

table of contents the company may be subject to the risk of adding additional steam generation equipment if the electrical market deteriorates significantly 
the company may be subject to the risk of adding additional steam generation equipment if the electrical market deteriorates significantly 
the company is dependent on several cogeneration facilities that provide over half of its steam requirement 
these facilities are dependent on reasonable electrical contracts to provide economic steam for use in the company s operations 
if  for any reason  the company was unable to enter into an electrical contract or were to lose an existing contract  the company may not be able to supply of the steam requirements necessary to maximize production from its heavy oil assets 
an additional investment in various steam sources may be necessary to replace such steam 
the financial cost and timing of such investment may adversely affect the company s production and cash provide by operating activities 
a shortage of natural gas in california could adversely affect the company s business 
the company may be subject to the risks associated with a shortage of natural gas and or the transportation of natural gas into california 
the company is highly dependent on sufficient volumes of natural gas that it uses for fuel in generating steam for use in its heavy oil operations in california 
if the required volume of natural gas for use in its operations were to be unavailable or too highly priced to produce heavy oil economically  the company s production could be adversely impacted 
the company s use of oil and gas price hedging contracts involves credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in net income 
the company uses hedging transactions with respect to a portion of its oil and gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce its exposure to a significant decline in the price of crude oil 
while the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines  their use may also limit future revenues from price increases 
hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations 
the company s future success depends on its ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
to maintain production levels  the company must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those depleted by production 
without successful exploration  exploitation or acquisition activities  the company s reserves  production and revenues will decline 
the company may not be able to find and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost 
in addition  substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves 
if lower oil and gas prices or operating difficulties result in the company s cash flow from operations being less than expected or limit its ability to borrow under credit arrangements  the company may be unable to expend the capital necessary to locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves 
actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves and future cash flows from those reserves most likely will vary from estimates 
estimating accumulations of oil and gas is complex 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the securities and exchange commission sec  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves  future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses most likely will vary from estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of the company s reserves 
in addition  the company may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of development and exploration and prevailing oil and gas prices 
in accordance with sec requirements  the company bases the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
if oil and gas prices decrease  the company may be required to take writedowns 
the company may be required to writedown the carrying value of its oil and gas properties when oil and gas prices are low  including basis differentials  or there are substantial downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves  increases in estimates of development costs or deterioration in exploration or production results 
the company capitalizes costs to acquire  find and develop its oil and gas properties under the successful efforts accounting method 
the net capitalized costs of the company s oil and gas properties may not exceed the fair market value 

table of contents if net capitalized costs of its oil and gas properties exceed fair value  the company must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
the company reviews the carrying value of its properties annually and at any time when events or circumstances indicate a review is necessary  based on prices in effect as of the end of the reporting period 
the carrying value of oil and gas properties is computed on a field by field basis 
once incurred  a writedown of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices increase 
the company may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors  including reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs  title to properties  and potential environmental and other liabilities 
the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain 
in connection with these assessments  the company performs a review of the subject properties that it believes to be generally consistent with industry practices 
a review will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit the company to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems 
the company often is not entitled to contractual indemnification for certain liabilities and acquires properties on an as is basis 
competitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations 
competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and proved undeveloped acreage 
major and independent oil and gas companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties  as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop their properties 
many of the company s competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater  which may adversely affect the company s ability to compete with these companies 
drilling is a high risk activity 
the company s future success will partly depend on the success of its drilling program 
in addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below  these activities involve the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  the company is often uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and producing wells 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including obtaining government and tribal required permits  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental or landowner requirements  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
the oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses  insurance may not protect the company against all of these risks 
these risks include fires  explosions  blow outs  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas  formation water or drilling fluids  natural disasters  pipe or cement failures  casing collapses  embedded oilfield drilling and service tools  abnormally pressured formations  major equipment failures  including cogeneration facilities  and environmental hazards such as oil spills  natural gas leaks  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 

table of contents if any of these events occur  the company could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  severe damage or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  investigatory and clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  suspension of operations  and repairs to resume operations 
if the company experiences any of these problems  its ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected 
the company maintains insurance against some  but not all  of these potential risks and losses 
the company may elect not to obtain insurance if it believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  it could adversely affect the company 
the company is subject to complex federal  state  local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
the company s development  exploration  production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal  state and local levels 
in addition  a portion of the company s leases in the uinta basin are  and some of the company s future leases may be  regulated by native american tribes 
environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have increased the costs to plan  design  drill  install  operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells 
under these laws and regulations  the company could also be liable for personal injuries  property damage and other damages 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of the company s operations and subject it to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years  and environmental organizations have opposed  with some success  certain drilling projects 
part of the regulatory environment in which the company operates includes  in some cases  federal requirements for obtaining environmental assessments  environmental impact studies and or plans of development before commencing exploration and production activities 
in addition  the company s activities are subject to the regulation by oil and natural gas producing states and native american tribes of conservation practices and protection of correlative rights 
these regulations affect the company s operations and limit the quantity of oil and natural gas the company may produce and sell 
a major risk inherent in the company s drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from state  local and native american tribal authorities 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  drilling permits  the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to explore on or develop its properties 
additionally  the oil and natural gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations and  consequently  adversely affect the company s profitability 
other independent oil and gas companies limited access to capital may change the company s development and exploration plans 
many independent oil and gas companies have limited access to the capital necessary to finance their activities 
as a result  some of the other working interest owners of the company s wells may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due 
these problems could cause the company to change  suspend or terminate drilling and development plans with respect to the affected project

from time to time  the company enters into crude oil and natural gas hedge contracts  the terms of which depend on various factors  including management s view of future crude oil and natural gas prices and the company s future financial commitments 
this price hedging program is designed to moderate the effects of a severe crude oil price downturn and protect certain operating margins in the company s california operations 
currently  the hedges are in the form of swaps  however  the company may use a variety of hedge instruments in the future 
the company generally attempts to hedge between and of its anticipated crude oil production and up to of its anticipated net natural gas purchased each year 
management regularly monitors the crude oil and natural gas markets and the company s financial commitments to determine if  when  and at what level some form of crude oil and or natural gas hedging or other price protection is appropriate 
all of these hedges have historically been deemed to be cash flow hedges with the mark to market valuations provided by external sources  based on prices that are actually quoted 

table of contents as of december   the company had hedge positions for of approximately  barrels per day of crude oil production at an average wti price of approximately and  mmbtu per day of natural gas consumption at an average socal price of approximately
