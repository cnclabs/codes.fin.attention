item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in item the following information includes forward looking statements  the realization of which may be affected by certain important factors discussed under risk factors 
overview we are an independent architect of enterprise class information storage infrastructures 
we derive our revenues principally from designing  installing and supporting data storage systems 
our solutions can include hardware products  such as disk arrays  tape systems and interconnection components and storage management software products 
the market for data storage products and services is large  estimated at billion in we have locations throughout the united states with the highest concentration of revenues in the central states 
we sell support service contracts to most of our customers 
when customers purchase support services through us  customers receive the benefit of integrated system wide support 
we have a qualified  independent support desk that takes calls from customers  diagnoses the issues they are facing and either solves the problem or coordinates with datalink and or vendor technical staff to meet the customer s needs 
our support service agreements with our customers include an underlying agreement with the product vendor 
the vendor provides on site support assistance if necessary 
we defer revenues and direct costs resulting from these contracts  and amortize these revenues and expenses into operations  over the term of the contracts  which are generally twelve months 
the enterprise class information storage market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
our competition includes other independent storage system suppliers  high end market resellers  distributors  consultants and our suppliers through other independent data storage solution providers  original equipment manufacturers and their own internal sales forces 
our ability to hire and retain qualified outside sales representatives and engineers with enterprise class information storage experience is critical to effectively competing in the marketplace and achieving our growth strategies 
in the past  we have experienced fluctuations in the timing of orders from our customers  and we expect to continue to experience these fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  among other things  the time required to design  test and evaluate our data storage solutions before customers deploy them  the size of customer orders  the complexity of our customers network environments  necessary system configuration to deploy our solutions and new product introductions by suppliers 
completion of our installation and configuration services may also delay recognition of revenues 
economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions to place orders with us 
as a result  our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we view the current data storage market as having significant opportunity for datalink s growth 
currently  datalink s market share is a small part of the overall market 
however  the providers of the data storage industry s products and technologies are increasing their utilization of indirect sales approaches to broaden their reach and optimize their margins 
increasingly  they are turning to companies such as datalink to sell their products 
while these trends provide opportunity for datalink  we must improve our business model to generate sustainable  profitable growth 
our model requires highly skilled sales and technical staff which results in substantial fixed costs for the company 
we believe the best way to improve our company and create long term shareholder value it to focus on building capabilities that are scaleable and a cost structure that we can better leverage 
our current strategies are focused on increasing productivity of our sales and technical teams in our existing locations 
growing our customer support revenue and market share 
we believe that our customer support services offerings are becoming increasingly attractive to companies looking for system wide integrated support 
increasing our professional services revenues 
we believe there is an opportunity to sell more of our data storage services such as implementation services  storage environment assessments and on site managed data storage services 
exploring potential regional acquisitions that we perceive can strengthen our resources and presence in key geographic locations 
to pursue these strategies  our actions include improving our training  tools and recruiting for sales teams to increase productivity 
hiring additional customer support staff and enhancing communications and technology 
developing more effective delivery of professional service solutions 
all of these plans have various challenges and risks associated with them  including that we may not increase our productivity and may lose  or not successfully recruit and retain key sales  technical or other personnel 
competition is intense and may adversely impact our profit margin 
customers have many options for data storage products and services 
we may not identify suitable acquisition candidates 
results of operations the following table shows  for the periods indicated  certain selected financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales

years ended december  product sales service sales product gross profit service gross profit 
product gross profit as a percentage of product sales 
service gross profit as a percentage of service sales net sales 
our product sales increased in from to million  and increased in from to million 
our service sales  which include customer support and installation services  remained relatively flat between and at million as compared to million  and increased in from to million 
the increase in our product sales from to reflects a greater number of customers funding large projects  particularly for enhanced data recovery technology purchases 
since  we have increased the productivity of our sales executives 
the following table shows the change in our average number of account executives and the increase in our net sales per average number of account executives 
change in average no 
of account executives change in net sales per average no 
of account executives vs 
vs 
the decline in the number of account executives reflects our closure of selected offices and turnover primarily in late calendar based on our current hiring plans we expect the average number of account executives to increase modestly in the increase in our product sales from to reflects an improvement in technology spending particularly with our large existing customers 
the slight increase in our service revenues between and reflects a million increase in consulting service revenues  offset by a million decrease in installation and configuration service revenues and a  decrease in customer support contract revenues 
in  we completed a particularly large storage solution installation and configuration project and also were unable to renew a large customer support contract 
the increase in our service revenues between and reflects an increase in installation and configuration revenues of million primarily due to a single large installation and configuration project completed in we derived approximately  and of our sales from our customer  gateway  inc  during  and  respectively 
we cannot be assured that this customer will account for a substantial portion of our future sales 
we had no other customers that comprised more than of our sales in through gross profit 
our total gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in  which was an increase from in product gross profit as a percentage of product sales increased to in as compared to in this percentage improvement reflects the increase in enhanced data recover technology solution purchases made by our customers for which we achieved a higher gross profit 
we have various programs in place with our vendors that provide economic incentives for achieving various sales performance targets 
achieving these targets contributed favorably to our product gross profit 
these vendor incentive programs constantly change and we negotiate them separately with each vendor 
while we expect the incentive programs to continue  the vendors could modify or discontinue them  which would unfavorably impact our gross profit margins 
product gross profit as a percentage of net product sales decreased to in as compared to in due to economic conditions during and  our customers sought storage solutions to meet minimum needs rather than implementing comprehensive infrastructure changes 
solutions that meet a minimum need generally carry lower product margins than comprehensive infrastructure changes 
in addition  our product gross profit percentage suffered due to the high level of pricing competition in the marketplace 
charges for excess and obsolete inventory in  and of   and  respectively  adversely affected our product gross profit 
service gross profit as a percentage of service sales decreased to in as compared to in and increased as compared to in the percentage decrease in as compared to  and the percentage increase for over  is primarily due a single large installation and configuration project in on which we achieved a higher than normal gross profit percentage 
for  we also failed to renew a couple of large customer support contracts 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include wages and commissions paid to sales and marketing personnel  travel costs and advertising  promotion and hiring expenses 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million  or of net sales for compared to million  or of net sales for and million  or of net sales for the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars is a result of higher commission expense of million due to a change in compensation plans and higher sales volume in as compared to the decrease in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars in as compared to is a result of lower bad debt expense of  and a reduction in our sales management workforce and expenses of  the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales from as compared to resulted from the increase in commission expenses due to compensation plan changes 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales from as compared to resulted primarily from higher revenues combined with reduced expenses in as we continue to selectively hire additional outside sales representatives  our sales and marketing expenses may increase without a commensurate increase in sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include wages for administrative personnel  professional fees  depreciation  communication expenses and rent and related facility expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of net sales for compared to million  or of net sales for and million  or in the decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars is due to lower depreciation expense of  on our customer relationship management system and reduced facilities expenses of  related to our office closures and subleases 
when comparing to  the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars reflects higher property taxes for our chanhassen facility of  higher training expenses to maintain vendor certifications of  and the settlement of a sales and use tax audit of  our general and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of net sales in as compared to due to the reduced spending coupled with an increase in sales 
our general and administrative expenses were flat as a percentage of net sales in as compared to engineering 
engineering expenses include employee wages and travel  hiring and training expenses for our professional engineers and technicians 
we allocate engineering costs associated with installation and configuration services and with consulting services to our cost of service sales 
engineering expenses decreased to million  or of net sales in compared to million  or of net sales in and million  or of net sales in the decrease in engineering expenses in absolute dollars from as compared to is due to an  compensation savings associated with a reduction in the number of engineers and engineering managers  offset by an increase in outside consulting expenses of  and a  increase in travel and entertainment expenses 
the decrease in engineering expenses in absolute dollars from as compared to reflects an increase in installation and configuration and consulting service revenues of  in over accordingly  we had a corresponding decline in the proportion of our engineering costs allocated to engineering expenses and an increase in our allocation to cost of service sales 
in  we also had  less of engineering travel and entertainment on installation and configuration projects than in the decrease in engineering expenses as a percentage of sales for as compared to is the result of higher revenues and lower expenses in the decrease in engineering expenses as a percentage of sales for as compared to is the result of higher revenues and lower expenses in overall cost reduction initiatives 
because of the difficult economic climate for technology spending that we faced over the past several years  and with our recent operating losses  we have actively sought to reduce costs across our business 
in october  we announced several cost reduction initiatives and management changes 
these changes resulted in a fourth quarter charge of million 
as part of these cost reduction initiatives  we reduced our staff by 
employee severance charges were  we also announced the closure of four offices 
office closing costs for lease terminations were  the office closures included closing an office and terminating personnel from our opensystems 
com  inc acquisition in november  resulting in an impairment of our customer base intangible asset 
the resulting impairment charge of the asset was  on december   we agreed to sublease approximately  of the  square feet we currently occupy as our corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota 
the initial sublease term is co terminal with our lease and is for months starting on april  and ending april  the sublessee will pay us rent ranging from approximately  per month at the beginning of the term to approximately  per month by the end of the term 
we also negotiated with our landlord to sell the acre lot adjoining our facility for  in the first quarter of  we expect to incur a one time  non cash charge of approximately million related to the sublease and lot sale 
we expect cost savings of approximately  per year as a result of the sublease agreement 
intangible amortization 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to  in compared to  in and million in the amortization relates primarily to our acquisition of the data storage and services business of opensystems 
com  inc in november we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and intangible assets  on january  this statement required that we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead test for impairment annually or whenever impairment is indicated 
for  we determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
however  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge on our opensystems 
com customer base intangible asset in connection with our cost reduction initiatives 
during  we amortized the remaining  balance of the customer base intangible asset we acquired in our july acquisition of direct connect systems  inc in  we amortized the remaining  balance of the trademark and name intangible asset we acquired in that acquisition 
this is because we do not operate under the direct connect systems name and realization of future uses became uncertain in the fourth quarter of for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
operating loss 
we incurred operating losses of million in compared to million in and million in since the restructuring in october  our financial results have steadily improved during in the fourth quarter of we generated net income of  however  we expect to post a net loss in the first quarter ending march  this relates to the million sublease charge described above  together with normal  increased first quarter recurring costs for payroll taxes  public reporting compliance and benefit accruals 
we also will incur expenses related to sarbanes oxley compliance requirements which will contribute to the expected first quarter operating loss 
we expect these compliance and other costs to decline in after the first quarter 
the reduction in our operating losses of million for as compared to is a result of million of restructuring charges included in the operating loss and the favorable impact of our cost reduction efforts in our operating results 
the decrease in our operating losses of  for as compared to is due to a improvement in sales and a reduction in amortization expense  offset by million of restructuring charges included in the operating loss 
income taxes 
we had no income tax benefit or expense in we provided for an income tax benefit of  in and  in the income tax benefit generated for represents a higher than expected federal income tax refund from our tax return 
included in the income tax provision for is a non cash charge of million related to the recording of a valuation reserve for the deferred tax asset 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon carry back to prior periods and upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the level of taxable losses in  and and the near term uncertainty of taxable income  management cannot reasonably predict when or if these deductible differences will be realized 
in addition  we do not have the ability to realize future income tax benefits on future losses 
quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly financial data for each quarter of and in our opinion  this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and includes all adjustments including all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth below

in thousands net sales gross profit operating income loss net income loss we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in our net sales as a result of a number of factors  including the length of the sales cycle with customers for large storage system evaluations and purchases  delays in storage system installations or configurations  new product introductions by suppliers and their market acceptance  delays in product shipments or other quality control difficulties  trends in the enterprise class information storage industry in general or the geographic and industry specific markets in which we are currently active  or may be in the future 
in addition  economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions to place order with us 
further  our success in integrating any acquired business or in opening any new field offices could impact our net sales 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and capital requirements through cash flows generated from operations and the proceeds from our offerings of our common stock 
our working capital was million at december  as compared to million at december  our current ratio was at december  as compared to at december  at december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million 
cash provided by operating activities for was  as compared to million in and  in significant items which impacted our operating cash flows in were a million increase in accounts receivable reflecting increasing sales activity versus the prior year 
a million increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable due primarily to increased employee bonus incentive accruals 
a net million increase in deferred customer support contracts 
while we amortize the revenues from these contracts over the life of the contract  the customer almost always pays for the contracts at the beginning of the contract period which favorably impacts our cash flows 
the cash provided in resulted primarily from a reduction in our net operating assets 
this included a million income tax refund  a million reduction in inventory shipped but not installed with fewer projects left to be installed at year end  a  reduction in field evaluation inventory and a million reduction in accounts receivable due to an improvement in our days sales outstanding 
these reductions were offset by a million reduction in accounts payable 
the cash provided in resulted primarily from a reduction in our net operating assets from timing of certain payments and receipts and a reduction in the overall level of working capital 
cash used in investing activities was  in and million during each of and in  we used this cash to purchase computer equipment  complete a data warehouse project and provide further enhancements to our business reporting software tool 
in  we used this cash to complete our own storage and data recovery project  purchase computer equipment and provide further enhancements to our customer relationship management information systems and our business reporting software tool 
in  we used this cash primarily to implement our customer relationship management information system 
cash provided by financing activities during  and was   and million  respectively 
in and  we received  and  respectively  from stock sold under our employee stock purchase plan and from the exercise of stock options 
in  we received million from a direct private offering of newly issued common stock to institutional investors and  from stock sold under our employee stock purchase plan 
this cash was partially offset by the final scheduled payment of  on a note due to a former stockholder 
the revolving credit facility we have had with a bank since june  expired in june we have elected not to pursue a new facility at this time 
we have no outstanding debt  and if the need should arise to borrow funds  we believe that we could obtain a secured facility 
for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
we have an year non cancelable operating lease for our corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota which expires in the lease requires base rental payments of approximately million in the first year and million for each subsequent year 
on december   we agreed to sublease approximately  of the  square feet we then occupied 
the initial term of the sublease is co terminal with our lease and is for months starting on april and ending on april the sublease requires rent payments ranging from  per month at the beginning of the term to approximately  per month by the end of the term 
for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   our contractual cash obligations consisting of future minimum lease payments due under non cancelable operating leases are as follows in thousands lease obligations sublease agreements net lease obligations thereafter on december   we agreed to sublease approximately  of the  square feet we then occupied as our corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota 
the initial sublease term is co terminal with our lease and is months starting on april  and ending april  the sublessee will pay us rent ranging from approximately  per month at the beginning of the term to approximately  per month by the end of the term 
the rent includes the costs of common area management  common systems repairs  real estate taxes and standard utilities 
we also negotiated with our landlord to sell the acre lot adjoining our facility for  which we originally acquired in for  we expect to incur the following charges in the first quarter of associated with our sublease and related activities item expected related charge rent reserve excess of lease expense over sublease income accelerated depreciation loss on anticipated land sale we also estimate our cash expenditures associated with our sublease and the related activities  net of the anticipated proceeds from our proposed lot sale  at  we will capitalize these cash outlays and amortize them over the lease term 
we believe that funds generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our current operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we believe if the need should arise to borrow funds  we could obtain a secured facility 
we are planning for  to million of capital expenditures through primarily related to enhancements to our management information systems 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported earnings 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the areas of customer receivables  inventories  investments  income taxes  self insurance reserves and commitments and contingencies 
we believe that the following represent the areas where we use more critical estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
we realize revenue from the design  installation and support of data storage solutions  which may include hardware  software and services 
we recognize revenue when it has met its obligations for installation or other services and collectability is reasonably assured 
product sales 
we sell software and hardware products on both a free standing basis without any services and as data storage solutions bundled with our installation and configuration services bundled arrangements 
product sales without service 
if we sell a software or hardware product and do not provide any installation or configuration services with it  we recognize the product revenues upon shipment 
product sales with service 
if we sell a bundled arrangement  then we defer recognizing any revenues on it until we finish our installation and or configuration work 
for the three years ended december   we have accounted for the hardware  software and service elements of our bundled arrangements by applying the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop pursuant to the provisions of sop  we apply contract accounting to our bundled arrangements 
in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  we apply the completed contract method 
factors we have considered in applying the completed contract method accounting include i the relatively short duration of our contracts  ii the difficulty of estimating our revenues on a percentage of completion method and iii our use of acceptance provisions on larger bundled arrangements 
for  we originally applied the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
to account for our bundled arrangements 
in  we changed the accounting guidance we apply based on our determination that the software component of our sales was more than incidental to our products or services as a whole 
however  the change did not affect the revenue amounts or the timing of our revenue recognition on bundled arrangements for this is because  under sab no 
 we also recognized revenue on our bundled arrangements only after we completed our installation and configuration services 
service sales 
in addition to installation and configuration services that are part of our bundled arrangements described above  our service sales include customer support contracts and consulting services 
on our balance sheet  deferred revenue relates to service sales for which our customer has paid us or has been invoiced but for which we have not yet performed the applicable services 
customer support contracts 
we sell service contracts to most of our customers 
these contracts are support service agreements 
we have an internal support desk that provides integrated customer support services  including configuration and usage assistance  technical advice and prompt incident detection and resolution 
our technical staff first assists a customer in identifying the source of system problems and in determining whether there is defective hardware or software 
if our customer requires on site maintenance or repair services  we arrange for a service call pursuant to underlying third party support service agreements we have with our hardware and software vendors 
when we sell a service contract as part of a bundled arrangement  we use vendor specific objective evidence to allocate revenue to the service contract element 
in all cases  we defer revenues and direct costs resulting from our service contracts and amortize them into operations over the term of the contracts  which are generally twelve months 
we are contractually obligated to provide or arrange to provide these underlying support services to our customers in the unlikely event that the hardware or software vendor  or its designee  fails to perform according to the terms of its contact 
consulting services 
some of our customers engage us to analyze their existing storage architectures and offer our recommendations 
other customers engage us to assist them on site with extended data storage projects  to support their data storage environments and to help with long term data storage design challenges 
for these types of consulting services that do not include the sale of hardware or software products  we recognize revenues as we perform these services 
gross reporting of revenues 
we report our revenues from the sale of hardware and software products on a gross  rather than a net  basis 
in reporting our revenues on a gross basis  we considered that we are the primary obligor to our customers 
we are responsible for fulfillment  including the acceptability of the products and services to our customers 
we have the risk of loss for inventory and credit 
we establish the prices for our products and services with our customers 
we are responsible for the installation and configuration services ordered by our customers 
commission expense 
we utilize a direct internal sales force to generate virtually all of our revenues 
we pay our sales people a combination of base salary and commissions 
we pay commissions based on the amount of gross profit generated from the products and services sold 
we match commissions to the appropriate transactions and recognize commission expense at the time we recognize the related revenues and gross profit 
inventory 
we periodically review  estimate and adjust our reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the inventory cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
results could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions  length of industry downturn  or if products become obsolete because of technical advancements in the industry 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and reclassified  of assembled workforce to goodwill 
as a result  we have ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on total market capitalization as compared to the carrying value of our net assets 
if our total market capitalization is at or below the carrying value of our net assets  it may prompt us to engage a third party valua tion firm to perform a valuation of us to further assess whether our goodwill or other intangibles are impaired pursuant to sfas we consider our goodwill impairment test estimates critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts 
other intangible assets consist of customer lists 
we amortize customer lists using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of five years 
we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value is not recoverable 
income taxes 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly assess the likelihood that we will recover our deferred tax assets from future taxable income we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts we believe are more likely than not to be realizable 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
if we determine it is more likely than not that we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we will adjust our earnings for the deferred tax in the period we make this determination 
as a result of our cumulative losses over the past two years and the full utilization of our loss carry back potential  we concluded during the fourth quarter of fiscal to make a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance at december  was million 
in addition  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on any future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board published fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement  which will begin to apply in our third quarter of  requires us to recognize the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  in our financial statements 
we are to measure this cost based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
the statement covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements  including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
the statement will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock options based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we then will recognize the cost over the period we require the employee to provide services for the award 
the new statement allows two methods for transitioning our expensing of share based transactions 
we are studying the new statement and have not yet determined which transition method we will apply 
under the modified prospective transition method  we would use the fair value based accounting method for all employee awards granted  modified or settled after the effective date 
as of the effective date  we would base the compensation cost for the non vested portion of awards outstanding as of that date on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated under our current accounting methods 
as a result  we would not re measure the grant date fair value estimate for the unvested portion of awards granted prior to the effective date 
as part of this transition method  we would also decide whether to apply the new statement to only our third quarter of and subsequent periods  or to all of under the modified retrospective method of transition  we would need to revise our previously issued financial statements to recognize employee compensation cost for all prior periods we present in our financial statements 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years 
we cannot assure you that inflation will not adversely affect our business in the future 
risk factors as indicated in this annual report under the caption note regarding forward looking statements  certain information contained in this annual report consists of forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements made in this annual report include the following we have incurred substantial net losses and may not achieve profitability 
except for the fourth quarter of  we have incurred net losses each quarter since the fourth quarter of we also expect to incur a net loss in the first quarter of we cannot assure that we will return to profitability in the foreseeable future  or at all 
our continued losses may adversely affect our stock price 
competition could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues or profitability 
the enterprise class information storage market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
as technologies change rapidly  we expect that competition will increase in the future 
we compete with independent storage system suppliers to the high end market and numerous resellers  distributors and consultants 
we also compete in the storage systems market with general purpose computer suppliers 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  purchasing and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of products and deliver competitive products at lower end user prices 
some of our current and potential competitors include our suppliers 
we are not the exclusive supplier of any data storage product we offer 
instead  our suppliers market their products through other independent data storage solution providers  original equipment manufacturers and  often  through their own internal sales forces 
we believe direct competition from our suppliers is likely to increase if  as expected  the data storage industry continues to consolidate 
this consolidation would probably result in fewer suppliers with greater resources to devote to internal sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  our suppliers have established and will probably continue to establish cooperative relationships with other suppliers and other data storage solution providers 
these cooperative relationships are often intended to enable our suppliers to offer comprehensive storage solutions  which compete with those we offer 
if our relationships with our suppliers become adversarial  it will be more difficult for us to stay ahead of industry developments and provide our customers with the type of service they expect from us 
in addition  most of our customers already employ in house technical staffs 
to the extent a customer s in house technical staff develops sophisticated storage systems expertise  the customer may be less likely to seek our services 
further  we compete with storage service providers who manage  store and backup their customers data at off site  networked data storage locations 
we derive a significant percentage of our revenues from a small number of customers 
in  we had no customers that accounted for at least of our revenues 
however  our top six customers collectively accounted for of our revenues 
because we intend to continue to seek out large projects  we expect that a significant percentage of our revenues will continue to come from a small number of customers  although the composition of our key customers is likely to change from year to year 
if we fail to obtain a growing number of large projects each year  our revenues and profitability will likely be adversely affected 
in addition  our reliance on large projects makes it more likely that our revenues and profits will fluctuate unpredictably from year to year 
unpredictable revenue and profit fluctuations may make our stock price more volatile and lead to a decline in our stock price 
our revenue recognition policies unpredictably defer reporting of our revenues 
we increasingly sell complex enterprise class information storage solutions 
we do not recognize revenues from our sale of hardware and software products to our customers until we complete our required installation or configuration of these products 
installation and configuration of these solutions requires significant coordination with our customers and vendors 
therefore  even if we have shipped all products to our customers  we may be unable to control the timing of product installation and configuration 
these delays prevent us from recognizing revenue on products we ship and may adversely affect our quarterly reported revenues 
as a result  our stock price may decline 
we rely on only a few key suppliers and would suffer materially if we could not obtain their products 
we rely on our close relationships with our suppliers to provide access to products and new technology necessary to design and implement leading edge enterprise class information storage solutions for our customers 
we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our suppliers 
in many instances  we rely upon only two or three suppliers for each of our key products 
our reliance on these suppliers leaves us vulnerable to an inadequate supply of required products  price increases  late deliveries and poor product quality 
disruption or termination of the supply of products from our suppliers for any reason would likely prevent or delay our shipments to our customers 
our customers expect reliable and prompt service from us 
if we cannot obtain necessary components  or the components we obtain are unreliable or unexpectedly expensive  we will not meet our customers expectations 
if we cannot meet our customers expectations  our business will suffer considerably 
our business depends on our ability to hire and retain technical personnel 
our future operating results depend upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified engineers with enterprise class information storage solutions experience 
if we fail to recruit and retain additional engineering personnel  or if continued losses require us in the future to terminate employment of some of these personnel  we will experience greater difficulty realizing our growth strategy  which could negatively affect our business  financial condition and stock price 
we generally do not have employment agreements with our key employees 
our future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our executive officers  managers  salespeople  engineers and other technical personnel  many who have substantial experience in our industry and would be difficult to replace 
in general  we do not have employment  non competition or nondisclosure agreements with our officers or employees  including our executive officers 
accordingly  our employees may voluntarily leave us at any time and work for our competitors 
our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to retain our current employees and hire new employees 
any failure to retain our key employees will make it much more difficult for us to maintain our operations and attain our growth objectives and could therefore be expected to adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and stock price 
our long sales cycle may cause fluctuating operating results  which may adversely affect our stock price 
our sales cycle is typically long and unpredictable  making it difficult to plan our business 
economic conditions over the past several years have increased this uncertainty 
our long sales cycle requires us to invest resources in potential projects that may not occur 
in addition  our long and unpredictable sales cycle may cause us to experience significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results 
it can also result in delayed revenues  difficulty in matching revenues with expenses and increased expenditures 
our business  operating results or financial condition and stock price may suffer as a result of any of these factors 
if the data storage industry fails to develop compelling new storage technologies  our business may suffer 
rapid and complex technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards increase demand for our services 
because of this  our future success depends in part on the data storage industry s ability to continue to develop leading edge storage technology solutions 
our customers utilize our services in part because they know that newer technologies offer them significant benefits over the older technologies they are using 
if the data storage industry ceases to develop compelling new storage solutions  or if a single data storage standard becomes widely accepted and implemented  it will be more difficult to sell new data storage systems to our customers 
accounting for equity compensation future accounting changes may adversely impact our expected financial results 
under current accounting rules  we do not record charges to our financial statements in connection with the grant at fair market value of employee stock options 
however  these accounting rules will change during our new option related expenses may unpredictably affect our reported results  which may adversely affect our stock price 
we may not be fully compliant with sarbanes oxley regulations 
beginning with the calendar year end december   we will be required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of to formally assess and attest that our internal controls are sufficient to provide accurate reporting of financial results 
we will engage our independent accountants to perform an audit of our assessment and issue an opinion on the sufficiency of our internal controls 
we are in the beginning phases of our assessment 
although we expect to incur significant costs to achieve compliance  we do not know if we will be fully compliant with the regulations by the end of if we are not compliant  we may incur additional costs to become compliant and our stock price could be unfavorably impacted 
control by our existing stockholders could discourage the potential acquisition of our business 
currently  our executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
acting together  these insiders may be able to elect our entire board of directors and control the outcome of all other matters requiring stockholder approval 
this voting concentration may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our management or control or otherwise discourage potential acquirers from attempting to gain control of us 
if potential acquirers are deterred  you may lose an opportunity to profit from a possible acquisition premium in our stock price 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering  and may continue to be volatile 
we cannot assure you that our stock price will increase  or even that it will not decline significantly from the price you pay 
our stock price may be adversely affected by many factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  including those resulting from changes in accounting rules  announcements of technical innovations  new products or services offered by us  our suppliers or our competitors  changes in estimates by securities analysts of our future financial performance  and general market conditions  including the effects of economic conditions over the past several years and war and terrorism threats 
our governing documents and minnesota law may discourage the potential acquisitions of our business 
our board of directors may issue additional shares of capital stock and establish their rights  preferences and classes  in some cases without stockholder approval 
in addition  we are subject to anti takeover provisions of minnesota law 
these provisions may deter or discourage takeover attempts and other changes in control of us not approved by our board of directors 
if potential acquirers are deterred  you may lose an opportunity to profit from a possible acquisition premium in our stock price 
future goodwill impairment may unpredictably affect our financial results 
effective january   we no longer amortize goodwill 
instead  we perform impairment analyses of our goodwill at least annually or when we believe there is an impairment 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we do not believe that we have any material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required 
the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had million of cash and money market accounts 
a decrease in market rates of interest would have no material effect on the value of these assets or the related interest income due to the nature of money market accounts 
we have no short or long term debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we market and sell all of our products in the united states 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
equity price risk 
we do not own any equity investments 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct equity price risk
