item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary and outlook redwood is a financial institution located in mill valley  california 
we invest in  credit enhance  and securitize residential and commercial real estate loans and securities 
our earnings  as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  totaled million or per share for  as compared to million or per share for  and million or per share for our gaap return on equity was in  in  and in our results were driven by the quality of our existing real estate loan backed investments  a favorable operating environment  excellent credit results  favorable prepayment patterns  increased book value per share giving us a greater amount of equity per share with which to generate earnings  increased capital efficiencies  increased operating efficiencies  and income generated from residential ces that we owned at a discount to face value that were called during at full face value 
during  we earned an estimated million of total taxable income pre tax income as calculated for tax purposes  of which an estimated million was reit taxable income 
we declared million of dividends for  totaling per share 
our primary source of revenue is interest income from the real estate loan backed securities we own 
this interest income consists of the monthly loan payments made by homeowners and to a lesser degree  commercial property owners on the real estate loans that underlie these securities 
in addition  during the last two years we have earned a significant amount of call income a form of gain on sale income from residential ces 
redwood has elected to be taxed as a reit 
as such  we are not required to pay corporate income taxes on the reit taxable income that we distribute to stockholders as dividends 
we are required to distribute to stockholders as dividends the majority of the reit taxable income our taxable income excluding income earned in non reit taxable subsidiaries that we earn 
during  we continued to satisfy our dividend distribution requirements as a reit 
our regular dividend rate during was per share per quarter 
for  we declared total common dividends of per share regular dividends and special dividends 
in and  we declared total common dividends of and per share  respectively 
for  our board of directors has indicated that it intends to authorize payments of regular dividends at the rate of per share per quarter per share per year 
looking ahead  we believe our earnings will continue to benefit from the quality of our existing assets 
however  the extraordinary market conditions of the last few years attractive acquisition pricing  excellent credit results  and favorable prepayment rate patterns that increased our realized yields on our seasoned assets are unlikely to continue or to be repeated 
we are also facing  and expect to continue to face  increased competition  higher acquisition pricing  and a reduced supply of high quality loan acquisition opportunities 
the volume of high quality fixed rate  hybrid rate  and arm securitizations has decreased as the quantity and quality of new originations of quality jumbo loans decreases  and as banks and other financial institutions increase their purchases of residential real estate loans and hold these assets unsecuritized 
we expect that these market conditions of reduced supply  increased competition and high acquisition prices will likely continue 
as our existing earning assets pay down  we will continue to acquire new assets if we can do so while earning our minimum hurdle rate of return a high probability in our opinion of earning a return on equity before overhead and while meeting our quality standards real estate loans on which we take first loss credit risk should be high quality loans relative to us real estate loans as a whole 
we believe we can source new assets with attractive return potential  but not in the same 
table of contents volumes as we did in in addition  we do not expect new asset acquisitions to generate the yields over their lives that will equal the yields we are currently reporting on our more seasoned assets 
a substantial portion of our income in the last two years has come from gains from calls and sales of residential ces 
returns from these sources are highly variable and not readily predictable 
as we have a smaller portfolio of callable securities  we expect call income to decline significantly from levels achieved in and improvements in our return on equity  earnings  and dividends have been driven in part by increased capital efficiencies that we have realized through selling or re securitizing assets recycling capital 
in achieving these capital efficiencies  in some cases we have increased our potential earnings volatility with respect to credit risk and certain types of prepayment risks 
we intend to sell additional securities in that have appreciated due to seasoning  strong credit performance  and an increase in asset prices generally 
we have also sold securities that are not performing up to expectations with respect to credit quality or that are in the lower half of credit quality for our portfolio 
we anticipate that these sales will generate gains  which will add to reported gaap earnings  taxable earnings  and perhaps our dividend payments during on going gaap and tax earnings may be reduced  however  as many of the assets we sold and may sell currently generate a high yield on their gaap or tax basis even if their yield based on market value may be relatively low 
we may or may not undertake to raise capital during the need for or timing of any such undertaking is uncertain 
after taking into consideration our internal risk based capital guidelines that suggest how much capital we need to support our permanent asset portfolio and securitization inventory  we had million of excess unutilized capital at year end our general goal is to maintain unutilized capital at a level that will support three to nine months of business growth 
our acquisition volume of permanent portfolio assets has slowed  and our securitization volume and inventories have also declined 
this trend may continue  or it could reverse and our need for capital could become greater 
in addition  we have sold assets and we intend to sell additional assets and we continue to pursue other ways to free cash for investment through capital recycling 
we continue to issue common shares through our direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment program  typically at a rate of million to million per month 
as a result of these various factors  it is difficult to project when we may seek to raise additional capital through other means 
to the extent we issue stock at prices in excess of book value per share  we may have an opportunity for enhanced earnings and dividends per share in the future because we will have a greater amount of equity per share available to generate cash flow 
stock issuances may  however  reduce the amount of special dividends on a per share basis from what might otherwise be payable in and or in the event that we have a strong year of taxable income generation in overall  in the long term  we believe we will continue to be a leading competitor as a result of our operating efficiencies  our intense and specialized business focus  and the relationships we have developed with our business partners 
although we believe it is unlikely we will be able to sustain our earnings  return on equity  and special dividend distributions on a per share basis at s extraordinary levels  we believe over the next few years we will continue to generate earnings  cash flows  and a return on equity that are reasonably attractive when viewed on an absolute basis rather than relative to the past and that are sufficient to sustain our regular dividend payments 
we continue to believe that a reasonable assumption for the range of return on equity we could most likely earn on average over the long term is to by contrast  we earned a return on equity on a gaap basis during 

table of contents balance sheet structure management s approach to investments  risks  and returns focuses on managing a portfolio of permanent assets that are funded with equity and generating high quality  long term cash flows 
these permanent assets may not be specifically identifiable on our consolidated balance sheets due to financing treatment under gaap 
however  management believes that to further understand redwood s accounting treatment as well as its economic risks and opportunities  a review of redwood s permanent asset portfolio is warranted  in addition to the discussion on the gaap presentation throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we currently sell all of the residential real estate loans we acquire to securitization entities 
we also sell the bulk of the real estate securities we acquire to cdo securitization entities 
in a securitization or resecuritization transaction  we sell the assets to be securitized to an abs entity that is legally separate and bankruptcy remote from redwood and its subsidiaries 
the sale of these assets to a securitization entity from redwood or its subsidiaries is always a true sale for legal purposes and is usually a sale for tax purposes 
a taxable gain or loss for redwood or its subsidiaries is generated in most cases when redwood or its subsidiaries sells assets to an abs entity 
the entity creates asset backed securities  each representing an ownership interest in the pool of assets owned by the entity 
the entity sells the abs it has created to capital markets investors  and remits the proceeds received from the sale of these securities to redwood as payment for the assets redwood sold to the entity 
redwood has a taxable gain if the cash proceeds received from the entity for the sale plus the market value of any abs that redwood acquires from the entity exceeds redwood s basis in the assets sold to the entity if a securitization is a financing for tax purposes  however  no tax gain is generated 
redwood often chooses to acquire for its permanent asset portfolio a small portion of the abs sold by these abs securitization entities 
redwood s maximum loss exposure to the assets and liabilities of these abs entities is generally limited in most circumstances to the investment redwood makes in any of the securities issued by the entity 
redwood is obligated in some limited circumstances to repurchase securitized loans from securitization entities 
however  in these cases redwood usually has the right to sell a securitized loan back to the origination company that sold the loan to redwood 
as a result  redwood s net exposure to repurchase risk is likely to be limited 
as of december   we accounted for all of the securitization transactions undertaken by redwood sponsored abs entities as financings rather than sales for gaap financial reporting purposes 
as a result  the sale of assets from redwood to the abs entity is accounted for under gaap as a pledge  and no gain or loss on sale occurs for gaap purposes 
under this gaap treatment  we consolidate on our balance sheet all of the assets sold to each securitization entity as well as the outstanding abs obligations issued by the securitization entity 
as a result of this gaap treatment  the abs securities issued from these sponsored entities that redwood owns in its permanent asset portfolio are not shown on our consolidated balance sheets  but rather are represented by the excess of assets over liabilities consolidated from the securitization entities 
redwood reported billion of consolidated earning assets on december  assets owned directly by redwood including both investments and inventory that were reported on redwood s consolidated balance sheets had a reported value of million 
the remainder of reported assets billion were owned by and consolidated from abs entities that were sponsored by redwood from which redwood acquired for its permanent asset portfolio certain of the more risky abs issued 
the assets owned by redwood that were acquired from redwood sponsored abs entities are not shown on redwood s consolidated balance sheets

of this billion  million of these loans as of december  were held as inventory for sale to a securitization entity 
for the remainder of this billion  redwood does not own these loans but rather has acquired the residential ces from redwood sponsored securitization entities as permanent assets 
helocs make up million of total managed loans at december   and are reported in a separate line item on our consolidated balance sheets 
redwood does not own these loans either  but we do own the first loss credit risk of these loans through purchases of first loss securities from the securitization of helocs that we sponsored 
the remainder of our managed residential loans or billion as of december  are loans underlying residential ces acquired from securitizations sponsored by others these securities are shown as our residential credit enhancement securities portfolio on our consolidated balance sheets 
only certain of the securities redwood actually owns are included in our securities portfolio as reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
all of the real estate loan securities that redwood owns or consolidates on its balance sheet can be characterized as follows residential ces acquired from abs securitizations sponsored by others 
these securities are generally funded with equity if they are owned directly by redwood million at december  
a portion of these assets million at december  are owned directly by redwood but held temporarily as inventory for future sale to abs securitizations  these assets are typically funded with both short term debt at december  and equity 
another portion of these assets million at december  has been sold to acacia cdo entities  the assets of which are consolidated onto redwood s consolidated balance sheets 
all these securities are included 
table of contents in residential loan credit enhancement securities on redwood s consolidated balance sheets and are discussed above 
residential ces  io securities  cdo equity  and similar securities acquired by redwood from abs entities sponsored by redwood 
these assets are funded with equity 
in addition  redwood also acquires as inventory investment grade abs from the securitizations it sponsors and  after a period of time  sells these securities to acacia entities for re securitization 
none of these securities are shown on redwood s consolidated balance sheets 
instead  all of the assets loans and securities and liabilities of the related entities are consolidated onto redwood s consolidated balance sheets 
diverse residential and commercial real estate securities  generally with credit ratings of aaa through b  that were acquired by redwood on a temporary basis as inventory for future sale to abs securitization entities acacia 
redwood funds these assets million at december  with equity and short term debt million at december  
these are reported as part of redwood s securities portfolio on our consolidated balance sheets 
diverse residential and commercial securities  generally with credit ratings of aaa through b  that were acquired by redwood from third party securitizations and subsequently sold to abs securitization entities sponsored by redwood billion at december  
redwood no longer funds these assets  as they have been sold 
they continue to be shown as part of redwood s securities portfolio on our consolidated balance sheets because the assets of these abs entities are consolidated with redwood s for reporting purposes 
the performance of these consolidated assets may affect redwood s results  as the securities issued by those abs entities that redwood has acquired for our long term investment portfolio may perform poorly if the underlying assets shown on redwood s consolidated balance sheet perform poorly 
commercial loan ces  totaling million at december   that are funded by redwood with equity and are reported as part of redwood s securities portfolio on our consolidated balance sheets 
other securities such as cdo equity acquired from securitizations sponsored by others that we hold with equity funding that are not slated for sale to a securitization  and that are included as part of the securities portfolio 
redwood s debt was million at december   all of which was short term debt 
for gaap purposes  redwood consolidates and reports all of the assets owned by entities redwood sponsors as redwood balance sheet assets and all of the abs issued by these entities as redwood balance sheet abs obligations 
redwood s maximum financial exposure to the entity  however  is typically limited to the net investment redwood makes in the abs certificates it acquires from the entity 
redwood s maximum financial exposure is usually less than and often less than of the assets and abs obligations reported on its balance sheet that are consolidated from abs entities redwood has sponsored 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the critical accounting policies and how changes in estimates might affect our financial results and statements are discussed below 
management discusses the ongoing development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
establishing valuations and accounting for changes in valuations we estimate the fair value of certain assets and interest rate agreements using available market information and other appropriate valuation methodologies 
residential real estate loans held for sale are generally valued on a pool basis while commercial real estate loans held for sale and securities available for sale are valued on a loan specific basis 
we believe the estimates we use reflect the market values we may be able to receive should we choose to sell them 
our estimates are inherently subjective in 
table of contents nature and involve matters of uncertainty and judgment in interpreting relevant market and other data 
many factors are necessary to estimate market values  including  but not limited to  interest rates  prepayment rates  amount and timing of credit losses  supply and demand  liquidity  and other market factors 
we apply these factors to each of our assets  as appropriate  in order to determine market values 
in addition to our valuation processes  we are active acquirers and occasional sellers of the assets and interest rate agreements consolidated on our balance sheet 
thus  we believe that we have the ability to understand and determine changes in assumptions that are taking place in the marketplace and make appropriate changes in our assumptions for valuing assets in our portfolio 
in addition  we use third party sources to validate certain valuation estimates 
valuation adjustments to real estate loans held for sale are reported as net recognized losses and valuation adjustments on our consolidated statements of income in the applicable period of the adjustment 
in general  adjustments to the fair value of securities available for sale are reported through our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity within the cumulative unrealized gains and losses classified as accumulated other comprehensive income 
the exception to this treatment of securities available for sale is when a specific impairment is identified or a decrease in fair value results from a decline in estimated cash flows that may be considered an other than temporary change 
in such cases  the resulting decrease in fair value is recorded in net recognized gains losses and valuation adjustments on our consolidated statements of income in the applicable period of the adjustment 
we review our fair value calculations on an ongoing basis 
we monitor the critical performance factors for each loan and security 
our expectations of future performance are shaped by input and analyses received from external sources  internal models  and our own judgment and experience 
we review our existing assumptions relative to our and the market s expectations of future events and make adjustments to the assumptions that may change our market values and yields 
changes in perceptions regarding future events can have a material impact on the value of our assets 
should such changes or other factors result in significant changes in the market values  our net income  and or book value could be adversely affected 
revenue recognition when recognizing revenue on consolidated earning assets  we employ the effective yield method to account for purchase premiums  discounts  and other net capitalized fees or costs associated with purchasing and financing real estate loans and securities 
for consolidated real estate loans  the effective yield method is applied as prescribed under sfas for loans acquired prior to july   the effective yield is determined using interest rates as they change over time and future anticipated principal prepayments 
for loans acquired subsequent to that date  the initial interest rate of the loans and future anticipated principal prepayments are used in determining the effective yield 
for our investment grade securities  the effective yield method is applied as prescribed under sfas or eitf using anticipated principal prepayment 
the use of these methods requires us to project cash flows over the remaining life of each asset and certain liabilities 
these projections include assumptions about interest rates  prepayment rates  timing and amount of credit losses  when certain tests will be met that may allow for changes in payments made under the structure of securities  estimates regarding the likelihood and timing of calls of securities at par  and other factors 
we review our cash flow projections on an ongoing basis and monitor these projections based on input and analyses received from external sources  internal models  and our own judgment and experience 
we constantly review our assumptions and make adjustments to the cash flows as deemed necessary 
there can be no assurance that our assumptions used to generate future cash flows  or the current period s yield for each asset  will prove to be accurate 
our consolidated residential loan ces have below investment grade credit ratings and represent subordinated interests in pools of high quality jumbo residential real estate loans 
as a result of the relatively high credit risks of these investments  we are able to purchase ces at a discount to principal par value 
a portion of the purchase discount is subsequently accreted as interest income under the effective yield method while the remaining portion of the purchase discount is considered as a form of credit protection 
the amount of credit protection is based upon our assessment of various factors affecting our assets  including economic conditions  characteristics of the underlying loans  delinquency status  past performance of similar loans  and external 
table of contents credit protection 
we use a variety of internal and external credit risk analysis  cash flow modeling  and portfolio analytical tools to assist us in our assessment 
under the effective yield method  decreases in our credit loss assumptions embedded in our cash flow forecasts could result in increasing yields being recognized from residential loan ces 
in addition  faster than anticipated prepayment rates would also tend to increase realized yields over the remaining life of the asset 
in contrast  increases in our credit loss assumptions and or slower than anticipated prepayment rates could result in lower yields being recognized under the effective yield method and may represent a permanent impairment  in which case the asset may be written down to its fair value through our consolidated statements of income 
credit reserves for consolidated residential and commercial real estate loans held for investment  we establish and maintain credit reserves that we believe represent probable credit losses that will result from impairment and inherent losses existing in our consolidated residential and commercial real estate loans held for investment as of the date of the financial statements 
the reserves for credit losses are adjusted by taking provision for credit losses recorded as a reduction in interest income on residential and commercial real estate loans on our consolidated statements of income 
the reserves consist of estimates of specific loan impairment and estimates of collective losses on pools of loans with similar characteristics 
to calculate the credit reserve for credit losses for the residential real estate loans and helocs  we determine inherent losses by applying loss factors default  the timing of defaults  and the loss severity upon default that can be specifically applied to each of our loan pools 
the following factors are considered and applied in such determination on going analysis of the pool of loans including  but not limited to  the age of the loans  underwriting standards  business climate  economic conditions  geographic considerations  past performance of similar loans  and other observable data  historical loss rates  relevant environmental factors  relevant market research and publicly available third party reference loss rates  trends in delinquencies and charge offs  effects in changes in credit concentrations  and prepayment assumptions 
once we determine applicable default  the timing of the defaults  and severity of loss upon the default we estimate the expected losses of each pool of loans over their expected lives 
we then estimate the timing of these losses and the losses probable to occur over an effective loss confirmation period 
this period is defined as the range of time between the probable occurrence of a credit loss such as the initial deterioration of the borrower s financial condition and the confirmation of that loss the actual impairment or charge off of the loan 
the losses expected to occur within the effective loss confirmation period are the basis of our credit reserves because we believe those losses exist as of the reported date of the financial statements 
we re evaluate the level of our credit reserves on at least a quarterly basis and record credit provision  charge offs  and recoveries monthly 
the credit reserve for credit losses for the commercial real estate loan portfolio includes a detailed analysis of each loan and the underlying property 
the following factors are considered and applied in such determination 
on going analysis of each individual loan consideration of current collateral values on going evaluation of fair values of collateral using current appraisals and other valuations discounted cash flow analysis security perfection borrower s ability to meet obligations additionally  if the loan becomes reo or reclassified as held for sale  specific valuations also include analysis of the underlying collateral 

table of contents accounting for derivatives instruments interest rate agreements we incorporate the use of derivative instruments to manage certain risks such as market value risk and interest rate risk 
currently  the majority of our interest rate agreements are used to match the duration of liabilities to assets 
the derivative instruments we employ include  but are not limited to  interest rate swaps  interest rate options  options on swaps  futures contracts  options on futures contracts  options on forward purchases  and other similar derivatives 
we collectively refer to these derivative instruments as interest rate agreements 
on the date the interest rate agreement is entered into  we designate the interest rate agreement under gaap as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge  or held for trading trading instrument 
we currently elect under gaap to account for the bulk of our interest rate agreements as cash flow hedges 
we record these derivatives at their estimated fair market value  and generally record changes in their fair value in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
these amounts are reclassified to our consolidated statements of income over the effective hedge period as the hedged item affects earnings 
any ineffective portions of the cash flow hedges are included in our consolidated statements of income 
we may discontinue gaap hedge accounting prospectively when we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item  it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur  a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate 
results of operations acquisitions and securitizations during the fourth quarter of  we acquired billion of adjustable rate residential real estate loans as inventory for our sequoia securitization program 
we sold billion of residential real estate loans to sequoia  sequoia  and sequoia abs entities during the quarter 
at the end of the fourth quarter  our inventory of loans being held for sale to sequoia was million 
we also owned million of loans being held for sale to third parties 
for gaap reporting purposes  all of the assets and liabilities of these three new sequoia entities as well as the inventory owned by redwood were included on our consolidated balance sheets as residential real estate loans 
redwood acquired million of residential and commercial real estate securities during the fourth quarter as inventory for our acacia cdo securitization program 
redwood sold million of securities to acacia cdo during the quarter  and finished the quarter with an inventory of securities for sale to acacia of million 
acacia cdo created and sold million of abs 
all of the assets and liabilities of acacia were included on our consolidated balance sheets 
during the fourth quarter of  residential loan ces with a principal value of million were called  generating a gaap gain of million and an estimated tax gain of million 
interest income total interest income as reported for gaap purposes on a consolidated basis for was million  an increase of from the million of interest income revenue in  and an increase of from the million of interest income in total interest income consists of cash interest payments we receive on consolidated earning assets  plus income from amortization of discount for assets acquired at prices below principal value  less expenses for amortization of premium for assets acquired at prices above principal value  less credit provision expenses

in addition  our yield was increased by a decrease in net discount amortization expense and lower credit provision expenses

we also benefited from faster than anticipated prepayment rates and strong credit results on loans underlying our residential loan credit enhancement securities  resulting in increased amortization of the unamortized discount into income 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased in from this decrease was the result of lower variable stock option expense and lower excise taxes

the efficiency ratio is total operating expenses before excise tax and vsoe as a percentage of net interest income nii  and has decreased from in 
table of contents to in to in the reconciliation of gaap operating expense to operating expense before excise tax and variance stock option expense is provided in the table below 
management excludes excise tax and variable stock option expenses in determining this efficiency ratio 
thus  by excluding these items  management believes that we are providing a more comparable ratio to other companies 
excise taxes are a function of the timing of dividend distributions and are not necessarily an ongoing expense 
variable stock option expenses are a non cash function of redwood s stock price  and are not indicative of the ongoing expenses needed to operate the business

fixed compensation expenses for increased by over after increasing from to increases in staff related to the increased scale of the operations of our business have led to these higher expenses 
variable compensation includes employee bonuses  which are based on individual employee performance and the adjusted return on equity earned by redwood  as well as dividend equivalent right expenses related to dividends on certain outstanding stock options 
variable compensation decreased in  as compared to  due primarily to the exercise of stock options by employees in and  resulting in lower dividend equivalent right expenses on stock options during as compared to our dividend equivalent expenses were higher in than in due to the relative size of the special dividends declared

table of contents expense recognized on these stock options is becoming less sensitive to changes in our stock price due to the decreasing number of these options that are outstanding as a result of stock option exercises by redwood employees 
the remainder of these options will expire or be exercised in in the last two years  redwood has delayed the distribution via dividends of a portion of its reit taxable income  as a result  under the reit tax rules  redwood has paid an excise tax 
this excise tax is included in operating expenses on our consolidated statements of income 
we continue to add to our staff as we grow 
nevertheless  we believe our productivity and efficiency may continue to improve  with our equity and earnings growing more rapidly than the number of our employees and operating expenses 
in addition  we expect some of our operating expenses related to stock options dividend equivalent right expenses and variable stock option expenses to decline over time as the applicable options are exercised or expire

rapid prepayment rates over the last four years have accelerated the first potential call dates of the securitizations we credit enhance 
we expect gains from calls to continue  although at an unpredictable and slower rate for the next few years 
accounting rules sfas and eitf require us to review the projected discounted cash flows on certain of our assets based on credit  prepayment  and other assumptions  and to mark to market through our income statement those assets that have experienced any deterioration in discounted projected cash flows as compared to the previous projection that could indicate permanent impairment as defined by gaap 
assets with reduced discounted projected cash flows are written down in value through a non cash income statement charge if the current market value for that asset is below our current basis 
if the market value is above our basis  our basis remains unchanged and there is no gain recognized in income 
with rising interest rates and slowing prepayment rates  we generally expect an increase in valuation adjustments to reported earnings over time 
it is difficult to predict the timing or magnitude of these adjustments  the quarterly adjustment could be substantial 
our net reported sfas and eitf write downs were million in due primarily to the timing of cash flows as a result of slower prepayment assumptions related to certain securities purchased at a discount 
these write downs totaled million in and million in we have not sought hedge accounting treatment for a portion of our interest rate agreements interest rate swaps  futures  and related instruments

by retaining a portion of our income  we seek to build equity per share  and thus potential earnings and dividends per share  over time 
our current provision for corporate income taxes for redwood is estimated based on a combined federal and state corporate tax rate of on the amount of anticipated reit ordinary income to be retained for the year

our reit taxable income differs from our gaap income 
for example  our gaap income is reduced by credit provision expenses accrued in anticipation of credit losses while taxable income is reduced by credit losses only when they are realized 
additionally  unrealized market price valuation adjustments for gaap purposes are generally not included in taxable income  and certain compensation related items are treated differently for gaap and tax purposes both in terms of timing and also total expenses over time 
most of the securitizations we sponsor are treated as sales of the assets for tax purposes 
this creates a realized gain or loss for tax purposes which is a component of the taxable income we earn in our taxable subsidiaries 
essentially  when we recognize gains on securitizations that we sponsor  we are accelerating for abs tax purposes income that we will recognize for gaap purposes over time in the form of excess interest income on whole loans over long term interest expense 
conversely  these securitizations we sponsor are accounted for as financings for gaap purposes  so no gain or loss is recognized at the close of the securitization transaction 
as the number of the securitizations that we sponsor grows over time  the excess of net gaap interest income over taxable interest income will likely continue to grow

taxable income per share is measured as the estimated pretax taxable income earned in a calendar quarter dividend by the number of shares outstanding at the end of that quarter 
annual taxable income per share is the sum of the four quarterly taxable earnings per share calculations

one potential future tax law change that we are aware of  which is described in irs announcement  could  for example  cause our taxable income and associated dividend distributions to decrease in future periods 
however  we do not currently expect this particular potential future tax law change to have a material impact on either our taxable income or our dividend rate 
during  taxable income in the form of net capital gains resulting from the call of some of our residential ces totaled approximately million 
our income from call activity was long term capital gain income for tax purposes 
during  of our dividends distributed were characterized as a distribution of long term capital gain income and the remaining was characterized as a distribution of ordinary income 
our tax paying stockholders may benefit to the degree they can take advantage of the lower tax rate on capital gains versus ordinary income 
total taxable income and taxable income per share were higher in than in and higher in than in the primary reason for these higher levels was due to increases in our equity employed plus an increase in gains from calls and sales

financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources review of assets and operations by portfolio each of our product lines and portfolios is a component of our single business of investing in  credit enhancing  and securitizing residential and commercial real estate loans and securities 
our earning assets  as presented for gaap purposes  consist of five portfolios residential real estate loans  
table of contents helocs  residential ces  commercial real estate loans  and securities portfolio 
a discussion of the activities and trends in each of these portfolios appears below 
residential real estate loans our consolidated residential real estate loan portfolio includes all of the residential loans that we own temporarily as inventory prior to sale to a securitization plus loans that are consolidated onto our balance sheet from abs securitization entities that have been sponsored by us 
residential loans that are structured as helocs are detailed in a separate section below 
our consolidated residential real estate loan portfolio consists of prime quality residential loans that generally have high quality characteristics such as relatively low loan to value ratios and borrowers with relatively high credit scores in each case relative to the us residential real estate loans as a whole 
the majority of these loans are jumbo loans that had loan balances at origination that exceeded the loan limits imposed on fannie mae and freddie mac  so they were not eligible at origination for purchase for credit enhancement by these government sponsored enterprises 
at december   redwood owned million of residential real estate loans as inventory under accumulation for sale to future securitizations and million for sale to third parties 
these loans were pledged to support million of associated redwood debt 
abs securitization entities consolidated on redwood s balance sheet owned billion of residential real estate loans as of december  total residential real estate loans shown on our consolidated balance sheets at december  were billion 
there were approximately  loans in the consolidated residential real estate loan portfolio at december   and the average loan balance was  loans with a balance over million made up of the dollar balance of loans 
over of consolidated residential loans at december  had adjustable rate coupons that adjust every month or each six months to the one or six month libor rate a short term interest rate 
loans on homes located in california were of the dollar balance of this portfolio  split almost evenly between northern and southern california 
other states that each represent to of our consolidated portfolio include florida  georgia  new york  new jersey  texas  arizona  and colorado 
we acquired billion of high quality residential real estate loans as securitization inventory during most of these loans were subsequently sold to abs securitization entities that we consolidate for reporting purposes 
all of our loan purchases were one and six month libor loans 
we continue to expand our relationships with originators from whom we acquire loans 
in addition  adjustable rate loans remained popular among homeowners 
as a result  our acquisition volumes remained strong during despite a decrease in residential loan origination overall 
acquisition volumes declined in the fourth quarter 
if interest rates rise and or the yield curve flattens further  or the housing market weakens  or competition to acquire loans further increases  or competing negative amortization arms continue to gain shares of the jumbo arm market  we would expect our volume of adjustable rate residential loan acquisitions to continue to decline 
the reserve for credit losses on our residential real estate loans is included as a component of our residential real estate loans on our consolidated balance sheets 
our residential real estate loan reserve balance was of the current balance of this portfolio as of both december  and during   and  the provision for credit losses for residential real estate loans recorded on our consolidated statements of income was million  million  and million  respectively 
charge offs recorded in this portfolio totaled million  million  and million during   and  respectively  and  remained at an annualized rate of less than basis point during these periods 
serious delinquencies increased from million at december  to million at december  delinquencies include loans delinquent more than days  in bankruptcy  in foreclosure  and real estate owned 
as a percentage of our loan portfolio  delinquencies remained at low levels relative to the us residential real estate loans as a whole  and were of our current loan balances in this portfolio at december  the credit quality of these loans  personal income growth  a strong housing market  and rising housing prices have helped to contain and reduce delinquencies and losses 
recently  however  short term 
table of contents interest rates have started to rise 
if this trend continues  required monthly payments made by homeowners with adjustable rate real estate loans could increase by a material amount  thus potentially causing some credit issues 
almost all of the loans in our consolidated residential real estate loan portfolio are adjustable rate 
rising interest rates or a soft economy could also have an impact on housing prices  which in turn could adversely affect our delinquencies and losses 
as of december   substantially all of the loans in this portfolio are interest only loans for several years from origination  the homeowner is able to make interest payments only rather than both principal and interest and none of the loans in this portfolio have the potential for negative amortization for several years from origination  the homeowner can opt to make a payment that is less than the full interest accrual rate on the loan  so the total loan balance can increase 
although loans are generally high quality loans with credit scores  loan to value ratios  and other loan characteristics consistent with high quality  the ability of the homeowner to make a payment less than the amount that would fully amortize the loan may cause additional risks especially as interest rates rise  as these are adjustable rate loans 
over the last ten years  the credit performance of the interest only and negative amortization residential loans that redwood has credit enhanced has been excellent 
table consolidated residential real estate loans interest income and yield dollars in thousands year ended december  interest income net premium amortization expense credit provision expense total interest income average consolidated residential real estate loans yields as a result of interest income net premium amortization expense credit provision expense yield during  interest income on residential real estate loans increased as a result of higher average balances and higher yields as short term interest rates rose 
yields on these residential real estate loans have started to trend upward as most of these loans have coupon rates that adjust monthly or every six months as a function of the one or six month libor short term interest rate 
because of the rising interest rate environment during and the effect it had on projected yields over the lives of these loans  premium amortization expense as a percent of average loan balances during decreased from prior periods 
amortization expense results from elections we have made under sfas pursuant to which we determine an effective yield to amortize the premium using coupon interest rates as they change over time and anticipated principal prepayments actual and projected for loans acquired prior to july  thus  rising rates on an adjustable rate loan may result in a higher effective yield ie  a lower rate of premium amortization over the remaining life of the loan all other factors being equal 
for loans acquired after july   we determine an effective yield under sfas using the initial coupon interest rate of the loans without regard to future changes in the underlying indices and anticipated prepayment rates 
for these portfolios  changing coupon interest rates will not affect the periodic 
table of contents premium amortization expense all other factors being equal 
interest income will continue to vary according to the coupon rates on the loans and be affected by the level of principal prepayments 
during the course of reviewing the application of sfas for the third quarter of  we realized that there were several provisions of that standard that we had been applying inappropriately 
the impact of this error was that  on a cumulative basis  we had accelerated loan acquisition premium amortization by million 
under the provisions of apb reporting accounting changes and sab materiality  we analyzed the impact of the error on each period affected 
after carefully assessing the effect of this error on previously reported earnings and the effect of recording a cumulative correcting adjustment of million in the third quarter  we determined that the error was not material to previously issued financial statements or to the financial statements for the nine months ended september  and the year ended december  accordingly  a cumulative correcting adjustment of million was recorded and resulted in a decrease in loan acquisition premium amortization and an increase in net income on our consolidated statements of income and an increase in the residential real estate loan balance on our consolidated balance sheets 
the correction of this error did not have an impact on reported cash flow from operations  did not affect reported taxable income  and did not affect our dividend distributions 
residential home equity lines of credit helocs in the second quarter of  we acquired million of high quality helocs and sold them to a securitization entity sponsored by us 
the current balance of the heloc loans at december  was million 
this heloc portfolio consists of adjustable rate first and second lien residential loans with a year revolving period and a maturity from origination of years 
during the revolving period  borrowers have the option of drawing funds up to the available credit limit 
as a result  the balance of each loan  and the total balance of this portfolio  may increase if borrowers increase their draws 
the coupon rate on the helocs adjusts as a function of the prime short term interest rate 
the heloc portfolio is generally high quality and characterized by relatively high fico credit scores average of and relatively low combined loan to value ratios average of 
the borrowers in this heloc portfolio are similar in many ways to the borrowers for the other residential loans in the securitizations we have sponsored 
in general  due to the second lien status of most of these helocs  we expect delinquencies for these helocs to be somewhat higher than we experience with our other managed real estate loans 
we believe the loss frequency of these helocs may be approximately similar to the other residential loans of the same vintage that we manage  but we expect the loss severity credit loss from a default  as a percentage of the loan balance of helocs to be significantly higher 
due to the higher loss severity  we expect cumulative credit losses over time on these helocs could be materially higher than on our other managed residential loans 
we have factored this higher loss expectation into our acquisition pricing and securitization calculations 
as a result  we believe these securitized helocs can produce significantly higher losses than our other managed residential loans 
we currently intend to continue acquiring and securitizing these loans when we believe we can acquire helocs at a price that is less than the net sales proceeds we would expect to earn from sponsoring a securitization of these loans 
in the second half of and the first months of  the price banks were willing to pay for these loans for their own portfolios exceeded the price we were willing to pay based on our estimate of the proceeds available from the securitization of these loans 
our gaap credit reserve for consolidated helocs was million  or of the current balance of this portfolio  as of december  delinquencies in our heloc portfolio totaled million  or of the outstanding balance  as of december  there were no realized credit losses from the heloc portfolio during

by bearing the first loss and second loss credit risk  these securities credit enhance the other securities issued by the abs entity  allowing those securities to earn high ratings from credit rating agencies  thus allowing them to be sold to a wide variety of capital markets investors 
the ces that bear the concentrated credit risk typically have below investment grade credit ratings 
the maximum loss for the owner of these securities  however  is limited to the investment made in purchasing the ces 
we acquire residential ces at a price that is typically significantly less than the principal value of the security our investment is typically to of principal value for a first loss security 
initial cash on cash interest rate returns can be favorable  as the security typically pays interest at a rate of to of principal value  yet we acquire these securities at a significant discount to principal value 
if cumulative credit losses in the underlying pool of loans exceed the principal value of the first loss piece  we will never receive a principal payment from that security 
our investment returns could nevertheless be favorable  given the high rate of initial cash on cash return 
thus  the timing of future credit losses is as important as the amount of future credit losses the longer losses are delayed  the better our economic returns 
at december   we reported for gaap purposes ownership of residential ces acquired from securitizations sponsored by others with a market value totaling million 
these securities had a principal value of million  an increase from the million principal value we reported on december  at december   our adjusted cost basis of reported residential ces acquired from securitizations sponsored by others was million

at december  the market value of our ces was million  our adjusted cost basis was million  and net unrealized market value gains were million 
of the million difference between the principal value and adjusted cost basis of these residential loan ces at december   we designated million as internal credit protection reflecting our estimate of likely credit losses on the underlying loans over the life of these securities  with the remaining million representing a purchase discount we are accruing into income over time 
during the year ended december   we re designated million of designated credit protection to unamortized discount to be accrued into income over time due to strong credit performance and rapid prepayments on the underlying loans 
at december   there was a million difference between principal value and adjusted cost basis  of which million was designated an internal credit protection and million was unamortized purchase discount 
during  we re designated million from designated credit protection to unamortized discount 
at december   we had million of external credit enhancement and million of internally designated credit protection for this portfolio 
external credit protection serves to protect us from credit losses on a specific asset basis and represents the principal value of interests that are junior to us and are owned by others 
the combined balance of external and internally designated credit protection represented basis points of the billion of loans underlying our credit enhancement portfolio 
the amount of credit protection and the related risks are specific to each credit enhancement interest 
at december   we had million of internally designated credit protection and million of externally designated credit protection for this portfolio

the total managed loans underlying these reported residential loan ces increased from billion on december  to billion on december  residential loan ces become callable as they season  usually when the current balance of the underlying loans declines to under of the original securitized loan balance 
calls are usually beneficial for us in the near term  as we receive a payment for the full principal value of an asset that  in general  we acquired at a discount to the principal value 
calls typically diminish on going earnings per share  however  as it is usually our highest yielding assets that get called

we typically use debt to fund the accumulation of inventory assets prior to sale to abs securitization entities primarily sequoia and acacia entities 
these inventory assets are pledged to secure the associated debt 
our debt levels vary from quarter to quarter based on the timing of our asset accumulation and securitization activities 
we believe our debt balances are most likely to remain between and billion 
in  as measured daily  our maximum debt level was billion  our minimum debt level was million  and our average debt level was million 
overall  we believe we maintain a close match between the interest rate characteristics of redwood debt and the associated assets 
for most of our debt funded assets securitization inventory  the floating rate nature of our debt closely matches the adjustable rate interest income earning characteristics of the inventory assets 
not all of the inventory assets we acquire are adjustable rate 
we also acquire fixed rate and hybrid fixed adjustable securities for re securitization via our acacia cdo program  and we may acquire hybrid fixed adjustable rate residential real estate loans in the future for our sequoia securitization program 
when we accumulate assets as inventory for future securitizations that do not match the interest rate characteristics of our debt  we typically use interest rate agreements to hedge associated interest rate mismatches 
we currently intend to utilize a collateralized commercial paper issuance facility for a portion of our redwood debt during  although this facility is not yet in place 

table of contents asset backed securities issued at december   redwood consolidated on its balance sheet billion of asset backed securities that are obligations of those securitization entities that were sponsored by redwood and in which redwood purchased one or more abs interests for its permanent asset portfolio 
these asset backed securities are not obligations of redwood 
acacia entities issue abs of a type known as cdo to fund their acquisition of real estate securities from the securitization inventory held by redwood 
acacia cdo issuance outstanding was billion as of december  and billion as of december  issuance was approximately million during  million during  and million during sequoia entities issue asset backed securities to finance the purchase of residential real estate loans held as securitization inventory by redwood 
sequoia had billion of asset backed securities outstanding at december  compared to billion at december  during   and  sequoia entities issued approximately billion  billion  and billion of newly created asset backed securities  respectively 
stockholders equity our stockholders equity increased  from million at december  to million at december  as a result of million earnings  million stock issuance  proceeds from stock option exercises  and non cash equity adjustments  and a million net increase in the market values of certain assets that are marked to market through our consolidated balance sheets  offset by million dividends declared 
depending on our investment portfolio and securitization activity growth  and also on asset sales and capital recycling opportunities  we may seek to raise additional equity capital during we issue equity shares if we believe that opportunities to expand our portfolios are attractive and we believe such issuance would likely enhance long term earnings and dividends per share  compared to what they would be otherwise 
in general  we usually seek to maintain a level of excess equity capital sufficient to fund to months of anticipated growth 

table of contents cash requirements and sources of cash we require cash to fund our operating and securitization activities  invest in earning assets  service and repay redwood debt  fund working capital  and fund our dividend distributions 
one primary source of cash is principal and interest payments received on a monthly basis from our real estate portfolio assets 
this includes payments received from those abs that redwood owns that it acquired from the redwood sponsored abs securitizations that are reported on its consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  redwood uses as a source of cash proceeds from sales of inventory assets to securitizations entities  proceeds from sales of other assets  redwood debt  retained earnings  and issuance of common stock 
we currently use borrowings solely to finance the acquisition of inventory for sale to securitization entities 
sources of borrowings for redwood include repurchase agreements  bank borrowings  and other forms of collateralized short term borrowings 
we currently intend to also utilize a collateralized commercial paper facility during these borrowings are typically repaid using proceeds received from the sale of inventory assets to securitization entities 
for residential loans  our typical inventory holding period is one to four weeks 
for securities held for sale to acacia cdo securitization entities  our typical inventory holding period is one to four months 
in addition to the cash flows discussed above  our consolidated statements of cash flows also includes cash flows generated and used by the abs securitization entities that are consolidated on to our reported balance sheet 
cash flows generated within these entities are not available to redwood  except to the degree that a portion of these cash flows may be due to redwood as an owner of one or more of the abs certificates issued by the entity 
cash flow obligations of and uses of cash by these abs entities are not part of redwood s operations and are not obligations of redwood  although a decrease in net cash flow or an increase in credit losses generated by an abs entity could defer or reduce or potentially eliminate interest and or principal payments otherwise due to redwood as an owner of certain more risky abs issued by the entity 
off balance sheet commitments at december   in the ordinary course of business  we had commitments to purchase million of real estate loans and securities that settled in january these purchase commitments represent derivative instruments under sfas no 
the value of these commitments was negligible as of december  contractual obligations and commitments the table below presents our contractual obligations and commitments as of december   as well as the consolidated obligations of the securitization entities that we sponsored from which we have acquired securities for our portfolio 
the reported obligations appear on our consolidated balance sheets 
the operating leases are commitments that are expensed based on the terms of the related contracts 
additional information on these obligations is presented in our notes to consolidated financial statements

market risks we seek to manage the risks inherent in our business including credit risk  liquidity risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  market value risk  reinvestment risk  and capital risk in a prudent manner designed to insure redwood s longevity 
at the same time  we endeavor  to the best of our ability  to provide our stockholders with both a steady regular dividend and an attractive long term return 
in general  we seek to assume risks that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risks  to earn sufficient compensation to justify the taking of such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we do take 
credit risk assuming the credit risk of real estate loans is our primary business 
we are highly leveraged in an economic sense due to the structured leverage with the securities we own  as the amount of residential and commercial real estate loans on which we take first loss risk is high relative to our equity capital base 
however  our maximum credit loss from our permanent asset portfolio excluding loans and securities held temporarily as inventory for securitization is limited and is less than our equity capital base 
the majority of our credit risk comes from high quality residential real estate loans 
this includes residential real estate loans consolidated from abs securitizations from which we have acquired a credit sensitive abs security  and loans we effectively guarantee or insure through the acquisitions of residential loan ces from securitizations sponsored by others 
we are also exposed to credit risks in our commercial real estate loan portfolio  our residential and commercial real estate securities portfolio  and with counter parties with whom we do business 
the method that we use to account for future credit losses depends upon the type of asset that we own 
for our consolidated residential real estate loans  we establish a credit reserve based on an estimate of 
table of contents credit losses by taking credit provisions through our consolidated statements of income 
for our residential loan ces  we designate a portion of the purchased discount as a credit reserve upon the acquisition of such assets 
in addition  first loss and other credit enhancement interests that we do not own that are junior to our positions act as a form of external credit protection for us on a specific asset basis for some of our assets  these interests junior to ours absorb credit losses in specific pools of underlying real estate loans before our interest in that pool of loans will experience losses 
for our commercial real estate loans  we establish a credit reserve or mark the loan to its estimated realizable value which would incorporate any likely credit losses 
many of the assets in the securities portfolio benefit from material forms of external credit enhancement and thus no credit reserves have been established to date for these assets 
unrealized market value losses on these securities are reported as a component of net recognized gains losses and valuation adjustments in our consolidated statements of income if the decline in value is considered under fas and eitf to represent a permanent impairment 
see critical accounting policies above 
the establishment of a credit reserve for loans and our credit loss assumptions for securities to calculate long term yields under the effective yield method under gaap accounting does not reduce our taxable income or our dividend payment obligations as a reit 
for taxable income  many of our credit expenses will be recognized only as the underlying loans are charged off 
thus  the timing and recognition of credit losses for gaap and tax purposes  and for our earnings and our dividends  may differ 
an increase in realized credit losses may not affect our gaap income due to our anticipation of such losses and our credit reserves 
they could  however  materially reduce our reit taxable income and  therefore  our dividend payment obligations 
conversely  our dividend payment obligations may remain high even during periods when future credit losses are expected but have not yet been realized 
liquidity risk redwood s debt was million at december  this debt was secured by assets accumulated as inventory for future sale to sequoia and acacia bankruptcy remote abs securitization entities 
the assets securing this debt were high quality residential real estate loans and mostly investment grade real estate loan securities 
the on going securitization part of our business depends upon being able to access the short term debt markets to fund assets acquired as inventory prior to sale to abs securitizations 
if short term debt was not available in the future  we would likely need to cease our securitization activities  and a potentially attractive source of new assets for our permanent assets portfolio and a source of gain on sale profits for tax and cash for our taxable subsidiaries would be lost during that time 
assets consolidated on to our balance sheet from abs entities would not be affected by a lack of liquidity in the debt markets or changes in asset market values since these assets are already sold to and financed to maturity by the abs entity 
if sales to abs entities became an unavailable or unattractive exit strategy due to issues within securitization markets  and if we cannot extend our short term financing arrangements  assets held as inventory for future securitization and financed with debt would have to be sold  most likely at a loss 
proceeds from any such sales may not be sufficient to repay debt balances 
at this time  we see no material negative trends that we believe would affect our access to sufficient short term borrowings or would affect the valuation of the assets we use to secure these borrowings 
we plan to continue to utilize short term borrowings to accumulate real estate loans and securities as inventory prior to sale to abs entities 
we own abs certificates issued from abs securitization entities such as sequoia and acacia that were sponsored by us 
payments of principal and interest by these entities to the holders of asset backed securities issued by these trusts are not the legal obligation of redwood 
we could lose the entire investment we have made in the securities we acquire from these entities  but we will not be required to provide liquidity in the event of a default of one of these entities on the entities obligations 
as the seller of assets to these entities prior to securitization  in some cases we have the obligation under representation and warranty provisions to repurchase assets from the entities in limited circumstances such as fraud 
we have obtained  however  similar representations and warranties from the companies 
table of contents from whom we acquired loans 
as a result  our liquidity risk from representations and warranties should be minimal as long as our counter parties meet their obligations 
we believe our sponsorship of these entities  and our ownership of interests in these entities  is unlikely to be a source of potential liquidity risk for us 
at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and unpledged investment grade securities available to meet potential liquidity needs 
thus  total available liquidity equaled of our short term debt balances 
increases or decreases in this ratio at different balance sheet dates primarily are the result of the timing of sale of assets to securitization entities 
while we anticipate maintaining a strong liquidity position  our ratio of these assets to short term debt will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as we continue to fund our residential real estate loans and other securities with short term borrowings prior to securitization 
at this time  we see no indications or materially negative trends that we believe would be likely to cause us a liquidity shortage 
net liquidity at december  was million 
net liquidity is the amount of unrestricted cash we would have had on hand if we had sold all the loans and securities we are accumulating as inventory for securitization at their estimated market value million on december  and used the proceeds to pay off redwood s debt million on december  
net liquidity is available for cash needs such as dividend distributions  acquiring new permanent assets and supporting our securitization efforts 
under our internal risk adjusted capital guidelines  million of this net liquidity at december  was excess liquidity available to support growth in our business 
the remainder of the net liquidity balance was required under our risk adjusted capital guidelines to support our current and projected securitization inventory and other operating needs and liquidity risks such as the risk of requiring cash to post as margin for interest rate agreements if interest rates move adversely for these agreements 
covenants associated with a portion of our short term debt generally relate to our tangible net worth  liquidity reserves  and leverage requirements 
we have not had  nor do we currently anticipate having  any problems in meeting these covenants 
however  many factors  including ones external to us  may affect our ability to meet these covenants and may affect our liquidity in the future 
interest rate risk our strategy is to maintain an asset liability posture on a consolidated basis including assets owned by and the abs issued by consolidated securitization entities  to the extent that any mismatches within the entities could affect our cash flows that is effectively match funded so that the achievement of our long term goals is unlikely to be affected by changes in interest rates 
in general  the interest rate characteristics of the abs issued by consolidated securitization entities  as adjusted for outstanding interest rate agreements  closely matches the interest rate characteristics of the assets owned by those entities 
at december   we consolidated as abs obligations billion of outstanding adjustable rate abs collateralized by adjustable rate assets and billion of fixed hybrid rate abs funding consolidated fixed hybrid rate assets 
for interest rate matching purposes  these assets and liabilities are closely matched 
at december   we owned the io security  cdo equity  or similar security that economically benefits from the spread between the assets and the liabilities of the issuing securitization entity on a portion of consolidated abs assets 
these assets and liabilities are closely matched economically and to the degree there is a mismatch we attempt to reduce this mismatch through the use of interest rate agreements 
for the remainder of the consolidated abs assets  we do not own the security that benefits from the asset liability spread 
spread changes between the yield of these assets and the cost of these liabilities do not affect redwood s economic profits or cash flow 
as a result  we do not utilize interest rate agreements with respect to any interest rate mismatches that may exist between these assets and liabilities 
the remainder of our consolidated assets million of six month adjustable rate assets  million of short term fixed rate assets of million hybrid and fixed rate assets  and million non earning assets were effectively funded for interest rate matching purposes with equity 
the table below summarizes the matching of our assets  as adjusted for our interest rate agreements and other hedging instruments 

table of contents table asset liability matching at december  dollars in millions one six one non total month month year fixed interest liabilities asset asset libor libor treasury hybrid bearing and type amount liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities equity equity cash unrestricted one month libor six month libor other arm fixed hybrid yr fixed hybrid yr non earning assets total projected principal receipts on fixed rate and hybrid rate assets over the next twelve months 
table asset liability matching at december  dollars in millions one six one non total month month year fixed interest liabilities asset asset libor libor treasury hybrid bearing and type amount liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities equity equity cash unrestricted one month libor six month libor other arm fixed hybrid yr fixed hybrid yr non earning assets total prepayment risk we seek to maintain an asset liability posture that benefits from investments in prepayment sensitive assets while limiting the risk of adverse prepayment fluctuations to an amount that  in most circumstances  can be absorbed by our capital base while still allowing us to make regular dividend payments 
we believe there is a relatively low likelihood of prepayment risk events occurring within our securitization inventory assets  as we typically sell these loans within a few months of acquiring them 
however  changes in prepayment forecasts by market participants could affect the market prices for abs securities especially io securities sold by these securitization entities  and thus could affect the gain on sale for economics and tax purposes  not for gaap purposes that we seek to earn from sponsoring these securitizations 

table of contents with respect to other assets  there could be prepayment risks that arise due to the interaction of these assets and associated liabilities 
prepayment rates can affect our earnings for economic  tax  and gaap purposes from these assets 
in general  discount securities such as ces benefit from faster prepayment rates for the underlying real estate loans and premium securities such as io securities benefit from slower prepayments for the underlying loans 
our largest potential exposure to changes in prepayment rates is for short term residential arm loans 
at the beginning of  our premium io securities backed by these loans materially exceeded our discount ces backed by these loans 
at that time  we benefited economically if arm loan prepayments were slow 
during  however  we acquired few arm io securities while acquiring a large volume of arm ces 
as a result  we believe that as of december  any increase in returns on ces we own that are backed by adjustable rate loans would likely offset and may exceed the concurrent reduction in returns over the long term that we would earn from io securities we own that are backed by adjustable rate loans 
however  the timing of the recognition of these generally offsetting returns would likely not match as residential ces are longer lived securities and the recognition of higher returns from faster arm prepayments may occur at a subsequent point in time 
arm prepayment rates are driven by many factors  one of which is the steepness of the yield curve 
as the yield curve flattens short term interest rates rise relative to longer term interest rates  arm prepayments typically increase 
prepayment rates on the arms underlying the redwood sponsored sequoia securitizations increased from near to near over the last months through february as the yield curve flattened 
through our ownership of discount residential ces backed by fixed rate and hybrid residential loans  we generally benefit from faster prepayments on fixed and hybrid loans 
prepayment rates for these loans typically accelerate as medium and long term interest rates decline 
prepayments can also affect our credit results and risks 
credit risks for the ces we own are reduced each time a loan prepays 
all other factors being equal  faster prepayment rates should reduce our credit risks 
as discussed in the next section  faster prepayment rates can lead to higher levels of reinvestment risk 
although many of our securities do not currently receive principal payments as the underlying loan pools pay down they are temporarily locked out  the eventual receipt of principal payments will be accelerated by faster prepayments 
in addition  residential ces typically become callable when the current balance of the underlying loans pays down to of the original balance 
faster prepayments generally lead to more rapid principal repayments and calls that will need to be reinvested 
prepayments affect gaap earnings in the near term primarily through amortization of purchase premium and discount 
amortization income from discount assets may not necessarily offset amortization expenses from premium assets  and vice versa 
variations in current and projected prepayment rates for individual assets and changes in short term interest rates as they affect projected coupons on adjustable rate mortgages  and thus change effective yield calculations may cause net premium amortization expense or net discount amortization income to vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
prepayment trends in recent years slow prepayments on adjustable rate loans and fast prepayments on fixed rate and hybrid loans have been highly favorable for generating economic returns from our existing consolidated assets 
in general  higher long term interest rates leading to slower fixed rate loan prepayments are less favorable for current economic returns from our existing assets 
over the last year  and continuing into  fixed rate loan prepayments have slowed 
reinvestment risk and competition reinvestment risk is the risk that the assets we acquire in the future to maintain our asset size as we reinvest principal payments received from our current assets will not be as attractive as the assets we own today 
this is one of the most potent risks we face today 

table of contents most of our assets have an expected average life of three to ten years 
as a result  our short term results one to three years will likely be determined primarily by our current portfolio of assets 
our longer term results and our ability to maintain regular dividend payments in the long term will be determined primarily by assets we have yet to buy and actions we have yet to take 
during  we experienced increased competition especially from banks  but also from wall street conduits  reits  hedge funds  and other financial institutions to acquire assets at the same time that originations of new assets are declining 
we expect this increased level of competition to continue 
the result is lower expected yields for new investment assets and lower expected securitization margins for assets acquired as securitization inventory 
as a result  we expect that our reported gaap earnings per share and our special dividends per share are likely to decline over the next few years as our current portfolio pays down and is replaced with new assets with a lower yield potential 
market value risk at december   we reported on a consolidated basis billion of assets that were marked to market through our balance sheet but not through our income statement 
of these assets  had adjustable rate coupons  were hybrid loans  and the remaining had fixed interest rates 
market value fluctuations of these assets can affect the balance of our stockholders equity base 
at december   we reported on a consolidated basis real estate loans totaling million that we account for on a lower of cost or market basis for purposes of determining earnings 
all of these assets had adjustable rate coupons 
market value fluctuations for these assets can affect our reported earnings 
in addition  market value declines for a large volume of our assets could affect our reported earnings through sfas or eitf write downs 
market value fluctuations for our assets can affect not only our earnings and book value  but also our liquidity  especially to the extent these assets may be funded with short term borrowings prior to securitization 
most of our real estate assets are loans accounted for as held for investment and reported at cost 
as these loans are generally sold to sequoia at securitization  changes in the market value of the loans do not have an impact on our liquidity 
we use interest rate agreements to manage certain interest rate risks 
please see our discussion above under interest rate risk and in our notes to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of our interest rate agreements 
our interest rate agreements are reported at market value  with any periodic changes reported through either our income statement or in our balance sheet 
adverse changes in the market values of our interest rate agreements which would generally be caused by falling interest rates may require us to devote additional amounts of cash to margin calls 
inflation risk virtually all of our consolidated assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates  changes in interest rates  and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and  as a reit  our dividends must equal at least of our net reit taxable income as calculated for tax purposes 
in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide a discussion about market risks in item of this annual report on form k 
to supplement these discussions  the table below incorporates information that may be useful in analyzing certain market value risks on our consolidated balance sheets 
this table presents just one scenario regarding potential future principal prepayments and interest rates of our assets and liabilities  based on certain underlying assumptions 
there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur as anticipated 
future sales  principal repayments  acquisitions  calls  and restructuring could materially change our interest rate risk profile 

table of contents for our interest rate sensitive assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of repayment 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of debt markets as of december  was used to project the average coupon rates for each year presented  based on the existing characteristics of our portfolio 
the timing of principal cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of these assets based on their recent prepayment performance and future prepayment performance consistent with this interest rate scenario 
actual prepayment speeds will likely vary significantly from these assumptions 
furthermore  this table does not include anticipated credit losses and assumes all of the principal we are entitled to receive will be received 
the actual amount and timing of credit losses will affect the principal payments and effective rates during all periods 
as discussed throughout this annual report on form k  our future earnings are sensitive to a number of factors and changes in these factors may have a variety of secondary effects that  in turn  will also impact our earnings 
in addition  one of the key factors in projecting our income is the reinvestment rate on new assets and there is no reinvestment assumed in this table 
the information provided in this table is based on our existing portfolio at december  under one set of assumptions
