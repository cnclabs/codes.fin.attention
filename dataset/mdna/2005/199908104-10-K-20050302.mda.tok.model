item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations later in this report 
chillers for large units typically have the longest delivery time and generally have lead times of up to six months 
the major components of commercial hvac systems are compressors and chillers that are manufactured primarily by york  carrier  trane and lennox 
the major suppliers of building automation control systems are honeywell  johnson controls  siemens  york  automated logic  novar and andover control corporation 
we do not have any significant contracts guaranteeing us a supply of raw materials or components 
we administer a portion of our procurement activities with emcor group  a larger publicly held provider of electrical and mechanical services and facilities management 
this coordination includes contractual arrangements with emcor under which certain emcor employees provide procurement management services to us 
sales and marketing we have a diverse customer base  with no single customer accounting for more than of consolidated revenues 
management and a dedicated sales force are responsible for developing and maintaining successful long term relationships with key customers 
customers generally include building owners and developers and property managers  as well as general contractors  architects and consulting engineers 
we intend to continue our emphasis on developing and maintaining long term relationships with our customers by providing superior  high quality service in a professional manner 
we believe we can continue to leverage the diverse technical and marketing strengths at individual locations to expand the services offered in other local markets 
with respect to multi location service opportunities  we maintain a national sales force in our national accounts group 
employees as of december   we had  employees 
we have collective bargaining agreements covering approximately employees 
we have not experienced and do not expect any significant strikes or work stoppages and believe our relations with employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are good 
recruiting  training and safety our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified engineers  service technicians  field supervisors and project managers 
we believe our success in retaining qualified employees will be based on the quality of our recruiting  training  compensation  employee benefits programs and opportunities for advancement 
we provide on the job training  technical training  apprenticeship programs  attractive benefit packages and career advancement opportunities within our company 
we have established comprehensive safety programs throughout our operations to ensure that all technicians comply with safety standards we have established and that are established under federal  state and local laws and regulations 
additionally  we have implemented a best practices safety program throughout our operations  which provides employees with incentives to improve safety performance and decrease workplace accidents 
regional safety directors establish safety programs and benchmarking to improve safety within their region 
finally  our employment screening process seeks to determine that prospective employees have requisite skills  sufficient background references and acceptable driving records  if applicable 
our rate of incidents recordable under the standards of the occupational safety and health administration per employees per year  also known as the osha recordable rate  was during this level was better than the most recently published osha rate for our industry 
we have improved our osha recordable rate every year since we first began tracking it company wide six years ago 
risk management  insurance and litigation the primary risks in our operations are bodily injury  property damage and injured workers compensation 
we retain the risk for worker s compensation  employer s liability  auto liability  general liability and employee group health claims resulting from uninsured deductibles per incident or occurrence 
because we have very large deductibles  the vast majority of our claims are paid by us  so as a practical matter we self insure the great majority of these risks 
losses up to such per incident deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts  historical trends and industry averages utilizing the assistance of an actuary to project the extent of these obligations 
we are subject to certain claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business 
we maintain various insurance coverages to minimize financial risk associated with these claims 
we have estimated and provided accruals for probable losses and related legal fees associated with certain of our litigation in our consolidated financial statements 
the largest single unresolved matter to which we are a party involves a construction project 
if this matter were ultimately resolved on the least favorable terms to us  management estimates that we would incur a liability of approximately million 
however  management believes the likelihood of such a least favorable outcome is remote  and believes our asset balances and accruals relating to this matter appropriately reflect a probable outcome 
our remaining litigation involves matters with significantly smaller individual potential losses 
in management s opinion  uninsured losses resulting from the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 
we typically warrant labor for the first year after installation on new hvac systems and pass through to the customer manufacturers warranties on equipment 
we generally warrant labor for days after servicing of existing hvac systems 
we do not expect warranty claims to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
competition the hvac industry is highly competitive and consists of thousands of local and regional companies 
we believe that purchasing decisions in the commercial  industrial and institutional markets are based on i competitive price  ii long term customer relationships  iii quality  timeliness and reliability of services provided  iv an organization s perceived stability based on years in business  financial strength  and access to bonding  v range of services provided  and vi scale of operation 
to improve our competitive position we focus on both the consultative design and build installation market and the maintenance  repair and replacement market to promote first the development and then the strengthening of long term customer relationships 
in addition  we believe our ability to provide multi location coverage  access to project financing and specialized technical skills for facilities owners gives us a strategic advantage over smaller competitors who may be unable to provide these services to customers at a competitive price 
we believe that we are larger than most of our competitors  which are generally small  owner operated companies that typically operate in a limited geographic area 
however  there are divisions of larger contracting companies  utilities and hvac equipment manufacturers that provide hvac services in some of the same service lines and geographic areas we serve 
some of these competitors and potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do to finance development opportunities and support their operations 
we believe our smaller competitors generally compete with us based on price and their long term relationships with local customers 
our larger competitors compete with us on those factors but may also provide attractive financing and comprehensive service and product packages 
vehicles we operate a fleet of various owned or leased service trucks  vans and support vehicles 
we believe these vehicles generally are well maintained and sufficient for our current operations 
governmental regulation and environmental matters our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations  including i licensing requirements applicable to engineering  construction and service technicians  ii building and hvac codes and zoning ordinances  iii regulations relating to consumer protection  including those governing residential service agreements  and iv regulations relating to worker safety and protection of the environment 
we believe we have all required licenses to conduct our operations and are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses 
many state and local regulations governing the hvac services trades require individuals to hold permits and licenses 
in some cases  a required permit or license held by a single individual may be sufficient to authorize specified activities for all of our service technicians who work in the state or county that issued the permit or license 
we seek to ensure that  where possible  we have two employees who hold any such permits or licenses that may be material to our operations in a particular geographic region 
our operations are subject to the federal clean air act  as amended  which governs air emissions and imposes specific requirements on the use and handling of chlorofluorocarbons  or cfcs  and certain other refrigerants 
clean air act regulations require the certification of service technicians involved in the service or repair of equipment containing these refrigerants and also regulate the containment and recycling of these refrigerants 
these requirements have increased our training expenses and expenditures for containment and recycling equipment 
the clean air act is intended ultimately to eliminate the use of cfcs in the united states and to require alternative refrigerants to be used in replacement hvac systems 
we do not believe these regulations involving cfcs will materially affect our business on the whole because  although they require us to incur modest ongoing training costs  our competitors also incur such costs  and the regulations may encourage our customers to update their hvac systems

item properties we lease the real property and buildings from which we operate 
our facilities are located in over twenty five states and consist of offices  shops  maintenance and warehouse facilities 
generally  leases range from five to ten years and are on terms we believe to be commercially reasonable 
a majority of these premises are leased from individuals or entities with whom we have no other business relationship 
in certain instances these leases are with employees who are also the former owners of companies we purchased from through these leases were entered into in connection with the acquisition of the companies these individuals owned 
to the extent we renew these leases or otherwise change them  we enter into such agreements on terms that reflect a fair market valuation for the properties 
leased premises range in size from approximately  square feet to  square feet 
to maximize available capital  we generally intend to continue to lease our properties 
we believe that our facilities are sufficient for our current needs 
we lease our executive and administrative offices in houston  texas

also see forward looking statements discussion 
introduction and overview we are a national provider of comprehensive heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac installation  maintenance  repair and replacement services within the mechanical services industry 
the services we provide address a very broad need  as air is circulated through almost all commercial  industrial and institutional buildings virtually year round 
we operate primarily in the commercial  industrial and institutional hvac markets and perform most of our services within office buildings  retail centers  apartment complexes  manufacturing plants  and healthcare  education and government facilities 
in addition to standard hvac services  we provide specialized applications such as building automation control systems  fire protection  process cooling  electronic monitoring and process piping 
certain locations also perform related activities such as electrical service and plumbing 
nature and economics of our business approximately of our revenues are earned on a project basis for installation of hvac systems in newly constructed facilities or for replacement of hvac systems in existing facilities 
customers hire us to ensure such systems deliver specified or generally expected heating  cooling  conditioning and circulation of air in a facility 
this entails installing core system equipment such as packaged heating and air conditioning units  or in the case of larger facilities  separate core components such as chillers  boilers  air handlers  and cooling towers 
we also typically install connecting and distribution elements such as piping and ducting 
our responsibilities usually require conforming the systems to pre established engineering drawings and equipment and performance specifications  which we frequently participate in establishing 
our project management responsibilities include staging equipment and materials to project sites  deploying labor to perform the work  and coordinating with other service providers on the project  including any subcontractors we might use to deliver our portion of the work 
when competing for project business  we usually estimate the costs we will incur on a project  then propose a bid to the customer that includes a contract price and other performance and payment terms 
our bid price and terms are intended to cover our estimated costs on the project and provide a profit margin to us commensurate with the value of the installed system to the customer  the risk that project costs or duration will vary from estimate  the schedule on which we will be paid  the opportunities for other work that we might forego by committing capacity to this project  and other costs that we incur more broadly to support our operations but which are not specific to the project 
typically customers will seek bids from competitors for a given project 
while the criteria on which customers select the winning bid vary widely and include factors such as quality  technical expertise  on time performance  post project support and service  and company history and financial strength  we believe that price is the most influential factor for most customers in choosing an hvac installation and service provider 
after a customer accepts our bid  we generally enter into a contract with the customer that specifies what we will deliver on the project  what our related responsibilities are  and how much and when we will be paid 
our overall price for the project is typically set at a fixed amount in the contract  although changes in project specifications or work conditions that result in unexpected additional work are usually subject to additional payment from the customer via what are commonly known as change orders 
project contracts typically provide for periodic billings to the customer as we meet progress milestones or incur cost on the project 
project contracts in our industry also frequently allow for a small portion of progress billings or contract price to be withheld by the customer until after we have completed the work  typically for six months 
amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage 
labor and overhead costs account for the majority of our cost of service 
accordingly  labor management and utilization have the most impact on our project performance 
given the fixed price nature of much of our project work  if our initial estimate of project costs is wrong or we incur cost overruns that cannot be recovered in change orders  we can experience reduced profits or even significant losses on fixed price project work 
we also perform some project work on a cost plus or a time and materials basis  under which we are paid our costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit margin 
these margins are typically less than fixed price contract margins because there is less risk of unrecoverable cost overruns in cost plus or time and materials work 
as of december   we had  projects in process 
our average project takes three to six months to complete  with an average contract price of approximately  our projects generally require working capital funding of equipment and labor costs 
customer payments on periodic billings generally do not recover these costs until late in the job 
our average project duration together with typical retention terms as discussed above generally allow us to complete the realization of revenue and earnings in cash within one year 
because of the integral nature of hvac and related controls systems to most buildings  we have the legal right in almost all cases to attach liens to buildings or related funding sources when we have not been fully paid for installing systems  except with respect to some government buildings 
the service work that we do  which is discussed further below  usually does not give rise to lien rights 
we also perform larger hvac projects 
as of december   we had two projects in process with a contract price of between and million  six projects between million and million  projects between million and million  and projects between million and million 
taken together  projects with contract prices of million or more totaled million of aggregate contract value as of december   or approximately  out of a total contract value for all projects in progress of  million 
generally  projects closer in size to million will be completed in one year or less 
it is unusual for us to work on a project that exceeds two years in length 
in addition to project work  approximately of our revenues represent maintenance and repair service on already installed hvac and controls systems 
this kind of work usually takes from a few hours to a few days to perform 
prices to the customer are usually based on the equipment and materials used in the service as well as technician labor time 
we usually bill the customer for service work when it is complete  typically with payment terms of up to thirty days 
we also provide maintenance and repair service under ongoing contracts 
under these contracts  we are paid regular monthly or quarterly amounts and provide specified service based on customer requirements 
these agreements typically cover periods ranging from one to three years and are cancelable on to days notice 
a relatively small but growing portion of our revenues comes from national and regional account customers 
these customers typically have multiple sites  and contract with us to perform maintenance and repair service 
these contracts may also provide for us to perform new or replacement systems installation 
we operate a national call center to dispatch technicians to sites requiring service 
we perform the majority of this work with our own employees  with the balance being subcontracted to third parties that meet our performance qualifications 
we will also typically use proprietary information systems to maintain information on the customer s sites and equipment  including performance and service records  and related cost data 
these systems track the status of ongoing service and installation work  and may also monitor system performance data 
under these contractual relationships  we usually provide consolidated billing and credit payment terms to the customer 
profile and management of our operations our company was originally formed in through an initial public offering  or ipo  and simultaneous acquisition of companies engaged in our business 
from the time we completed our ipo through december  we acquired hvac and complementary businesses  of which were tuck in operations that were integrated upon acquisition with existing operations 
from through we did not acquire any additional companies but rather shifted our strategy from an emphasis on acquisition based growth to a focus on improving the performance of our existing operations 
during that time  we sold or ceased operations at companies and consolidated another companies into other operations 
in january we acquired a business in new england 
today we have operating units 
we manage our operations based on a variety of factors 
financial measures we emphasize include profitability  and use of capital as indicated by cash flow and by other measures of working capital principally involving project cost  billings and receivables 
we also monitor selling  general  administrative and indirect project support expense  backlog  workforce size and mix  growth in revenues and profits  variation of actual project cost from original estimate  and overall financial performance in comparison to budget and updated forecasts 
operational factors we emphasize include project selection  estimating  pricing  management and execution practices  labor utilization  safety  training  and the make up of both existing backlog as well as new business being pursued  in terms of project size  technical application and facility type  end use customers and industries  and location of the work 
most of our operations compete on a local or regional basis 
attracting and retaining effective operating unit managers is an important factor in our business  particularly in view of the relative uniqueness of each market and operation  the importance of relationships with customers and other market participants such as architects and consulting engineers  and the high degree of competition and low barriers to entry in most of our markets 
accordingly  we devote considerable attention to operating unit management quality  stability  and contingency planning  including related considerations of compensation  and non competition protection where applicable 
economic and industry factors as an hvac and building controls services provider  we operate in the broader nonresidential construction services industry and are affected by trends in this sector 
while we do not have operations in all major cities of the us  we believe our national presence is sufficiently large that we experience trends in demand for and pricing of our services that are consistent with trends in the national nonresidential construction sector 
as a result  we monitor the views of major construction sector forecasters along with macroeconomic factors they believe drive the sector  including trends in gross domestic product  interest rates  business investment  employment  demographics  and the general fiscal condition of federal  state and local governments 
although nonresidential construction activity has demonstrated periods of both significant growth and decline  it has grown at a compound annual rate of approximately over the last twenty five years 
spending decisions for building construction  renovation and system replacement are generally made on a project basis  usually with some degree of discretion as to when and if projects proceed 
with larger amounts of capital  time  and discretion involved  spending decisions are affected to a significant degree by uncertainty  particularly concerns about macroeconomic and geopolitical trends 
we have experienced periods of time  such as after the terrorist incidents on september  in the us  and prior to and during the war in iraq that occurred in early  when uncertainty caused a significant slowdown in decisions to proceed with installation and replacement project work 
most of the hvac equipment we install is provided by four large manufacturers 
we regularly seek the views of these manufacturers about trends in the commercial hvac sector 
we also evaluate hvac equipment shipment statistics reported monthly by the air conditioning and refrigeration institute  which is the principal industry organization of hvac equipment manufacturers 
we believe that many owners of installed hvac equipment have deferred maintenance and replacement activity during the very challenging economic conditions of the last several years 
we also believe that this trend will not continue indefinitely due to the fundamental mechanical nature and requirements of the equipment 
the large hvac manufacturers have each made public statements supporting this view 
however  there can be no assurance of whether or when we might actually experience increased demand for hvac service and replacement 
operating environment and management emphasis nonresidential building construction and renovation activity  as reported by the federal government  declined over the three year period of to in response to the broader us recession as well as uncertainty relating to international events 
this was a more extended period of contraction than the sector has experienced in other recent recessions  with particularly steep declines in the commercial and industrial portions of the industry 
as a result  like most nonresidential hvac service providers  we experienced decreasing volume  prices  and therefore gross profits during this period 
we responded to these market challenges by pursuing work in sectors less affected by this downturn  such as government  educational  and health care facilities  and by establishing marketing initiatives that take advantage of our size and range of expertise 
these initiatives include our regional and national multi location service efforts  our energy efficiency capabilities  and collaboration among our operating units to seek joint project opportunities 
as a result of these responses  the decreases we saw in revenues over the last three years have been less than the overall decline in activity experienced by the broader nonresidential sector 
we also responded to declining gross profits over recent years by reducing our selling  general  and administrative expenses  and our indirect project and service overhead costs 
we believe our efforts in these areas have partially offset the decline in our profitability over this period 
we began to see improvements in both industry activity as well as our own results in late and throughout  as discussed further under results of operations below 
in addition to addressing revenues and costs more broadly  we also evaluate our operations on a by unit and by market basis 
a number of our units have experienced significantly lower results at various points over the last three years  including ten units that incurred operating losses in  and four units that incurred operating losses in while the difficult market conditions over this period of time certainly influenced the performance of these units  we also experienced operational execution shortfalls that contributed to lower results 
the majority of such underperforming operations have been closed  sold  merged with stronger operations  or reduced in size or operating scope 
we also replaced management at most ongoing operations in this group 
the aggregate losses at units that lost money in were significantly less than the aggregate losses at units that lost money in we currently have operating units 
while it would be unusual in a group of this size to have no underperforming units even in better market conditions  we expect to again significantly reduce losses in as compared to with the difficult market conditions in our industry over recent years along with the integration challenges we encountered following our substantial acquisition growth during the period from to  we also operated in an environment of relatively tight credit restrictions from our lenders 
in addition  we have had to more actively manage our relationships with the surety market  through which we procure payment and performance bonds required for approximately of our work 
accordingly  cash flow and debt reduction were particularly high priorities for us over this period of time 
as a result of our sale of certain operations to emcor in early as well as our continued strong emphasis on cash flow  our debt outstanding  net of cash  is now at zero 
at the end of  we put a new credit facility in place with considerably less restrictive and more traditional terms than those of our previous facilities 
in addition  we have recently added a second surety to further support our bonding needs  and we believe our relationships with the surety markets  which have been effective over recent years  continue to improve in light of our strong current results and financial position 
we have generated positive free cash flow in fifteen of the last nineteen quarters  and will continue our emphasis in this area 
we believe that the relative size and strength of our balance sheet and surety support as compared to most companies in our industry represent competitive advantages for us 
as discussed at greater length in results of operations below  we have seen increased activity levels in our industry in  along with indications that increases may continue in we expect price competition to continue to be strong  as local and regional competitors respond cautiously to changing conditions 
we will continue our efforts to find the more active sectors in our markets  and to increase our regional and national account business 
however  our primary emphasis for will be on internal execution and margin improvement  rather than on revenue growth 
in addition to the work we have done on our underperforming units as described above  we have increased our focus on project qualification  estimating  pricing and management  and on service performance 
this focus includes significant increases in unit level training 
there has been substantial cost inflation in in certain commodities that are used in construction activity  including steel  iron  copper  lumber  and poly vinyl chloride pvc pipe 
we estimate that direct purchase of these commodities  principally steel  iron and copper  comprises between and of our average project cost 
as noted below in results of operations  for some of the project work we have performed in  the actual cost of certain commodities necessary for these projects was significantly greater than the commodity cost estimates we used when we committed to prices for these projects  which typically was done in before commodity cost inflation became apparent 
we experienced most of the negative effect of this unrecovered commodity cost inflation in the second quarter of this year 
we began taking steps early in to reduce future commodity cost exposure 
among these steps were early buying of commodities for particular projects  or for general inventory  as well as including escalation and escape provisions in project bids and contracts wherever possible 
following our second quarter impact  we experienced virtually no unrecovered cost inflation in the second half of however  commodity markets remain unsettled  and while we are taking steps as noted above to minimize unrecoverable commodity cost inflation  these steps cannot guarantee that we will avoid all such exposure 
more broadly  it is also possible that further increases in or uncertainty about commodity costs will decrease demand for nonresidential construction activity  which could in turn reduce our future revenues 
to date  though  we have not seen an identifiable negative effect of commodity costs on activity in our industry 
based on indications of stabilizing industry conditions and on our emphasis on internal execution and margin improvement  we expect that our results will be better than our results  although there can be no assurance that we will achieve this outcome 
over the longer term  if industry conditions are stable to improving  we believe we will experience more periods of increased revenues 
in addition  given the size and fragmentation of our industry  we believe it makes sense for us to consider acquisition possibilities 
however  we plan to do so on a very selective  opportunistic basis  and expect our growth in will largely be generated internally 
critical accounting policies in response to the commission s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we identified our critical accounting policies based upon the significance of the accounting policy to our overall financial statement presentation  as well as the complexity of the accounting policy and our use of estimates and subjective assessments 
we have concluded that our most critical accounting policy is our revenue recognition policy 
as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  our business has two service functions i installation  which we account for under the percentage of completion method  and ii maintenance  repair and replacement  which we account for as the services are performed  or in the case of replacement  under the percentage of completion method 
in addition  we identified other critical accounting policies related to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the recording of our self insurance liabilities  valuation of deferred tax assets and the assessment of goodwill impairment 
these accounting policies  as well as others  are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
percentage of completion method of accounting approximately of our revenues were earned on a project basis and recognized through the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method as provided by american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  contract revenue recognizable at any time during the life of a contract is determined by multiplying expected total contract revenue by the percentage of contract costs incurred at any time to total estimated contract costs 
more specifically  as part of the negotiation and bidding process in which we engage in connection with obtaining installation contracts  we estimate our contract costs  which include all direct materials exclusive of rebates  labor and subcontract costs and indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation costs 
then  as we perform under those contracts  we measure such costs incurred  compare them to total estimated costs to complete the contract  and recognize a corresponding proportion of contract revenue 
this measurement and comparison process requires updates to the estimate of total costs to complete the contract  and these updates may include subjective assessments 
our contracts typically provide for a schedule of billings or invoices to the customer based on reaching agreed upon milestones or as we incur costs 
the schedules for such billings usually do not precisely match the schedule on which we incur costs 
as a result  contract revenues recognized in the statement of operations can and usually do differ from amounts that can be billed or invoiced to the customer at any point during the contract 
amounts by which cumulative contract revenues recognized on a contract as of a given date exceed cumulative billings to the customer under the contract are reflected as a current asset in our balance sheet under the caption costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
amounts by which cumulative billings to the customer under a contract as of a given date exceed cumulative contract revenues recognized on the contract are reflected as a current liability in our balance sheet under the caption billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
the percentage of completion method of accounting is also affected by changes in job performance  job conditions  and final contract settlements 
these factors may result in revisions to estimated costs and  therefore  revenues 
such revisions are frequently based on further estimates and subjective assessments 
we recognize these revisions in the period in which they are determined 
if such revisions lead us to conclude that we will recognize a loss on a contract  the full amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the period we reach that conclusion  regardless of the percentage of completion of the contract 
revisions to project costs and conditions can give rise to change orders under which the customer agrees to pay additional contract price 
revisions can also result in claims we might make against the customer to recover project variances that have not been satisfactorily addressed through change orders with the customer 
except in certain circumstances  we do not recognize revenues or margin based on change orders or claims until they have been agreed upon with the customer 
the amount of revenue or deferral of costs associated with unapproved change orders and claims is currently immaterial 
variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results  depending on project size  and the recoverability of the variation via additional customer payments 
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts we are required to estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for receivable amounts we believe we will not ultimately collect 
this requires us to make certain judgments and estimates involving  among others  the creditworthiness of the customer  our prior collection history with the customer  ongoing relationships with the customer  the aging of past due balances  our lien rights  if any  in the property where we performed the work  and the availability  if any  of payment bonds applicable to our contract 
these estimates are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
accounting for self insurance liabilities we are substantially self insured for worker s compensation  employer s liability  auto liability  general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks 
losses up to deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts  historical trends and industry averages 
loss estimates associated with the larger and longer developing risks worker s compensation  auto liability and general liability are reviewed by a third party actuary semi annually 
we believe these accruals are adequate 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  timely reporting of occurrences  ongoing treatment or loss mitigation  general trends in litigation recovery outcomes and the effectiveness of safety and risk management programs 
therefore  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities  adjustments may be required and would be recorded in the period that such experience becomes known 
accounting for deferred tax assets we regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain 
we perform this evaluation at least annually at the end of each fiscal year 
the estimation of required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the activity underlying these assets becomes deductible 
we consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if actual future taxable income differs from our estimates  we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent we have estimated 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in most businesses we have acquired  the value we paid to buy the business was greater than the value of specifically identifiable net assets in the business 
under generally accepted accounting principles  this excess is termed goodwill and is recognized as an asset at the time the business is acquired 
it is generally expected that future net earnings from an acquired business will exceed the goodwill asset recognized at the time the business is bought 
under previous generally accepted accounting principles  goodwill was required to be amortized  or regularly charged to our operating results in our statement of operations 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  went into effect in we adopted it as of january  this new standard has two effects 
first  we are no longer required to amortize goodwill against our operating results 
second  we are required to regularly test the goodwill on our books to determine whether its value has been impaired  and if it has  to immediately write off  as a component of operating income  the amount of the goodwill that is impaired 
more specifically  we are required to assess our goodwill asset amounts for impairment each year  and more frequently if circumstances suggest an impairment may have occurred 
impairment must be reflected when the value of a given business unit in excess of its tangible net assets falls below the goodwill asset balance carried for that unit on our books 
if other business units have had increases in the value of their respective goodwill balances  such increases may not be recorded under sfas no 
accordingly  such increases may not be netted against impairments at other business units 
the new requirements for assessing whether goodwill assets have been impaired involve market based information 
this information  and its use in assessing goodwill  entails some degree of subjective assessment 
as part of the adoption of sfas no 
 we were required to make a one time determination of any transitional impairment loss by applying the standard s new  more rigorous valuation methodology 
the result of this transitional analysis was a million charge  net of tax benefit  reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations in the first quarter of additional impairment charges of million  million and million were recorded in operating results during the fourth quarters of  and  respectively 
the impairment charges during primarily resulted from changes in operating plans that were identified in the fourth quarter of for certain of our reporting units as part of our annual budgeting and business planning process 
the impairment charge during resulted from our estimation during the fourth quarter of that the operating environment  conditions and performance of certain of our entities could no longer support the goodwill balances associated with them

this table also excludes from operating income a restructuring charges  b amounts relating to the resolution of our receivables with kmart in connection with that company s bankruptcy  and c goodwill impairment charges in  and we have included this table because we believe it offers an additional view of the core results of our ongoing operations in a way we find useful in managing these operations  and in a way which also responds to frequent questions we receive about the company from third parties 
however  this presentation of operating results is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered an alternative to income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles and presented above in table historical results 
in particular  while this table excludes restructuring charges  we recorded them in each of the years in addition  impairment charges under the recently changed goodwill accounting rules are generally expected to occur periodically as goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition of businesses responds over time to changes in those businesses markets and operations

these gains were offset to a lesser degree by lower revenues relating to consolidation of certain underperforming operations in northern and southern california  western colorado and alabama 
backlog reflects revenues still to be recognized under contracted or committed installation and replacement project work  and under service agreements 
project work generally lasts less than one year 
service work and short duration projects are generally billed as performed and therefore do not flow through backlog 
accordingly  backlog represents only a portion of our revenues for any given future period  and it represents revenues that are likely to be reflected in our operating results over the next six to twelve months 
as a result  we believe the predictive value of backlog information is limited to indications of general revenue direction over the near term  and should not be interpreted as indicative of ongoing revenue performance over several quarters 
backlog associated with continuing operations as of december  was million  a increase from december  backlog of million  and an increase from september  backlog of million 
these gains result primarily from strong bookings in the multi family sector  along with significant new government work in california and education work in wisconsin and texas 
following the three year period of industry activity declines from noted previously  we saw modest year over year revenue increases at our ongoing operations beginning in the third and fourth quarters of and continuing throughout we continue to see signs that activity levels in our industry may continue to increase in these observations are based on nonresidential construction spending trends  shipment data from hvac equipment manufacturers  forecasts from construction industry analysts  and anecdotal indications of renewed project consideration 
we and other industry participants also believe that there was a general deferral of maintenance and replacement activity in the installed base of commercial  industrial  and institutional hvac equipment  in response to the more difficult economic conditions of we and other industry participants believe this trend may be diminishing due to both the mechanical nature and requirements of the equipment  as well as improving economic conditions  but it is not clear when maintenance and replacement activity might increase 
while we believe these trends and expectations are positive  there can be no assurance that industry activity levels will actually increase in or in the foreseeable future 
along with the indications noted above that suggest industry activity is improving  there remain the following cautionary factors in the industry environment  each of which is discussed at greater length in the introduction above 
since hvac and related installation and replacement decisions are capital decisions usually involving some amount of discretion  they tend to be affected to a greater degree by macroeconomic or geopolitical uncertainty 
negative developments or events in these arenas  should they occur  will likely cause end users to defer hvac and related spending decisions  thereby reducing our revenues 
we continue to experience a noticeable amount of price competition in our markets  which restrains our ability to increase revenues 
there has been significant inflation in in the cost of certain commodities used in the construction sector  including steel  iron  copper  lumber  pvc pipe  and motor vehicle fuel 
this inflation does not appear to have affected our revenues or backlog  and has had only a modest impact on our profitability  as discussed further below under gross profit 
however  more broadly  it is possible that further increases in or uncertainty about commodity costs will decrease demand for nonresidential construction activity  which could in turn reduce our future revenues 
to date  though  we have not seen any negative effect of commodity costs on demand for our services 
while we believe we will see increased industry activity levels in  in view of all of the foregoing factors  we may continue to experience only modest revenue growth or revenue declines in upcoming periods 
in addition  if general economic activity in the us slows significantly from current levels  we may realize decreases in revenue and lower operating margins 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  historical gross profit for and was  and down from in at ongoing operations 
our relatively small change in gross profit percentage resulted from several offsetting items 
we realized significantly lower workers compensation and liability costs which we believe result in part from our longstanding emphasis on safety and risk management in our operations 
we also saw substantially improved gross profit margins at our houston based multi family operations as that unit improved its project selection and management performance while benefiting from healthy multi family demand in a number of markets 
these improvements were offset by a wind down of lower profit activities associated with consolidation of operations in northern california and in san diego  along with related consolidation costs  b reduced profitability in our tennessee operations resulting from project margin erosion and a settlement on a project claim  and c lower margins associated with larger average project size in our syracuse and birmingham operations 
there has been substantial cost inflation in in certain commodities that are used in construction activity  including steel  iron  and copper 
we estimate that direct purchase of these commodities comprises between and of our average project costs 
for some projects we performed in  the actual cost of these commodities was significantly greater than the commodity cost estimates we used when we committed to prices for these projects  which typically was done in before commodity price inflation became apparent 
we estimate that unrecovered commodity inflation had a negative effect of approximately million on gross profit  or of revenues  most of which occurred during the second quarter 
we began taking steps early in to reduce future commodity cost exposure  such as early buying of commodities for particular projects  or for general inventory  as well as including escalation and escape provisions in project bids and contracts wherever possible 
following our second quarter impact  we experienced virtually no unrecovered cost inflation in the third and fourth quarters 
however  commodity markets remain unsettled  and while we are taking steps as noted above to minimize unrecoverable commodity cost inflation  these steps cannot guarantee that we will avoid all such exposure 
gross profit indications in our backlog as of december  were basis points lower than they were at the end of the preceding quarter  and basis points lower than they were at december  these declines result in part from significant addition of project work in the second half of  much of which was larger  longer term projects which tend to have lower margins 
backlog scheduled to be performed in the next six months tends to represent a broader cross section of our business as it includes smaller  near term project work as well as larger projects 
gross profit indications in six month backlog as of december  are up basis points from the preceding quarter and up basis points from december  nonetheless  we remain cautious about gross profit expectations in coming periods 
while we believe industry activity levels are increasing  they appear to be doing so at only a modest rate  and still remain at relatively moderate levels following the three years of decline the industry experienced from to we expect continuing price competition in this environment until noticeably higher activity levels are reached and until the majority of our competition becomes convinced that industry growth is more than temporary 
additionally  with regard to gross profit indications in backlog  as noted above under revenues  a significant portion of our activity is not captured in backlog at any given quarterend due to the amount of service and short duration project work we do 
further  we can and have experienced lower final gross profit margins when work in backlog is ultimately completed  as compared to the gross profit indications that work had when it was only partially completed or new to backlog 
accordingly  while gross profit information in backlog provides some indication of general direction of gross profit  it does not assure future levels or trends in consolidated gross profit percentage 
as noted in the introduction above  we are currently placing a greater emphasis on internal execution and margin improvement than on revenue growth 
this includes a strong focus on those of our units that have underperformed  along with increased training efforts on project qualification  estimating  pricing and management  and on service performance 
while we believe these efforts will help us increase gross profits  we cannot assure that this will occur 
further  if we are successful in these efforts  we cannot assure that they will offset adverse industry trends  if such trends occur 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a decreased million  or  to million in compared to  and as a percentage of revenues  declined from in to in these decreases resulted primarily from consolidation of certain operating units in san diego  salt lake city  colorado  and northern california  along with lower medical costs resulting from benefit plan structure changes and favorable claims experience 
goodwill amortization and impairment we no longer amortize goodwill via regular charges to our income statement due to our adoption of sfas see cumulative effect of change in accounting principle below for further discussion 
additional goodwill impairment charges of million and million were recorded during the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
the impairment charges during primarily resulted from changes in operating plans that were identified in the fourth quarter of for certain of our reporting units as part of our annual budgeting and business planning process 
the impairment charge during resulted from our estimation during the fourth quarter of that the operating environment  conditions and performance of certain of our entities could no longer support the goodwill balances associated with them 
restructuring charges during the first three quarters of  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million pre tax 
these charges included approximately million for severance costs and retention bonuses primarily associated with the curtailment of our energy efficiency marketing activities  a reorganization of our national accounts operations as well as a reduction in corporate personnel 
the severance costs and retention bonuses related to the termination of employees  all of whom had left the company by december  the restructuring charges for this period also included approximately million for remaining lease obligations and million of other costs recorded in connection with the actions described above 
interest expense  net interest expense  net for and included the following primary elements in thousands interest expense on borrowings  and unused commitment fees letter of credit fees amortization of deferred debt arrangement costs and discount mark to market adjustments on derivatives interest income total interest expense is significantly lower in as compared to as a result of much lower debt levels in stemming from higher cash balances during the current year  and because our current credit facility cost noticeably less in upfront fees when it was established in the fourth quarter of  thereby resulting in lower ongoing amortization of these fees in the current year 
other expense income other expense was million for and million for other expense for includes losses of million resulting from mark to market adjustments on a warrant that was outstanding with a third party to buy shares of our stock 
the warrant also carried a put obligation 
this warrant was exercised in october this exercise also terminated the related put obligation 
as a result  there will be no further mark to market adjustments relating to this warrant and put subsequent to the third quarter of other expense in the first quarter of includes a loss of million on the disposition of a division of one of our operations 
write off of debt costs and discount  net in the fourth quarter of we recorded a non cash write off of million of deferred debt arrangement costs and discount when we terminated our previous credit facility 
these amounts were partially offset by a million gain associated with the reduction in the value of a warrant and put obligation that arose when the facility terminated in the fourth quarter was originally established 
this reduction in the value of the warrant and put obligation resulted from a significant restriction in the holder s ability to exercise the put provision 
this restriction was agreed to by the holder in connection with terminating the related facility 
we also reflected a non cash charge of million in the first quarter of for deferred debt costs that were associated with previously higher levels of capacity under this credit facility 
the following table recaps these writeoffs in thousands write off of deferred financing fees and transaction costs write off of discount originally arising from issue of stock warrant and related put to credit facility lender reduction in valuation of warrant and put obligation total income tax expense benefit our effective tax rate associated with results from continuing operations for was as compared to in as noted above  we recorded an impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of this impairment is not deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the effect of this impairment  our effective rate was 
this rate is lower than usual due to an increase in the fourth quarter of in our estimate of the amount of future state taxable income we will have against which we can apply state tax loss carryforwards 
this change in estimate resulted in a reduction in our allowance against state level deferred tax assets 
while we regularly evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets relating to tax losses or benefits we have incurred  it should not be expected that such evaluations will regularly result in decreases to our effective tax 
for example  in the more difficult economic and operating environments of recent years including as noted below  such evaluations have led to increases in our related allowances  and thus increases in our effective tax rate 
excluding the effect of our reduction in state deferred tax allowances  as well as the effect of nondeductible goodwill impairment noted above  our effective rate for would have been 
in the fourth quarter of  our year to date pre tax income from continuing operations turned negative as we recognized significant charges for the write off of deferred debt arrangement costs and for goodwill impairment 
the effective benefit rate on our full year pre tax loss further increased over statutory rates to as a result of additional tax adjustments in the fourth quarter 
these adjustments included benefit for the reversal of tax contingency reserves no longer deemed necessary as a result of an updated review of our tax positions across the jurisdictions in which we do business  offset to a lesser degree by additional reserves against state level deferred tax assets  and recognition of the effect of the nondeductible portion of the goodwill impairment we recorded in the fourth quarter of during  the american jobs creation act of was signed into law 
the primary effect of this legislation will be to permit us to claim a deduction for of earnings related to certain of our construction related activities beginning in this deduction is expected to modestly decrease our effective tax rate 
we currently estimate that our effective tax rate for will be between and 
discontinued operations individual sales of operating companies during and  we sold four small operating companies in separate transactions 
the after tax income of these companies has been reported in discontinued operations under operating results  net of tax and is recapped below 
losses we recognized on the sales of these units have been reported in discontinued operations under estimated gain loss on disposition  including tax and are recapped below 
these losses primarily resulted from the non cash writeoff of goodwill associated with these units 
these goodwill writeoffs were not tax deductible 
year ended december  in thousands after tax income for four operating companies sold separately in and  reported in discontinued operations under operating results  net of tax losses on the sales of four operating companies sold separately in and  reported in discontinued operations under estimated gain loss on disposition  including tax discontinued operations sale of companies to emcor on march   we sold operations to emcor group 
the total purchase price was million  including the assumption by emcor of approximately million of subordinated notes to former owners of certain of the divested companies 
we have realized an aggregate loss of million  including related tax expense  in connection with the sale of these operations  substantially all of which was recorded in as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we also recognized a goodwill impairment charge related to these operations of million  net of tax benefit  as of january  there are ongoing open matters relating to this transaction that we continue to address with emcor 
we do not believe these open matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material effect on our financial position when ultimately resolved 
we maintain reserves for these matters  net of amounts receivable from escrow that we believe will ultimately be applied in settling these matters 
during the second quarter of  we concluded that the related reserves should be reduced by million  net of tax 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we reduced these reserves by million  net of tax 
these amounts are reflected in discontinued operations in as a reduction in the estimated loss on disposition of discontinued operations 
outlook as noted earlier in this review  while we see signs that industry activity levels are continuing to increase in  our primary emphasis for this year is on margin improvement more so than revenue growth 
our ongoing margin efforts include a focus on improving the results of units that incurred losses or subpar income in  and on intensified project and service performance training at the unit level 
based on these margin improvement efforts and developments  on our increased level of backlog as compared to recent periods  and on our belief that industry and economic conditions are improving  we expect that our full year results will be better than our results  although there can be no assurance that we will achieve this outcome 
compared to revenues revenues decreased million  or  to million in compared to the decline in revenue was comprised of a increase in revenue at ongoing operations and a decline in revenue related to operations that were sold during the modest increase in revenues at ongoing operations in resulted primarily from a continuation of mixed economic conditions in numerous markets 
these conditions originated with the general economic slowdown in the us which began in this slowdown led to deferral of both new and replacement project activity  and also resulted in a more competitive pricing environment 
activity levels in our industry worsened in late and early based on renewed uncertainty about the economy and international events 
we saw some stabilization in the second half of as revenue at ongoing operations showed small year over year increases in the third and fourth quarters 
backlog primarily contains installation and replacement project work  and maintenance agreements 
these projects generally last less than one year 
service work and short duration projects are generally billed as performed and therefore do not flow through backlog 
accordingly  backlog represents only a portion of our revenues for any given future period  and it represents revenues that are likely to be reflected in our operating results over the next six to twelve months 
as a result  we believe the predictive value of backlog information is limited to indications of general revenue direction over the near term  and should not be interpreted as indicative of ongoing revenue performance over several quarters 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  historical gross profit decreased from in to in  and posted a similar decline in ongoing operations 
the decline in gross profit in as compared to primarily resulted from lower industry activity levels  increased price competition  and moderate execution shortfalls in five of our operations  offset to a lesser degree by improved efficiency at three of our operations 
two of the operations with shortfalls were combined with other units 
the other three were more established operations at which performance improved in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  sg a decreased from in to in during the second quarter of  we reversed million of the bad debt reserves that were established in the fourth quarter of related to our receivables with kmart as a result of a bankruptcy related settlement with kmart 
accordingly  the decrease in normal sg a from to was greater by this amount 
the decrease in sg a resulted from the following a the sale or closure of certain units that did not qualify for discontinued operations presentation  b the substantial downsizing in the first quarter of of our marketing initiative emphasizing energy efficiency  c decreased outlays for medical costs  and d a concerted effort to reduce sg a throughout our company 
goodwill amortization and impairment we no longer amortize goodwill via regular charges to our income statement due to our adoption of sfas no 
see cumulative effect of change in accounting principle below for further discussion 
additional goodwill impairment charges of million and million were recorded during the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
the impairment charge in primarily resulted from changes in operating plans that were identified for certain of our reporting units in the fourth quarter as part of our annual budgeting and business planning process 
restructuring charges during the first three quarters of  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million pre tax 
these charges included approximately million for severance costs and retention bonuses primarily associated with the curtailment of our energy efficiency marketing activities  a reorganization of our national accounts operations as well as a reduction in corporate personnel 
the severance costs and retention bonuses related to the termination of employees  all of whom had left the company by december  the restructuring charges for this period also included approximately million for remaining lease obligations and million of other costs recorded in connection with the actions described above 
during the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million 
these charges included approximately million for severance costs primarily associated with the reduction in corporate office overhead in light of our smaller size following the emcor transaction described below under discontinued operations 
the severance costs related to the termination of employees  all of whom had left the company by march  these restructuring charges also included approximately million for costs associated with decisions to merge or close three smaller divisions and realign regional operating management 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  decreased million to million in this decline resulted from lower average borrowing levels and market interest rates in  offset to a lesser degree by increased letter of credit fees and mark to market adjustments associated with a stock warrant and put that were issued in connection with the original establishment of the credit facility we had in effect in interest expense for and included the following primary elements in thousands interest expense on borrowings  and unused commitment fees letter of credit fees a amortization of deferred debt arrangement costs mark to market adjustments on derivatives interest income total a in  letter of credit amounts outstanding and related fees were significantly lower 
these fees were treated as an element of bank service charges in selling  general and administrative expenses during this period 
other income expense other expense was million for  and other income was million for first quarter includes a loss of million on the disposition of a division of one of our operations 
other income for includes a gain of million on the sale of the residential portion of one of our operations in the second quarter of  and a gain of million related to the extinguishment of subordinated debt in the fourth quarter of write off of debt costs and discount  net in the fourth quarter of we recorded a non cash write off of million of deferred debt arrangement costs and discount when we terminated our previous credit facility 
these amounts were partially offset by a million gain associated with the reduction in the value of a stock warrant and put obligation that arose when the facility terminated in the fourth quarter was originally established 
this reduction in the value of the warrant and put obligation resulted from a significant restriction in the holder s ability to exercise the put provision 
this restriction was agreed to by the holder in connection with terminating the related facility 
we also reflected a non cash charge of million in the first quarter of for deferred debt costs that were associated with previously higher levels of capacity under this credit facility 
in the fourth quarter of we recorded a non cash write off of million of debt costs when we terminated a preceding credit facility 
the first quarter of includes a non cash writedown of million of debt costs in connection with the reduction in our borrowing capacity following the emcor transaction 
the following table recaps these writeoffs in thousands write off of deferred financing fees and transaction costs write off of discount originally arising from issue of stock warrant and related put to credit facility lender reduction in valuation of warrant and put obligation total income tax expense benefit our effective tax rates associated with results from continuing operations for and were and  respectively 
our effective rates in and in the first three quarters of were higher than statutory rates because of the effect of certain expenses that we incur that are not deductible for tax purposes  and due to reserves that we have established against certain deferred tax assets based on the possibility that we will not be able to ultimately realize the tax benefit for certain losses we have incurred  primarily at the state income tax level 
in addition  since our recent pre tax profit margins have been relatively low on a historical and an absolute basis  the impact of non deductible expenses on our effective rate in these periods is magnified 
in the fourth quarter of  our year to date pre tax income from continuing operations turned negative as we recognized significant charges for the write off of deferred debt arrangement costs and for goodwill impairment 
the effective benefit rate on our full year pre tax loss further increased over statutory rates to as a result of additional tax adjustments in the fourth quarter 
these adjustments included benefit for the reversal of tax contingency reserves no longer deemed necessary as a result of an updated review of our tax positions across the jurisdictions in which we do business  offset to a lesser degree by additional reserves against state level deferred tax assets that may be not fully realized  and recognition of the effect of the nondeductible portion of the goodwill impairment we recorded in the fourth quarter 
discontinued operations individual sales of operating companies during and  we sold four small operating companies in separate transactions 
the after tax income of these companies has been reported in discontinued operations under operating results  net of tax and is recapped below 
losses we recognized on the sales of these units have been reported in discontinued operations under estimated gain loss on disposition  including tax and are recapped below 
these losses primarily resulted from the non cash writeoff of goodwill associated with these units 
these goodwill writeoffs were not tax deductible

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which took effect for us on january   the operating results of the companies sold to emcor for all periods presented through the sale  as well as the loss on the sale of these operations  have been presented under discontinued operations 
during  we realized an aggregate loss of million on this transaction  including related tax expense and including charges in the fourth quarter of for matters resolved after closing 
this aggregate loss has subsequently been reduced in by million based on declines in our estimates of reserves necessary for ongoing matters related to the transaction 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we also recognized a goodwill impairment charge related to these operations of million  net of tax benefit  as of january  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which required a transitional assessment of our goodwill assets went into effect in we adopted it as of january  to perform the transitional impairment testing required by sfas no 
under its new  more rigorous impairment criteria  we broke our operations into reporting units based on the degree of operating and financial independence of each unit and our related management of them  as prescribed by the new standard  and tested each of these reporting units for impairment by comparing the unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model combined with market valuation approaches 
significant estimates and assumptions were used in assessing the fair value of reporting units 
these estimates and assumptions involved future cash flows  growth rates  discount rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market valuations for each of the reporting units 
as provided by sfas no 
 the transitional impairment loss identified by applying the standard s new  more rigorous valuation methodology upon initial adoption of the standard was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our results of operations 
the resulting non cash charge was million  net of tax benefit  and was recorded during the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities free cash flow cash provided by operating activities taxes paid related to the sale of businesses purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sales of property and equipment free cash flow cash flow we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities excluding items related to sales of businesses  less customary capital expenditures  plus the proceeds from asset sales 
positive free cash flow represents funds available to invest in significant operating initiatives  to acquire other companies  or to reduce a company s outstanding debt or equity 
if free cash flow is negative  additional debt or equity is generally required to fund the outflow of cash 
free cash flow may be defined differently by other companies 
our business does not require significant amounts of investment in long term fixed assets 
the substantial majority of the capital used in our business is working capital that funds our costs of labor and installed equipment deployed in project work until our customers pay us 
customary terms in our industry allow customers to withhold a small portion of the contract price until after we have completed the work  typically for six months 
amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage 
our average project duration together with typical retention terms generally allow us to complete the realization of revenue and earnings in cash within one year 
accordingly  we believe free cash flow  by encompassing both profit margins and the use of working capital over our approximately one year working capital cycle  is an effective measure of operating effectiveness and efficiency 
we have included free cash flow information here for this reason  and because we are often asked about it by third parties evaluating the company 
however  free cash flow is not considered under generally accepted accounting principles to be a primary measure of an entity s financial results  and accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to operating income  net income  or amounts shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows as determined under generally accepted accounting principles 
for the year ended december   free cash flow of million was essentially unchanged from million in this resulted primarily from increased profitability net of a modest increase in capital expenditures in as compared to excluding taxes related to the sale of businesses  we reduced working capital by about the same amounts in both and  thus improving our working capital efficiency in both periods 
for the year ended december   we had free cash flow of million as compared to million in this increase resulted primarily from using about million less in working capital to support our operations in as compared to when we increased our working capital investment by million 
credit facility on december   we entered into a senior credit facility the facility provided by a syndicate of banks 
as of december  the total of the facility was million  with million in borrowings outstanding  million in letters of credit outstanding  and million of credit available 
in addition to this credit capacity  as of december   we had million in cash 
as of february   the total of the facility was million  with million in borrowings outstanding  million in letters of credit outstanding  and million of credit available 
the facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including the capital stock of all our current and future subsidiaries and substantially all of their assets 
amounts due under the facility are also guaranteed by our current and future subsidiaries 
the facility consists of two parts a term loan and a revolving credit facility 
the original term loan under the facility the term loan was million  which the company borrowed upon the closing of the facility 
the term loan must be repaid in installments of million payable at the beginning of each quarter over five years  the first installment of which was paid in the second quarter of the facility requires prepayments of the term loan in certain circumstances generally involving the sale of assets 
all principal payments under the term loan permanently reduce the original million capacity under this portion of the facility 
the facility also included a three year million revolving credit facility the revolving loan available for borrowings or letters of credit 
this was increased to million in the second quarter of letters of credit are discussed at greater length below under off balance sheet arrangements and other commitments 
the facility requires that borrowings outstanding under the revolving loan must be less than million for ten consecutive business days at least once during each year 
we have already satisfied this condition for our borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under the facility at each monthend must be less than a borrowing base measured as of the same monthend 
the borrowing base is defined under the facility as of the following total trade receivables including costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  less allowances for doubtful accounts  less receivables related to projects that are subject to payment or performance bonds 
the borrowing base as of december  was million 
this borrowing base is substantially greater than the current million face value limit of the facility 
we do not expect that this borrowing base provision will limit credit available under the facility in the foreseeable future 
our borrowing and letter of credit capacity under the revolving loan portion of the facility at any given time is million less borrowings and letters of credit outstanding  subject to the borrowing base described above 
the facility contains financial covenants defining various financial measures and the levels of these measures with which we must comply  as discussed further below 
covenant compliance is measured as of each quarterend 
while the facility s financial covenants do not specifically govern capacity under the facility  if our debt level under the facility at a quarterend covenant compliance measurement date caused us to violate the facility s debt to ebitda covenant described in more detail below our borrowing capacity under the facility could be restricted by the lenders 
accordingly  available capacity amounts shown below are presented both on a financial covenant basis and on a facility face value basis 
as of december  as of february  in thousands amounts outstanding revolving loan term loan other non facility debt total debt letters of credit available capacity unused revolving loan and letter of credit capacity based on revolving loan face value of million unused revolving loan and letter of credit capacity based on quarterend debt to ebitda covenant n a the facility contains financial covenants defining various financial measures and the levels of these measures with which we must comply 
covenant compliance is assessed as of each quarterend 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is defined under the facility for financial covenant purposes as net earnings for the four quarters ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date  plus the corresponding amounts for a interest expense  b income taxes  c depreciation and amortization  and d other non cash charges 
the facility s principal financial covenants include debt service coverage ratio the facility requires that the ratio of ebitda to the sum of interest expense and scheduled principal payments be at least 
interest expense is defined under the facility for purposes of this covenant as interest expense for the four quarters ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date  excluding corresponding twelve month amounts for a amortization of deferred debt arrangement costs  and b mark to market interest expense 
scheduled principal payments for this ratio are also measured for the twelve months ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date 
the company s debt service coverage ratio as of december  as measured under this covenant was as compared to a minimum covenant requirement of 
tangible net worth the facility requires that our tangible net worth not be less than the sum of a million  b of net income earned beginning october   and c the net proceeds of any equity transactions 
for purposes of this ratio  the facility defines tangible net worth as stockholders equity less the book value of the following intangible assets goodwill  patents  copyrights  licenses  franchises  trade names  trade secrets  and operating leases 
the facility also provides that for purposes of this ratio  net income excludes any goodwill impairment charges 
the company s tangible net worth as of december  as measured under this covenant was million  as compared to a covenant minimum of million 
debt to ebitda the facility requires that our ratio of debt to ebitda not exceed our debt to ebitda ratio as of december  as measured under this covenant was 
capital expenditures the facility limits capital expenditures to million per year 
our capital expenditures during the twelve months ended december  were million 
surety surety bonding is discussed in more depth later in this section 
the facility contains provisions that may have the practical effect of limiting our use of surety bonding in excess of million of bonded backlog to the lesser of a the amount of surety bonds outstanding which results in the ratio of receivables relating to bonded contracts to total receivables not exceeding  and b million in bonded backlog 
as of december   our ratio of bonded receivables to total receivables was  and our bonded backlog was million 
other restrictions the facility prohibits payment of dividends and repurchase of shares by the company  and limits non facility debt  capital lease obligations  acquisitions  investments  and sales of assets 
the facility also includes a customary provision under which the lenders may demand immediate repayment of borrowings and disposition of letters of credit if they conclude that our business or financial position has suffered a material adverse change 
however  the facility does not include any mechanisms allowing the lenders immediate access to our ongoing cash flow in the event of a default or an immediate repayment demand by the lenders 
in view of our financial position  and what we believe are our prospects for profitability and positive cash flow in the future  we believe that the probability that our lenders will invoke the material adverse change provision of the facility in the foreseeable future is remote 
as a result  debt under the facility is classified as long term  other than amounts due within one year 
off balance sheet arrangements and other commitments as is common in our industry  we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
our most significant off balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with noncancelable operating leases 
we also have other off balance sheet obligations involving letters of credit and surety guarantees 
we enter into noncancelable operating leases for many of our facility  vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities  vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
if we decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term  we would typically owe the lessor the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease 
certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf  such as to beneficiaries under our self funded insurance programs 
we have also occasionally used letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts 
the letters of credit we provide are actually issued by our lenders through the facility as described above 
a letter of credit commits the lenders to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions 
if this were to occur  we would be required to reimburse the lenders 
depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement  we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement 
absent a claim  there is no payment or reserving of funds by us in connection with a letter of credit 
however  because a claim on a letter of credit would require immediate reimbursement by us to our lenders  letters of credit are treated as a use of the facility s capacity just the same as actual borrowings 
claims against letters of credit are rare in our industry 
to date we have not had a claim made against a letter of credit that resulted in payments by a lender or by us 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future 
many customers  particularly in connection with new construction  require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety 
if we fail to perform under the terms of a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors who provided goods or services under a contract  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the sureties for any expenses or outlays they incur 
to date  we are not aware of any losses to our sureties in connection with bonds the sureties have posted on our behalf  and we do not expect such losses to be incurred in the foreseeable future 
surety market conditions are currently challenging as a result of significant losses incurred by many sureties in recent periods  both in the construction industry as well as in certain larger corporate bankruptcies 
as a result  less bonding capacity is available in the market and terms have become more restrictive 
further  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue bonds on a project by project basis  and can decline to issue bonds at any time 
historically  approximately of our business has required bonds 
while we have enjoyed a longstanding relationship with our primary surety and we have recently added another surety to further support our bonding needs  current market conditions as well as changes in our sureties assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause our sureties to decline to issue bonds for our work 
if that were to occur  our alternatives include doing more business that does not require bonds  posting other forms of collateral for project performance such as letters of credit or cash  and seeking bonding capacity from other sureties 
we would likely also encounter concerns from customers  suppliers and other market participants as to our creditworthiness 
while we believe our general operating and financial characteristics  including a significantly greater amount of cash on our balance sheet than debt  would enable us to ultimately respond effectively to an interruption in the availability of bonding capacity  such an interruption would likely cause our revenues and profits to decline in the near term 
the following recaps the future maturities of our debt along with other contractual obligations as of december  in thousands twelve months ended december  thereafter total revolving loan term loan other debt total debt operating lease obligations as of december  we also have million of letter of credit commitments  all of which expire in the substantial majority of these letters of credit are posted with insurers who disburse funds on our behalf in connection with our worker s compensation  auto liability and general liability insurance program 
these letters of credit provide additional security to the insurers that sufficient financial resources will be available to fund claims on our behalf  many of which develop over long periods of time  should we ever encounter financial duress 
posting of letters of credit for this purpose is a common practice for entities that manage their self insurance programs through third party insurers as we do 
while these letter of credit commitments expire in  we expect nearly all of them  particularly those supporting our insurance programs  will be renewed annually 
in addition  given the estimated size and duration of funding of claims under our worker s compensation  auto liability and general liability insurance programs  we recently agreed with our insurers that we will increase the amount of letters of credit posted with them in quarterly installments beginning in november and aggregating to an additional million in letters of credit outstanding in august other than the operating lease obligations noted above  we have no significant purchase or operating commitments outside of commitments to deliver equipment and provide labor in the ordinary course of performing project work 
outlook we have generated positive net free cash flow in fifteen of the last nineteen quarters  most of which occurred during challenging economic and industry conditions 
we also have a relatively low level of debt  significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility  and cash balances that exceed our total debt by a sizable amount 
we believe these factors will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
seasonality and cyclicality the hvac industry is subject to seasonal variations 
specifically  the demand for new installation and replacement is generally lower during the winter months the first quarter of the year due to reduced construction activity during inclement weather and less use of air conditioning during the colder months 
demand for hvac services is generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters due to increased construction activity and increased use of air conditioning during the warmer months 
accordingly  we expect our revenues and operating results generally will be lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
historically  the construction industry has been highly cyclical 
as a result  our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in new installation and replacement projects in various geographic regions of the united states 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  statement r which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement 
statement r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  opinion and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted for periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r on july  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt statement r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options in our results of operations 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our reported results of operations  although it will have no impact on our cash flows 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such tax benefits were million and million in and  respectively 
factors which may affect future results our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors  including the retention of key management  national or regional declines in non residential construction activity  difficulty in obtaining or increased costs associated with debt financing or bonding  shortages of labor and specialty building materials  seasonal fluctuations in the demand for hvac systems and the use of incorrect estimates for bidding fixed price contracts 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results or cash flows on a quarterly or annual basis 
labor and overhead costs account for the majority of our cost of service 
accordingly  labor management and utilization have the most impact on our project performance 
given the fixed price nature of much of our project work  if our initial estimate of project costs is wrong or we incur cost overruns that cannot be recovered in change orders  we can experience reduced profits or even significant losses on fixed price project work 
we also perform some project work on a cost plus or a time and materials basis  under which we are paid our costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit margin 
these margins are typically less than fixed price contract margins because there is less risk of unrecoverable cost overruns in cost plus or time and materials work 
many customers  particularly in connection with new construction  require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety 
if we fail to perform under the terms of a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors who provided goods or services under a contract  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the surety for any expense or outlays it incurs 
to date  we have not had any significant reimbursements to our surety for bond related costs 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future 
surety market conditions are currently challenging as a result of significant losses incurred by many sureties in recent periods  both in the construction industry as well as in certain larger corporate bankruptcies 
as a result  less bonding capacity is available in the market and terms have become more restrictive 
further  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue bonds on a project by project basis  and can decline to issue bonds at any time 
historically  approximately of our business has required bonds 
while we have enjoyed a longstanding relationship with our primary surety  and we have recently added another surety to further support our bonding needs  current market conditions as well as changes in our sureties assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause our sureties to decline to issue bonds for our work 
if that were to occur  our alternatives would include doing more business that does not require bonds  posting other forms of collateral for project performance such as letters of credit or cash  and seeking bonding capacity from other sureties 
there can be no assurance that we could easily achieve these alternatives 
accordingly  if we were to experience an interruption in the availability of bonding capacity  our revenues and profits could decline 
key elements of our strategy are to both maintain and improve the profitability and cash flow of the individual businesses 
our level of success in this strategy  if any  will be affected by demand for new or replacement hvac systems 
in part  such demand will be contingent upon factors outside our control  such as the level of new construction or the potential for slower replacement based upon the overall level of activity in the economy 
the hvac industry is subject to both seasonal and cyclical variations  meaning that temperate weather and downturns in the domestic or regional economies will negatively affect overall demand for our services 
the timely provision of high quality installation service and maintenance  repair and replacement of hvac systems requires an adequate supply of skilled hvac technicians 
accordingly  our ability to maintain and increase our productivity and profitability is affected by our ability to employ  train and retain the skilled technicians necessary to meet our service requirements 
most of our operations compete on a local or regional basis 
attracting and retaining effective operating unit managers is an important factor in our business  particularly in view of the relative uniqueness of each market and operation  the importance of relationships with customers and other market participants such as architects and consulting engineers  and the high degree of competition and low barriers to entry in most of our markets 
accordingly  we devote considerable attention to operating unit management quality  stability  and contingency planning  including related considerations of compensation  and non competition protection where applicable 
there is no assurance that we will be able to retain these individuals or find suitable replacements if such individuals leave the company 
the failure to retain or replace such management on a timely basis could negatively impact results from operations at such locations 
hvac systems are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations  including the clean air act and those regulating the production  servicing and disposal of certain ozone depleting refrigerants used in hvac systems 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly in the future 
our failure to comply  or the costs of compliance  with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our future results 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not necessarily be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not rely solely on historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  general conditions in the hvac industry  changes in analysts earnings estimates  recommendations by analysts  or other events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates as discussed below 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant financial market risks including commodity price risk except as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
management does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from our short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
our debt with fixed interest rates consists of capital leases and various notes payable 
our debt with variable interest rates consists entirely of our facility
