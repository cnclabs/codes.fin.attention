item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide computer based and e learning instruction software and related services for kindergarten through adult learners  offering curricula in reading  writing  math  science  social studies  and life and job skills 
we also offer online assessment and accountability solutions and standards based professional development services 
with over  hours of objective based  problem solving courseware  plus assessment  alignment  and curriculum management tools  we create standards based curricula that facilitate learning and school improvement 
plato educational software is delivered via networks  cd rom  the internet  and private intranets 
we market our software products and related services primarily to k schools and colleges 
we also sell to job training programs  correctional institutions  military education programs  corporations  and individuals 
we are subject to risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  dependence on information technology spending by our customers  well established competitors  customers dependent on government funding  fluctuations of our quarterly results  a lengthy and variable sales cycle  dependence on key personnel  dependence on our intellectual property rights  rapid technological change  and our ability to integrate acquisitions 
as provided for in the private securities litigation reform act of  we caution investors that these factors  and those discussed under risk factors in item of this annual report on form k  could cause our future results of operations to vary from those anticipated in previously made forward looking statements and any other forward looking statements made in this document and elsewhere by or on behalf of us 
our fiscal year is from november to october unless otherwise stated  references to the years   and relate to the fiscal years ended october    and  respectively 
references to future years also relate to our fiscal year ending october in november  we acquired lightspan  inc lightspan  a provider of curriculum based educational software and online assessment products and services that increase student achievement and enhance teacher professional development 
these products are used in schools and homes and align all key federal reform initiatives  offering school districts a comprehensive achievement and accountability system to assess  align  instruct  and evaluate 
this acquisition strengthens our product offerings  with two strong and complimentary brands  in the k and post secondary markets 
it also enhances our ability to provide comprehensive solutions to k and adult learning institutions 
the combination of lightspan and plato learning also unites lightspan s academic systems products with our community college products to establish the largest provider of online content for under prepared college students 
in addition  the merger of sales forces has provided critical mass for servicing elementary  secondary  district level  and colleges across all product lines and services 
we believe these advantages  plus the elimination of significant duplicate costs  will provide greater earnings and cash flow potential for the combined company  and ultimately a greater valuation 
in december  we acquired new media holdings limited new media  a united kingdom uk based publisher of curriculum focused software primarily for teaching secondary school science and math 
this acquisition enhances our science offering  provides a science simulation development capability that we did not previously have and will allow us to introduce new media s products to markets in the united states for the first time 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
we continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  and have identified revenue recognition  the allowance 
table of contents for doubtful accounts  capitalized product development costs  the valuation of our deferred income taxes  and the valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and identified intangible assets as the critical accounting policies and estimates that are significant to the financial statement presentation and that require difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on these and other accounting policies and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether collectibility can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable 
in addition  our transactions often consist of multiple element arrangements  which must be analyzed to determine the relative fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended and modified  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we license software under non cancelable license and subscription agreements 
we also provide related professional services  including consulting  training  and implementation services  as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
consulting  training  and implementation services are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
accordingly  revenues from these services are recognized separately 
revenue from the sale of courseware licenses is recognized upon meeting the following criteria i a written customer order has been executed  ii courseware has been delivered  iii the license fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility of the fee is probable 
for software arrangements that include more than one element  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the relative fair value of each deliverable 
vsoe is determined using the price charged when that element is sold separately 
for software arrangements in which we do not have vsoe for undelivered elements  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when vsoe is determined for the undelivered elements or when all elements for which we do not have vsoe have been delivered 
if collectibility of the fee is not probable  revenue is recognized as payments are received from the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as the payments become due provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
subscription revenue  primarily fees charged for our plato web learning network and plato orion products  is recognized on a ratable basis as the products are delivered over the subscription period 
services revenue consists of software support and maintenance  which is deferred and recognized ratably over the support period  and consulting  training and implementation services  which are recognized as the services are performed 
other revenue  primarily from hardware and third party software products  is recognized as the products are delivered and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectibility of specific accounts  historical experience and the aging of the trade and installment accounts receivable 
bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
the assumptions and estimates used to determine the allowance are subject to constant revision and involve significant judgment 
the primary factors that impact these assumptions include the efficiency and effectiveness of our billing and collection functions  our historical experience and our credit assessment process 
we believe that the current budget difficulties facing many states will not have a significant impact on the collection of our accounts receivable 
however  a change in the underlying conditions contributing to our belief could impact our assessment of collectibility and  therefore  require a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts and the amount of bad debt expense 
actual collection results could differ materially from those estimated and have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations 
our provision for bad debts is based on our historical experience using a detailed analysis of customer specific activity and receivable balances performed on a quarterly basis 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  or of gross accounts receivable  at october   as compared to  or  at october  capitalized product development costs our product development costs relate to the research  development  enhancement  and maintenance of our courseware products 
the amortization of capitalized product development costs is included in cost of revenues related to license fees and subscriptions 
research and development costs  relating principally to the design and development of new products and the routine enhancement and maintenance of existing products  are expensed as incurred 
we capitalize product development costs when the projects under development reach technological feasibility 
a significant portion of our product development costs qualify for capitalization due to the concentration of our development efforts on the content of our courseware 
capitalization ends when a product is available for general release to our customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
we amortize these costs using the greater of a the amount determined by the ratio of the product s current revenue to total expected future revenue  or b the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the product  which is generally three years 
during all periods presented  we used the straight line method to amortize the capitalized costs as this method resulted in greater amortization 
the significant judgment regarding capitalization of product development costs involves the recoverability of capitalized costs 
we evaluate our capitalized costs at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired  to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product 
estimating net realizable value requires us to estimate future revenues and cash flows to be generated by the product and to use judgment in quantifying the amount  if any  to be written off 
actual cash flows and amounts realized from the courseware products could differ materially from those estimated 
in addition  any future changes to our courseware product offerings could result in write offs of previously capitalized costs and have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations 
valuation of deferred income taxes we account for deferred income taxes based upon differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
the measurement of deferred taxes is adjusted by a valuation allowance  if necessary  to recognize the extent to which the future tax benefits will be recognized 
at october   our deferred tax assets were fully reserved 
approximately  of the gross deferred tax asset relates to our net operating loss carryforwards in the united states us of approximately  which expire in varying amounts between and also included in our gross deferred tax asset was  for our net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  related to our foreign subsidiaries 
we have provided a full valuation allowance related to these foreign deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty in realization of future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions 

table of contents realization of our us deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the us prior to expiration of these loss carryforwards 
our merger with lightspan in the first quarter of fiscal impacted our assessment of the realization of deferred tax assets because the merged company is considered one consolidated taxable entity 
as a result of the merger  we acquired approximately  of lightspan s net operating loss carryforwards 
based on a preliminary section limitation analysis  the usage of these net operating loss carryforwards is limited to approximately  per year and  therefore  approximately  of the acquired net operating loss carryforwards are available to the combined entity 
these amounts are preliminary and may change as the section limitation analysis is completed and analysis of recent announcements by the internal revenue service is taken into account 
the combined net operating loss carryforwards at the acquisition date  which represent the majority of the merged company s deferred tax assets at that date  have been reviewed for realization primarily based upon historical results and secondarily upon projected results 
although we expect taxable income in  this expectation is highly dependent on the improvement of market conditions and the continued integration of lightspan 
lightspan has historically incurred significant operating losses which carry more weight than the projected results 
consequently our historical combined operating results were insufficient to support the combined post merger deferred tax assets 
as a result  net deferred tax assets  excluding the deferred tax liability relating to tax deductible goodwill  which cannot be used to support realization of the other net deferred tax assets  were fully reserved for in the purchase accounting for the lightspan acquisition in the first quarter of thereby increasing goodwill 
any subsequent reversal of the valuation allowance recorded on the combined entity s pre acquisition deferred tax assets will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill  as opposed to recording an income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
a similar analysis and judgment has resulted in a full valuation allowance being placed on the deferred tax assets generated subsequent to the acquisition of lightspan 
goodwill and identified intangible assets we record our acquisitions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
we allocate the cost of acquired companies to the tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology  are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives  while in process research and development  if any  is recorded as a one time charge at the acquisition date 
most of the companies we have acquired have not had significant tangible assets and  as a result  the majority of the purchase price has typically been allocated to identified intangible assets and or goodwill  which increases future amortization expense of identified intangible assets and the potential for impairment charges that we may incur 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets may have a significant impact on our future operating results 
in addition  the allocation of the purchase price requires that we make significant assumptions and estimates  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
should different conditions prevail  we may have to record impairment charges  which may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized to expense and must be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the first step of the impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we operate as one reporting unit and therefore compare our book value to market value market capitalization plus a control premium 
if our fair value exceeds our book value  our goodwill is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if our book value exceeds our market value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for this step the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with the book value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair 
table of contents value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment assessments as of october  and goodwill was not impaired and no impairment charge was recorded 
acquisitions our acquisition strategy is to acquire complementary products or businesses that will enable us to achieve our strategic goals  including market leadership  growth rates that exceed the market  and providing innovative  leading  and distinct products and services 
since  and as of october   we have made the following acquisitions purchase company date reason price cybered  inc july science products  wasatch interactive learning corporation april elementary products  teachmaster technologies  inc september standards based products and services  netschools corporation may web based curriculum and instructional management delivery platform  learningelements  inc august elementary reading products  lightspan  inc november educational software and online assessment products and services  new media holdings limited december secondary science and math products  the revenue contribution from these acquisitions is discussed in more detail below refer to the revenue section in results of operations

our management views these non gaap financial measures to be helpful in assessing our progress in integrating the operations of lightspan 
in addition  these non gaap financial measures facilitate internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors operating results 
we include these non gaap financial measures because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency related to supplemental information used by our management in its financial and operational analysis 
investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non gaap financial measures used herein to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures as provided with our consolidated financial statements

license fees revenues  as a percentage of total revenues both as reported and pro forma  decreased in from  reflecting a shift towards subscriptions and services revenues as discussed below 
we also continue to feel the effects of federal funding delays and economic uncertainties  particularly state budget difficulties  which has impacted the level of purchasing done by our customers 
while there continues to be some improvement in the flow of federal funds to education  as evidenced by the increases in pro forma license fees revenue  these conditions  as well as the shift towards subscriptions and services revenues  are expected to continue to impact our revenues during revenues from license fees  as reported  decreased to  for from  for this was primarily due to the factors discussed above 
as a percentage of total revenues  license fees revenues were for  down from for  reflecting the increase in subscriptions and services revenues as discussed below 
subscriptions the following table presents subscriptions revenues  as reported and on a pro forma basis  as if lightspan revenues prior to the acquisition had been included for all periods presented of of subscriptions revenues revenue revenue change plato as reported lightspan pre acquisition pro forma reported revenues from subscriptions increased for  as compared to  primarily due to the lightspan acquisition and secondarily due to the growth in plato subscriptions revenue 
this also contributed to the growth in pro forma subscriptions revenues in we continue to experience an increasing shift away from perpetual license sales and a growing customer desire to license our products on a subscription basis 
orders for our subscription based products continue to grow  and  while this has a negative impact on revenues in the short term  it has positive implications for the longer term  including increasing deferred revenue balances and greater predictability of future revenues 
this growth trend is further demonstrated by the increase in subscriptions revenues as a percentage of total revenues  both as reported and on a pro forma basis  for compared to revenues from subscriptions  as reported  increased to  for from  for this was primarily due to the factors discussed above 
as a percentage of total revenues  subscriptions revenues were for  up from for

the elementary grade products acquired from lightspan run on sony playstation game consoles  which  along with the sale of related accessories  are a component of other revenues 
other revenue is not expected to be a focus for us in the future or represent a significant component of total revenues 
other revenues  as reported  increased to  for from  for as a percentage of total revenues  other revenues were for and for these revenue increases were primarily due to an increased level of hardware sales  resulting from an assumed netschools contract 
backlog our deferred revenue was  and  at october  and  respectively 
deferred revenue excludes amounts that we expect to earn in the future from the us department of the navy contract approximately  and the idaho department of education contract approximately 
ultimate realization of these contracts is dependent on delivery of services  accomplishment of milestones  and customer acceptance 
in a recent development  the albertson foundation issued a press release stating that the idaho student information management system project is under review due to the increasing costs of that project 
it is too early to know what  if any  impact this will have on our portion of the project 

table of contents in addition  at october   we have orders for approximately  of products and services from multiple customers that have not met various revenue recognition criteria and for which we are not yet able to bill customers 
no assurances exist regarding when or if revenue will be recorded or customers will be billed for these products or services 
all contracts and agreements are subject to the delivery of products and services  collection and other conditions 
outlook we expect total revenues to grow approximately four to seven percent in over higher growth rates are expected to continue for subscriptions and services revenue  while the license fees growth rate and the amount of other revenues are expected to decline from the pro forma levels in total revenues are expected to be at or slightly below levels for the first and second quarters of with growth occurring in the second half of the year

amortization of capitalized product development costs  a component of cost of revenues related to license fees and subscriptions  was  and  for and  respectively 
amortization has increased as projects completed during prior periods are now being amortized to expense 
we expect this amortization to increase in as additional products are completed 
capitalized development costs were  and  for and  respectively 
the increase in capitalized product development costs was primarily due to costs capitalized for new media products since acquisition 
a comparison of gross profit margin by revenue category as reported and on a pro forma basis  as if lightspan revenues and cost of revenues prior to the acquisition had been included for all periods presented  is as follows revenue category as reported pro forma as reported pro forma license fees subscriptions services other total the decrease in pro forma gross profit margin from to resulted primarily from the higher proportion of subscriptions  services  and other revenues included in our product sales mix in  which carry lower margins  and the increased amortization of capitalized product development costs and amortization of

future gross profit margin will be dependent primarily on our revenue mix  the amount of professional development expenses required to provide our services  and amortization of capitalized product development costs and acquired technology 
total cost of revenues  as reported  increased to  for from  for these increases were primarily due to the changes in revenue discussed above  and increased professional development expenses of  increased amortization of capitalized product development costs of  increased amortization of acquired technology of and increased costs related to hardware revenue of  amortization of previously capitalized product development costs  a component of cost of sales  was  and  for and  respectively

outlook total gross profit margin for is expected to be similar to the margin in  with improvement gained from the expected decrease in other revenues offset by the expected increased mix of subscriptions and services revenues and additional investments in our professional services infrastructure 
operating expenses sales and marketing the following table presents sales and marketing expenses  as reported and on a pro forma basis  as if lightspan expenses prior to the acquisition had been included for all periods presented of of sales and marketing revenue revenue change plato as reported lightspan pre acquisition pro forma sales and marketing expenses  as reported  increased for  as compared to  due primarily to the lightspan acquisition 
as a percentage of total revenues  however  both reported and pro forma sales and marketing expenses decreased  reflecting the benefits of the cost reduction plan implemented at the time of the acquisition as well as the synergistic benefits received from combining the plato learning and lightspan sales and marketing activities 
our ability to continue to leverage our cost structure and improve profitability is primarily dependent on our ability to generate higher revenues  integrate our acquisitions and realize sales and marketing productivity improvements 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses  as reported  increased to  for from  for as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses were for  down from for sales and marketing expenses increased in due to a number of factors  including increased commissions resulting from the growth in revenue  increased headcount from the netschools acquisition in the second half of  additional investment in sales and marketing on the east coast of the united states  increased marketing costs necessary to generate our future revenue growth  and additions to our infrastructure necessary to grow our business over the long term 
general and administrative the following table presents general and administrative expenses  as reported and on a pro forma basis  as if lightspan expenses prior to the acquisition had been included for all periods presented of of general and administrative revenue revenue change plato as reported lightspan pre acquisition pro forma general and administrative expenses  as reported  increased for  as compared to  due primarily to the lightspan acquisition 
pro forma general and administrative expenses were comparable in and  however  they decreased as a percentage of revenue reflecting the benefits of the cost reduction plan implemented at the time of the acquisition as well as the synergistic benefits received from combining the plato learning and lightspan general and administrative activities 
general and administrative expenses  as reported  increased to  for from  for as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were for  down from for the increased general and administrative expenses for resulted from a number of factors  including increased headcount from the netschools acquisition in the second half of  increased insurance and professional services costs resulting from the changing regulatory environment  and additions to our infrastructure  including the installation of a new enterprise resource planning system  and  most recently  a customer relationship management crm system  which will help grow our business over the long term 
we believe the benefits from this infrastructure investment will increase controls and generate increased revenues in the future 
product development the majority of our product development costs are required to be capitalized 
product development expense does not reflect these capitalized costs  as they are amortized through cost of revenues 
accordingly  our product development expense  as a percentage of revenue  does not demonstrate our total level of development activity 
the following table presents product development expenses  as reported and on a pro forma basis  as if lightspan expenses prior to the acquisition had been included for all periods presented of of product development revenue revenue change plato as reported lightspan pre acquisition pro forma 
table of contents product development expenses  as reported  increased for  as compared to  due primarily to the lightspan and new media acquisitions 
the decrease in pro forma product development expense reflects the benefits of the cost reduction plan implemented at the time of the acquisition as well as the synergistic benefits received from combining the plato and lightspan product development activities and the capitalization of approximately  of lightspan related product development costs 
product development spending  before capitalization and amortization  was of total revenues  as reported  for  compared to for while this spending percentage decreased slightly  aided in part by our acquisitions of developed technologies and curriculum content  our spending dollars increased significantly due to new projects undertaken in as part of our growth strategy  we intend to continually introduce new products and product improvements 
the extent of our future product development spending and the amount of our future capitalized product development costs are dependent on our ability to develop and introduce new products and product improvements on a cost effective and timely basis 
product development spending  before capitalization and amortization  was of total revenues  as reported  for  compared to for product development expenses  as reported  decreased to  for from  for as a percentage of total revenues  product development expenses were for  down from for our acquisitions of developed technologies and curriculum content and the completion of several significant projects in contributed to the decrease in product development spending in amortization of intangibles expense for   and represented the amortization of identified intangible assets  other than acquired technology  from our acquisitions 
the increase from to was due primarily to the lightspan acquisition 
acquired technology intangible assets are amortized through cost of revenues 
restructuring charges in may  we replaced our managing director of operations in the uk  and severed relationships with two senior executives our chief operating officer and a co founder of netschools and three other employees 
in december  we reduced the size of our workforce by approximately positions and closed approximately open job requisitions  all in the u 
s  which together represented about of our planned workforce at that time 
these actions were taken in connection with restructuring plans intended to align our cost structure with future expectations 
the consolidated statement of operations for included a restructuring charge of for severance costs related to these actions 
as of october   all of these severance costs had been paid 
purchased in process research and development this charge in represented the write off of in process research and development related to the acquisition of netschools 
outlook total operating expenses  before restructuring and other charges  are expected to decline by four to six percent in compared to this expectation is based on our plans for cost reductions and the reduction of professional services resources deployed in selling activities 
restructuring and other charges are expected to be in the range of  to  other charges will consist primarily of executive termination costs 
interest income and expense and other expense  net interest income was   and for   and  respectively 
the decrease in from was due to lower invested balances at lower interest rates as compared to invested balances decreased due to cash being used for our acquisitions in and our stock repurchases in interest expense was   and for   and  respectively 

table of contents income taxes as discussed earlier in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this management s discussion and analysis  as a result of the lightspan acquisition  the net deferred tax assets as of the acquisition date  excluding the deferred tax liability relating to tax deductible goodwill which cannot be used to support realization of the other net deferred tax assets  were fully reserved for in purchase accounting  thereby increasing goodwill  in the first quarter of any subsequent reversal of the valuation allowance recorded on the combined entity s pre acquisition deferred tax assets will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill  as opposed to recording an income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
we recorded income tax expense of  for  consisting of  for consolidated pre tax earnings of  and related to the tax deductible goodwill mentioned earlier 
the significant expense on our consolidated pre tax earnings is the result of taxable income for our us operations 
we record income tax expense for this income  despite having a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  due to the utilization of pre acquisition deferred tax assets and the requirement to reduce goodwill for the reversal of the related valuation allowance 
we do not recognize a tax benefit for taxable losses for our foreign subsidiaries 
we recorded an income tax benefit of for we recorded income tax expense of for  despite incurring a pretax loss of  due to the impact of the losses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries for which we do not recognize a tax benefit 
our historical effective income tax rate has been highly volatile due to the mix between our us operating results  for which we record income taxes  and our foreign operating results  for which we do not record an income tax benefit due to the uncertainty of realizing these tax benefits in future years in our foreign jurisdictions 
as a result of the lightspan acquisition  and the corresponding recognition of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of both plato and lightspan on the acquisition date  future income tax expense will not be offset by reductions in the valuation allowance related to the pre acquisition deferred tax assets 
any such reductions will be recorded as adjustments to goodwill 
however  income tax expense for future periods will be impacted by any reductions in the valuation allowance related to post acquisition deferred tax assets  for which we have recorded a full valuation allowance at october  our effective income tax rate for future quarters and fiscal years is dependent on the level of profitability in each of the us and our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  even if there is a loss in the us  we expect income tax expense of approximately per year related to tax deductible goodwill 
as goodwill from the netschools acquisition is amortized for tax purposes  the book basis of the goodwill will further exceed the tax basis  resulting in increases to the related deferred tax liability 
we expect this liability to increase by approximately per year and it cannot be used to support realization of the other net deferred tax assets 
we currently expect a consolidated income tax rate of about for the full year the extent of any variance from this expectation is highly dependent on our operating results in each of our us and foreign subsidiaries 
a larger than expected foreign loss  or lower than expected us profit  will likely result in a higher consolidated effective tax rate 
conversely  if our foreign or us subsidiaries are more profitable than planned  our consolidated effective tax rate could decline 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources at october   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of  marketable securities of  net accounts receivable of  and our unused line of credit 
working capital was  and  at october  and  respectively
