we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
overview we have commercialized the first phosphate based lithium ion technology and have brought to market our initial products utilizing this technology 
our mission is to drive the wide adoption of high performance  safe  low cost energy storage systems by drawing on the numerous benefits of our latest battery technology  saphion r  the experience of our management team and the significant market opportunity available to us 
the introduction of lithium ion technology to the market was the result of consumer demand for high energy  small battery solutions to power portable electronic devices 
the battery industry  consequently  focused on high energy solutions at the expense of safety 
additionally  due to safety concerns  lithium ion technology has been limited in adoption to small format applications  such as notebook computers  cell phones  and personal digital assistant devices 
our saphion r technology  a phosphate based cathode material  addresses the need for a safe lithium ion solution  especially in large format applications 
our business plan and strategy focus on the generation of revenue from product sales  while minimizing costs through a manufacturing plan that utilizes partnerships with contract manufacturers and internal manufacturing efforts through our newly formed wholly foreign owned enterprises wfoe s in china 
these wfoe s initiated operations in late fiscal we plan to drive the adoption of our saphion r technology by offering existing and new solutions that differentiate our own products and end users products in both the large format and small format markets 
in addition  we will seek to expand the fields of use of our saphion r technology through the licensing of our intellectual property related to our battery chemistries and manufacturing processes 
to date  we have achieved the following successes in implementing our business plan o proven the feasibility of our technology  o launched new saphion r technology based products  including our n charge tm power system family and our k charge tm power system  and introduced our u charge tm power system family of products  which is intended to be a direct replacement for existing lead acid battery solutions in the market today and serve emerging motive applications  o established relationships with top tier customers across many of the target markets for our products  while continuing to build our brand awareness in multiple channels  o closed and sold our high cost manufacturing facility in northern ireland and established key manufacturing partnerships in asia to facilitate low cost  quality production  o signed an agreement granting tyco electronics power systems  inc the exclusive right to resell our k charge tm power system to its telecommunications and utility customers for a period of three years 
the k charge tm power system will be privately labeled and marketed by tyco electronics under its elite rk brand 
the agreement is conditioned on the product meeting performance criteria and on tyco electronics achieving specific quarterly volume requirements 
since execution of this agreement  our k charge tm product achieved nebs level three certification which resulted in the first order from tyco electronics for field trials 
tyco electronics will provide sales  marketing  technical assistance and customer support 
tyco has initiated field trials of the k charge tm power system with three separate telecommunications companies  o signed an agreement granting gf health products  inc graham field  a manufacturer and distributor of healthcare products  the exclusive right to resell our u charge tm power system in the power wheelchair and medical scooter market in the united states and its territories for three years 
additionally  under the agreement graham field will provide sales and marketing  technical assistance and customer support functions 
product development is ongoing with graham field and a product launch is expected during fiscal  o announced a joint technology development program with segway llc to develop long range battery packs using our saphion r technology for segway s human transporter product 
production of the segway battery packs began in march  and they are currently available through segway s distribution channel  o successfully launched our second generation n charge tm power system  o announced an order by uqm technologies  inc for our u charge tm power system for us air force electric truck applications 
fulfillment of this order is expected during the summer of  and o established two wfoe s in china to serve as our powder production and assembly facilities 
o launched a phosphate based lithium ion power cell 
batteries designed with power cells can be discharged and charged more quickly than batteries designed with energy cells 
this makes them ideal for applications that require powerful bursts rather than slow discharges of energy  such as portable appliances and future generations of hybrid and electric vehicles 
our new saphion r power cell offers significant cycling  weight and longevity benefits over nickel metal hydride nimh and nickel cadmium nicad battery technologies 
in fiscal we were able to achieve several important goals in support of our business strategy 
total revenue grew by as compared to the prior year to million with battery and system sales growing over 
we achieved improvement of our negative gross margin and expanded our development and channel launch of saphion r based products 
we continued our efforts to transition our manufacturing and other operations to china through the establishment and commencement of initial operations of two wholly owned subsidiaries in suzhou  china 
valence s business headquarters is located in austin  texas 
our materials research and development centers are in henderson  nevada and oxford  england 
our european sales and oem manufacturing support center is in mallusk  northern ireland 
our manufacturing and product development centers are in suzhou and shanghai  china 
basis of presentation  critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  and exit costs 
our accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  note  summary of significant accounting policies 
the following further describes the methods and assumptions we use in our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we generate revenues from sales of products including batteries and battery systems  and from licensing fees and royalties per technology license agreements 
product sales are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product shipments that are not recognized as revenue during the period shipped  primarily product shipments to resellers that are subject to right of return  are recorded as deferred revenue and reflected as a liability on our balance sheet 
for reseller shipments where revenue recognition is deferred  we record revenue based upon the reseller supplied reporting of sales to their end customers or their inventory reporting 
for direct customers  we estimate a return rate percentage based upon our historical experience 
we review this estimate on a quarterly basis 
from time to time we provide sales incentives in the form of rebates or other price adjustments  these are recorded as reductions to revenue as incurred 
licensing fees are recognized as revenue upon completion of an executed agreement and delivery of licensed information  if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenues are recognized upon licensee revenue reporting and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
impairment of long lived assets we perform a review of long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
if long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value and is recorded in the period the determination was made 
the estimated cash flows used in our impairment analyses reflect our assumptions about average selling prices  royalties  sales volumes  product costs  operating costs including costs associated with our manufacturing transition to china  disposal costs  and market conditions 
these assumptions are sometimes subjective and may require us to make estimates of matters that are uncertain 
additionally  we use probability weighted scenarios to incorporate the impact of alternative outcomes  where applicable 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note  impairment charge  regarding impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
exit costs we incurred exit costs associated with the closure of our northern ireland manufacturing facility 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we recognize liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities at fair value in the period during which the liability is incurred 
we estimate the liabilities related to exit or disposal activities including lease termination costs  compensation of staff  inventory obsolescence  costs to prepare assets for disposal or sale  and other one time expenses based upon our analysis of individual transaction circumstances  agreements and commitments 
some agreements may be revised  or actual results may be different from costs reasonably estimated at the incurrence of the liability 
in these cases  additional costs or reduced costs are recorded in the period incurred  and differences are disclosed in the footnotes to consolidated financial statements 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities are included in restructuring charges 
contract settlement charge 
since  pursuant to a letter of offer  we received employment and capital grants from the ireland development board  now known as invest northern ireland  or ini  for our former manufacturing facility in mallusk  northern ireland  totaling pound million 
under certain circumstances  ini had the right to reclaim a portion of these grants and had a security interest in the facility s land  building  and equipment 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement with ini pursuant to which ini agreed to release us of all outstanding claims and other obligations owing to ini in connection with grants previously provided 
under the terms of the settlement agreement we agreed to pay ini pound million consisting of a pound million payment in cash and a pound million payment in common stock 
on december   we funded an initial payment of pound  and used the net proceeds from the sale of our northern ireland manufacturing facility to fund an additional pound million 
during q of fiscal  we funded the remaining pound   related to the cash portion of the settlement from the net proceeds from equipment sales 
in addition  in order to fund the pound million common stock payment we issued  shares of common stock  equivalent to per share 
in connection with this final settlement we recorded an additional charge of  during the third quarter of fiscal see notes to consolidated financial statements  note  settlement agreement 
joint venture 
on july   baoding fengfan valence battery company  a joint venture between us and fengfan group  ltd  or fengfan  was formed as a corporation in china 
the purpose of the joint venture was to provide low cost manufacturing of our saphion r lithium ion batteries 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  we were to contribute of the joint venture s registered capital  consisting of capital equipment  a nonexclusive license to its technology  and engineering expertise 
fengfan was to contribute of the joint venture s registered capital  consisting of the cash required to fund the joint venture for the first two years  and also to acquire the land and facility needed for manufacturing operations 
as a result of our ownership of the joint venture  right to name the majority of the joint venture s board of directors and right to name the chief executive officer as of march   our consolidated financial statements included the consolidation of the balance sheet  results of operations and cash flows of the joint venture 
however  during the first quarter of fiscal  a dispute arose between us and our joint venture partner  resulting in a loss of control over the joint venture and our initiation of an action to enforce our rights under the joint venture agreement and  commencing with that quarter we accounted for our investment in the joint venture under the cost method with no further recognition of assets  liabilities  operating results  and cash flows 
on november   we entered into a settlement agreement  or the jv settlement agreement  with baoding fengfan group limited liability company  ltd  or fengfan  and baoding fengfan valence battery company  ltd  or the jv company 
under the terms of the jv settlement agreement  the parties agreed to liquidate and dissolve the jv company  terminate the jv company contracts and fully settle any and all remaining obligations among the parties 
we agreed to make compensation payments to the jv company and to fengfan totaling  and to make equipment purchases from the jv company totaling  to date  we have made compensation payments of  and completed all of the equipment purchases 
the  final compensation payment will be made upon final dissolution of the jv legal entity by fengfan 
we recorded a contract settlement charge of  in the third quarter of fiscal for the compensation payments and capitalized equipment purchases as the payments were made 
results of operations fiscal years ended march  fiscal  march  fiscal and march  fiscal the following table summarizes the results of our operations for the past three fiscal years dollars in thousands march  change march  change march  licensing and royalty revenue battery and system sales    total revenues    gross profit loss    of total revenue restructuring  settlement  contract settlement and impairment charges   of total revenue other operating expenses    of total revenue gain on disposal of assets  of total revenue total operating expenses    of total revenue operating loss    of total revenue net loss    of total revenue revenues and gross margin battery and system sales battery and system sales totaled million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the year ended march   and for the year ended march  the year over year increases in revenue during both fiscal and were primarily driven by the establishment and growth of our retail  reseller and education channels for our n charge tm power system product 
we achieved the largest growth in fiscal sales in education channels accounting for almost million of our total product sales 
product shipments to resellers that are subject to right of return or monies received for exclusivity or future obligations are recorded on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
we had in deferred revenue on our balance sheet at march  as compared to million on march  we expect sales of the n charge tm power system to continue to grow moderately in fiscal we launched our large format products in late with the k charge system and u charge family during fiscal in fiscal  we plan to launch our long range battery pack for use in segway llc s human transporter as well as further expansions of our u charge family of products 
fiscal was largely taken up by customer testing and evaluation of our k charge and u charge products and  as a consequence  we did not record material sales of large form at products during the fiscal year 
we anticipate that many of these customers will complete their evaluation in fiscal  at which time customers will begin to make final purchase decisions 
licensing and royalty revenue for fiscal years through  license and royalty revenue was primarily derived from license fees and royalties payments from amperex technology limited  or atl  including a one time license fee payment of  in fiscal and on going royalty payments as sales are made by atl using our technology 
we expect to continue to pursue a licensing strategy as our saphion r technology receives greater market acceptance 
gross profit loss gross profit loss as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  was for the year ended march  as compared to gross margin of for the fiscal year ended march  and gross margin of for the year ended march  although gross margin has improved  we maintained a negative gross margin on our sales in all periods because of insufficient production and sales volumes to facilitate the coverage of our indirect and fixed manufacturing operating costs 
fiscal year margin improvements were offset by inventory valuation adjustments related to valuation of our work in process cell inventory and lower of cost or market tests for our early launch and us sourced large format products 
we have successfully transitioned our battery manufacturing and n charge tm product assembly operations to contract manufacturers in asia 
as of april  we completed the transition of our powder manufacturing to our wfoes in suzhou  china 
we are transitioning additional manufacturing including pack assembly to our wfoe s in suzhou  china in fiscal we expect cost of sales to continue to decrease during fiscal as a percentage of sales as production volumes continue to increase  as we continue to implement our lower cost manufacturing strategy  and as we launch higher margin products 
operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses during each of the past three fiscal years fiscal year ended dollars in thousands march  change march  change march  operating expenses research and product development    marketing    general and administrative    depreciation and amortization   gain on disposal of assets  restructuring charge contract settlement charge  ini  contract settlement charge  other asset impairment charge  total operating expenses    of total revenue we continued to focus on our operating expense management throughout fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal versus in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease is the result of our focus on expense reductions during fiscal  our final settlement with the ini  the gain on the sale of our mallusk  northern ireland facility  and reduced impairment and depreciation expenses related to our assets as we finalized our transition plans 
the decrease in operating expense as a percent of revenue was offset by increases in general and administrative expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and our relocation of manufacturing and development operations to china as well as settlements of other contracts 
of our operating expenses in fiscal  and  million  million and  respectively  related to the changes in our business plan and subsequent closure of our northern ireland facility and the sale of our henderson  nevada facility  representing  and of revenue in each of these fiscal years 
we expect to continue to improve our operating expenses as a percentage of sales during fiscal through the transfer of additional operations to asia and continued revenue growth 
research and product development 
research and product development expenses consist primarily of personnel  equipment and materials to support our efforts to develop battery chemistry and products  as well as to improve our manufacturing processes 
research and product development expenses totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we achieved year over year decreases in research and development in fiscal and fiscal of and  respectively 
decreases in research and development expenses were the result of cessation of process development work in our northern ireland facility and reductions in research headcount  temporary staff  and consulting expenses and material costs in our henderson  nevada facility 
these decreases were offset by increases in development spending to expand the saphion r family of products 
we expect to continue to achieve reductions in research and product development expenses as we improve our product development efficiency and transition portions of our development efforts to asia 
marketing 
marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales and marketing personnel  public relations and promotional materials 
after expanding our marketing expenses in fiscal to increase staffing  advertising and promotions to support brand awareness and expansion of sales channels for our products  we eliminated the lower performing of these programs and achieved decrease in marketing expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal while achieving over growth in product revenue 
specifically  in fiscal  we reduced expenses related to our n charge power system lead generation and media advertising as well as reduced consulting related to the european market development 
we expect marketing expenses to grow modestly in fiscal as we continue to expand and develop our channels  grow our worldwide sales team  launch additional saphion r products  and continue our branding efforts 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for finance  human resources  facilities  accounting  information technology  legal  and corporate related expenses  including our china initiatives 
general and administrative expenses of million in fiscal represented an increase of  or  over general and administrative expenses in fiscal fiscal year general and administrative expenses of million represented a increase over fiscal expenses 
the year over year increases in general and administrative expense in fiscal and fiscal are caused by our ongoing relocation and establishment of manufacturing and development operations to china  increased costs of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and costs related to shutting down our northern ireland facility 
other costs related to our manufacturing transition impairment charge an impairment charge of  was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal as a result of our decision to relocate manufacturing operations from our leased henderson  nevada facility to a newly formed subsidiary in suzhou  china  equipment and fixtures in the nevada facility would not generate cash flows greater than their carrying value 
assets with a carrying value of approximately  were written down in full to fair value  as we estimate that there will be no future cash flows from these assets 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
the charge was recorded pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we arrived at our decision to transfer manufacturing from our northern ireland facility to low cost manufacturing regions  including china and consequently determined that the carrying value of certain manufacturing assets at our northern ireland facility exceed expected future cash flows from these assets 
additionally  we determined that the future cash flows expected to be generated from certain technology we acquired from telcordia in december did not exceed their carrying value 
the impairment charge was recorded against property  plant  and equipment and intellectual property with a carrying value of million to recognize these assets at their fair value 
fair value was determined based on estimated future cash flows to be generated by these assets  discounted at our market rate of interest of during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of  on our property in henderson  nevada related to the planned sale of this facility 
we estimated that the future cash flows expected from the sale of this facility were less than the asset carrying value and adjusted the assets to their fair value accordingly 
contract settlement charges during fiscal  we recorded contract settlement charges totaling million dollars in thousands fiscal ini settlement joint venture supplier contract terminations total  ini settlement since  pursuant to a letter of offer  we received employment and capital grants from the ireland development board  now known as invest northern ireland  or ini  for our former manufacturing facility located in mallusk  northern ireland  totaling pound million 
under certain circumstances  ini had the right to reclaim a portion of these grants and had a security interest in the facility s land  building  and equipment 
on december   we and ini entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which ini agreed to release us of all outstanding claims and other obligations owing to ini in connection with grants previously provided to us 
under the terms of the settlement agreement we agreed to pay ini pound million consisting of a pound million payment in cash and a pound million payment in common stock 
on december   we funded an initial payment of pound  and used the net proceeds from the sale of our northern ireland manufacturing facility to fund an additional pound million 
during q of fiscal  we funded the remaining pound   related to the cash portion of the settlement from the net proceeds from equipment sales 
in addition  in order to fund the pound million common stock payment  we issued  shares of common stock  equivalent to per share 
in connection with this final settlement  we recorded an additional charge of  during the third quarter of fiscal joint venture settlement on november   we entered into a settlement agreement with baoding fengfan group limited liability company  ltd  or fengfan and baoding fengfan valence battery company  ltd  or the jv company 
under the terms of the jv settlement agreement  the parties agreed to liquidate and dissolve the jv company  terminate the jv company contracts and fully settle any and all remaining obligations among the parties 
we agreed to make compensation payments to the jv company and to fengfan totaling approximately  and to make equipment purchases from the jv company of approximately  to date  we have made compensation payments of  and completed all of the equipment purchases 
the  final compensation payment will be made upon final dissolution of the jv legal entity by fengfan 
we recorded a contract settlement charge of  in the third quarter of fiscal for the compensation payments and capitalized equipment purchases as the payments were made 
supplier contract terminations during the third quarter of fiscal  as a result of our relocating our core operations to china and selection of lower cost suppliers  we terminated two supplier contracts related to producing product and manufacturing capital equipment 
in settlement of these contracts  we expect to pay these suppliers termination fees which include the settlement expenses accrued in fiscal of approximately  restructuring charge 
in the third fiscal quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of  related to the closing of our northern ireland facility 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the transition of our battery production from our northern ireland manufacturing facility to our oem supplier 
all inventory remaining at the conclusion of manufacturing operations was determined to be obsolete and unusable by any of our battery manufacturing sources 
raw materials inventory obsolescence expense of approximately  and work in process inventory obsolescence expense of approximately  were recorded as restructuring charges during the quarter ended december  remaining payment obligations for factory equipment operating leases that extended beyond december  were approximately  these lease payment obligations provide no economic benefit to us  and contractual lease costs of approximately  were recorded as restructuring charges during the quarter ended december  gain on sale of assets gain on sales of the facility and production and development equipment from our former mallusk  northern ireland facility was million in fiscal the majority of the gain is related to the sales of our northern ireland facility completed on december  additionally  we determined that the equipment was not required in our manufacturing and development operations in suzhou  china  and was sold for fair value 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note  property  plant and equipment 
depreciation and amortization  interest expense  and other expenses depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense totaled  million  and million for fiscal years ended march     respectively 
the decrease in depreciation expenses resulted from the assets in our northern ireland facility being classified as held for sale and not depreciated beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the impact of the impairment charges to intellectual property and property  plant  and equipment and the impact of the sale of our henderson  nevada facility 
interest expense 
interest expense relates to mortgages on our northern ireland facility as well as interest on our long term debt to stockholder 
we completed the sale of our northern ireland facility and paid off the mortgages on december  interest expense was million  million and million for the fiscal years    respectively 
cost of warrants 
in november  we agreed to extend the time period in which a warrant holder was able to exercise its warrants 
the warrant exercise period originally ended on july   and was extended to july   at which time the warrants terminated unexercised 
the non cash expense related to the exercise period extension of  was determined using the black scholes model  with risk free rate of  expected life of years  and volatility of 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity at march   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of million and million remaining under the million backup equity funding commitment entered into in june with mr 
carl berg 
subsequent to march  we have drawn down an additional million of this prior commitment 
on june  we entered into a new million funding commitment with mr 
berg to provide funding in the form of equity or a secured loan on terms to be negotiated 
this new commitment can be reduced by mr 
berg by the amount of net proceeds received in a debt or equity transaction with a third party 
at march   we had million of series c convertible preferred stock and million of series c convertible preferred stock outstanding 
the series c convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock are convertible into common stock at per share and are redeemable on december  subject to an early right of redemption in the case of the series c convertible preferred stock during the days following june  and september  
applicable provisions of delaware corporate law restrict our ability to redeem the preferred stock 
if we do not redeem the shares when required by their terms  the conversion price will be reduced to an amount equal to of the lowest closing bid price of our common stock during the three days ending on and including the conversion date 
our current forecast projects that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient for at least the twelve months following march  this forecast assumes product sales during fiscal from the n charge tm power system and the segway pack  which are subject to seasonal fluctuations  of between million per quarter  and expect additional revenues from the sale of the u charge tm power system into large format applications and direct cell sale activities 
we also anticipate further cash benefits from continued reductions in operating expenses and manufacturing costs  offset by small increases to capital expenditures associated with continuing efforts in china 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our operations  including the failure to achieve expected revenues  greater than expected expenses  changes in oem relationships  market conditions  the failure to timely realize our product development goals  and other adverse developments 
these events could have a negative impact on our available liquidity sources during fiscal the following table summarizes our statement of cash flows for the fiscal years ended march    and dollars in thousands march  march  march  net cash flows provided by used in operating activities    investing activities   financing activities    effect of foreign exchange rates net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   our use of cash from operations during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal was million   and million  respectively 
the cash used for operating activities during all periods was primarily for operating losses and working capital 
cash used for operating loss in fiscal was higher than in fiscal primarily from the impact of contract settlement agreements and increases in some of the operating expenses as described above in the section titled operating expenses offset by reductions in gross profit loss 
in fiscal  we received net cash from investing activities of million 
the cash provided from investing activities during fiscal related primarily to the sale of our northern ireland facility as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  note  property  plant  and equipment  and offset by purchases of property  plant and equipment  primarily for enterprise software and manufacturing fixtures and our investment in our china subsidiaries 
during fiscal  the effect of deconsolidation of our china joint venture  as described in notes to consolidated financial statements  note  joint venture  was to reduce cash by  as the assets  liabilities  and operating results of the joint venture are no longer being consolidated into our financial statements 
during fiscal  purchases of property  plant and equipment in our joint venture were offset by our sale of the henderson  nevada facility resulting in million using in investing activities 
we obtained net cash from financing activities of million and million during the fiscal and  respectively 
the financing included million from our berg berg equity lines  net proceeds from the sale common stock to a third party institutional investor  and less cash used for the payoff of long term debt related to the sale of our northern ireland facility 
as a result of the above  we had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  during fiscal  a net decrease of during fiscal  and a net increase of million during fiscal related party transactions in june of  we entered into a million funding commitment with mr 
carl berg 
the commitment is to provide funding in the form of equity or a secured loan on terms to be negotiated 
this new commitment can be reduced by mr 
berg by the amount of net proceeds received in a debt or equity transaction with a third party 
in june of  we entered into a million backup equity funding commitment with mr 
carl berg 
the commitment allows us to request mr 
berg or an affiliate company to purchase shares of common stock from time to time at the average closing bid price of the stock for the five days prior to the purchase date 
this commitment can be reduced by mr 
berg by the amount of net proceeds received by us from the sale of building or equipment from our mallusk  northern ireland facility or the amount of net proceeds in a debt or equity transaction  and may be increased if necessary under certain circumstances 
since june  we have received net proceeds from these transactions in an aggregate amount equal to million 
as of the date hereof  mr 
berg has not requested that his commitment be reduced by this amount 
as of march   there was million available on this commitment and we have subsequently drawn down million of this remaining committed amount 
on june   berg berg  an affiliate of carl berg  a director and principal shareholder of ours  committed to provide us million in fiscal  increasing its total available remaining financing commitments to million million under this new financing commitment and million under a then existing commitment 
berg berg agreed to fund the million commitments by purchasing shares of common stock from time to time as requested by us at the then current market price 
at march   we had fully utilized this financing commitment 
in march  we obtained a million equity line of credit with berg berg 
at december   the equity line was fully drawn 
this commitment was approved by stockholders at our annual meeting held on august  in exchange for the amounts funded pursuant to this agreement  we have issued to berg berg restricted common stock at of the average closing price of the company s common stock over the five trading days prior to the purchase date 
we agreed to register any shares we issued to berg berg under this commitment 
on january   we granted options to mr 
dawson  the company s then chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president  an incentive stock option to purchase  shares  which was granted pursuant to our plan the plan 
also  an option to purchase  shares was granted pursuant to our plan and an option to purchase  shares was granted outside of any of our equity plans  neither of which were incentive stock options the nonstatutory options 
the exercise price of all three options is per share  the fair market value on the date of the grant 
our compensation committee approved the early exercise of the nonstatutory options on march  the options permitted exercise by cash  shares  full recourse notes or non recourse notes secured by independent collateral 
the nonstatutory options were exercised on march  with non recourse promissory notes in the amounts of  dawson note one and  dawson note two collectively  the dawson notes secured by the shares acquired upon exercise plus  shares previously held by mr 
dawson

in accordance with the dawson notes  interest is payable annually in arrears and has been paid through march  capital commitments and debt at march   we had commitments for capital expenditures for the next months of approximately  relating to the implementation of our enterprise software system 
we may require additional capital expenditures in order to meet greater demand levels for our products than are currently anticipated and or to support our transition of operations to china 
our cash obligations for short term and long term debt  net of unaccreted discount consisted of dollars in thousands march  long term debt to berg berg  long term debt to berg berg  interest on long term debt  total long term debt  repayment obligations of short term and long term debt principal are thereafter total dollars in thousands principal repayment   if not converted to common stock prior to maturity  the redemption obligation for the series c and series c preferred stock is million on december  if the shares are not redeemed in accordance with their terms  the holder of the preferred stock shall have the option to require that we convert all or part of the redeemed shares at a share price of of the lowest closing bid price of our common stock during the three days ending on and including the conversion date 
if cash flow from operations is not adequate to meet debt obligations  additional debt or equity financing will be required 
there can be no assurance that we could obtain the additional financing 
inflation historically  our operations have not been materially affected by inflation 
however  our operations may be affected by inflation in the future

the provision is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
sfas no 
requires exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at fair value  rather than at carryover basis  unless neither the asset received nor the asset surrendered has a fair value that is determinable within reasonable limits or the transactions lack commercial substance 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb released its final revised standard  sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that an entity measure the cost of equity based service awards using the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
an entity will initially measure the cost of liability based service awards using its current fair value  the fair value of that award will be re measured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
adoption of sfas no 
r is required for fiscal periods beginning after june  the company is evaluating sfas r and believes that it will likely have a material effect on its financial position and results of operations 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of march   our scheduled principal  interest and other contractual annual cash obligations due for each of the periods indicated below in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total one year years years years long term debt obligations   operating lease obligations   purchase obligations   total    risk factors cautionary statements and risk factors several of the matters discussed in this report contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
factors associated with the forward looking statements that could cause actual results to differ from those projected or forecasted in this report are included in the statements below 
in addition to other information contained in this report  you should carefully consider the following cautionary statements and risk factors 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could suffer 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
risks related to our business we may be required to raise additional debt or equity financing to execute our business plan 
at march   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of million and million remaining under the million backup equity funding commitment entered into in june with mr 
carl berg 
subsequent to march  we have drawn down an additional million of this prior commitment 
on june  we entered into a new million funding commitment with mr 
berg to provide funding in the form of equity or a secured loan on terms to be negotiated 
this new commitment can be reduced by mr 
berg by the amount of net proceeds received in a debt or equity transaction with a third party 
at march   we had million of series c convertible preferred stock and million of series c convertible preferred stock outstanding 
the series c convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock are convertible into common stock at per share and are redeemable on december  subject to an early right of redemption in the case of the series c convertible preferred stock during the days following june  and september  
applicable provisions of delaware corporate law restrict our ability to redeem the preferred stock 
if we do not redeem the shares when required by their terms  the conversion price will be reduced to an amount equal to of the lowest closing bid price of our common stock during the three days ending on and including the conversion date 
our current forecast projects that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient for at least the twelve months following march  this forecast assumes product sales during fiscal from the n charge tm power system and the segway pack  which are subject to seasonal fluctuations  of between million per quarter  and expect additional revenues from the sale of the u charge tm power system into large format applications and direct cell sale activities 
we also anticipate further cash benefits from continued reductions in operating expenses and manufacturing costs  offset by small increases to capital expenditures associated with continuing efforts in china 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our operations  including the failure to achieve expected revenues  greater than expected expenses  changes in oem relationships  market conditions  the failure to timely realize our product development goals  and other adverse developments 
these events could have a negative impact on our available liquidity sources during the next months 
our limited financial resources could materially affect our business and our ability to commercially exploit our technology 
limited financial resources can adversely affect our ability to respond to unanticipated developments and place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors 
currently  we do not have sufficient sales and gross profit to generate the cash flows required to meet our operating and capital needs 
nor do we have committed financing to provide for our operations for more than the next twelve months 
as a consequence  one of our primary objectives has been to reduce expenses and overhead and thus limiting the resources available to the development and commercialization of our technology 
our limited financial resources could materially affect our ability  and the pace at which  we are able to commercially exploit our saphion r technology 
for example  it could o limit the research and development resources we are able to commit to the further development of our technology and the development of products that can be commercially exploited in our marketplace  o limit the sales and marketing resources that we are able to commit to the marketing of our technology  o have an adverse impact on our ability to attract top tier companies as our technology and marketing partners  o have an adverse impact on our ability to employ and retain qualified employees with the skills and expertise necessary to implement our business plan  o make us more vulnerable to failure to achieve our forecasted results  economic downturns  adverse industry conditions or catastrophic external events  o limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing business and economic conditions  and o place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have greater financial resources than we have 
we have a history of losses  have an accumulated deficit and may never achieve or sustain significant revenues or profitability 
we have incurred operating losses each year since our inception in and had an accumulated deficit of million as of march  we had negative working capital of million as of march   and have sustained recurring losses related primarily to the research and development and marketing of our products combined with the lack of sufficient sales to provide for these needs 
we may continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows during fiscal we may never achieve or sustain sufficient revenues or profitability in the future 
if we continue to experience significant losses we may be unable to maintain sufficient liquidity to provide for our operating needs 
we reported a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  and a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  if we cannot achieve a competitive cost structure  achieve profitability and access the capital markets on acceptable terms  we will be unable to fund our obligations and sustain our operations 
our working capital requirements may increase beyond those currently anticipated 
we have planned for an increase in sales and  if we experience sales in excess of our plan  our working capital needs and capital expenditures would likely increase from that currently anticipated 
our ability to meet this additional customer demand would depend on our ability to arrange for additional equity or debt financing since it is likely that cash flow from sales will lag behind these increased working capital requirements 
our indebtedness and other obligations are substantial and could materially affect our business and our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs 
we have now and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness and other obligations 
as of march   we had approximately million of total consolidated indebtedness 
our substantial indebtedness and other obligations could negatively impact our operations in the future 
for example  it could o limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes  o require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes  o make us more vulnerable to failure to achieve our forecasted results  economic downturns  adverse industry conditions or catastrophic external events  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing business and economic conditions  and o place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have relatively less debt than we have 
all of our assets are pledged as collateral under our loan agreements 
our failure to meet the obligations under our loan agreements could result in foreclosure of our assets 
all of our assets are pledged as collateral under various loan agreements 
if we fail to meet our obligations pursuant to these loan agreements  our lenders may declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest 
if this were to occur  we would not have the financial resources to repay our debt and these lenders could proceed against our assets 
our business will be adversely affected if our saphion r technology batteries are not commercially accepted 
we are researching and developing batteries based upon phosphate chemistry 
our batteries are designed and manufactured as components for other companies and end user customers 
our success depends on the acceptance of our batteries and the products using our batteries in their markets 
we may have technical issues that arise that may affect the acceptance of our products by our customers 
market acceptance may also depend on a variety of other factors  including educating the target market regarding the benefits of our products 
market acceptance and market share are also affected by the timing of market introduction of competitive products 
if our customers or we are unable to gain any significant market acceptance for saphion r technology based batteries  our business will be adversely affected 
it is too early to determine if saphion r technology based batteries will achieve significant market acceptance 
if we are unable to develop  manufacture and market products that gain wide customer acceptance  our business will be adversely affected 
the process of developing our products is complex and uncertain  and failure to anticipate customers changing needs and to develop products that receive widespread customer acceptance could significantly harm our results of operations 
we must make long term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will eventually result in products that the market will accept 
after a product is developed  we must be able to manufacture sufficient volumes quickly and at low costs 
to accomplish this  we must accurately forecast volumes  mix of products and configurations that meet customer requirements  and we may not succeed 
if our products fail to perform as expected  we could lose existing and future business  and our ability to develop  market and sell our batteries could be harmed 
if our products when introduced do not perform as expected  our reputation could be severely damaged  and we could lose existing or potential future business 
this performance failure may have the long term effect of harming our ability to develop  market and sell our products 
in addition to being used in our own product lines  our cells are intended to be incorporated into other products 
if we do not form effective arrangements with oems to commercialize these products  our profitability could be impaired 
our business strategy contemplates that we will be required to rely on assistance from oems to gain market acceptance for our products 
we therefore will need to identify acceptable oems and enter into agreements with them 
once we identify acceptable oems and enter into agreements with them  we will need to meet these companies requirements by developing and introducing new products and enhanced or modified versions of our existing products on a timely basis 
oems often require unique configurations or custom designs for batteries  which must be developed and integrated into their product well before the product is launched 
this development process not only requires substantial lead time between the commencement of design efforts for a customized power system and the commencement of volume shipments of the power system to the customer  but also requires the cooperation and assistance of the oems for purposes of determining the requirements for each specific application 
we may have technical issues that arise that may affect the acceptance of our products by oems 
if we are unable to design  develop  and introduce products that meet oems requirements  we may lose opportunities to enter into additional purchase orders and our reputation may be damaged 
as a result  we may not receive adequate assistance from oems or pack assemblers to successfully commercialize our products  which could impair our profitability 
we depend on a small number of customers for our revenues  and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we were to lose the business of any one of them 
to date  our existing purchase orders in commercial quantities are from a limited number of customers 
during fiscal  three customers  d h distributors  pc connection  and best buy accounted for a combined of our revenue 
during fiscal  best buy accounted for of revenue 
during fiscal  two customers  alliant techsystems inc and pabion corporation  ltd  each accounted for more than of total revenues 
we anticipate that sales of our products to a limited number of key customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our customers and do not expect to enter into any long term agreements in the near future 
as a result  we face the substantial risk that one or more of the following events could occur o reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from a customer  o development by a customer of other sources of supply  o selection by a customer of devices manufactured by one of our competitors for inclusion in future product generations  o loss of a customer or a disruption in our sales and distribution channels  or o failure of a customer to make timely payment of our invoices 
if we were to lose one or more customers  or if we were to lose revenues due to a customer s inability or refusal to continue to purchase our batteries  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
the fact that we depend on a sole source supplier or a limited number of suppliers for key raw materials may delay our production of batteries 
we depend on a sole source supplier or a limited number of suppliers for certain key raw materials used in manufacturing and developing our power systems 
we generally purchase raw materials pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time and have no long term contracts or other guaranteed supply arrangements with our sole or limited source suppliers 
as a result  our suppliers may not be able to meet our requirements relative to specifications and volumes for key raw materials  and we may not be able to locate alternative sources of supply at an acceptable cost 
in the past  we have experienced delays in product development due to the delivery of nonconforming raw materials from our suppliers 
if in the future we are unable to obtain high quality raw materials in sufficient quantities on competitive pricing terms and on a timely basis  it may delay battery production  impede our ability to fulfill existing or future purchase orders and harm our reputation and profitability 
we have four key executives  the loss of any of which could harm our business 
without qualified executives  we face the risk that we will not be able to effectively run our business on a day to day basis or execute our long term business plan 
we do not have key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our key members of management 
our oxide based batteries  which now comprise a small portion of our available products  contain potentially dangerous materials  which could expose us to product liability claims 
in the event of a short circuit or other physical damage to an oxide based battery  a reaction may result with excess heat or a gas being generated and released 
if the heat or gas is not properly released  the battery may be flammable or potentially explosive 
we could  therefore  be exposed to possible product liability litigation 
in addition  our batteries incorporate potentially dangerous materials  including lithium 
it is possible that these materials may require special handling or those safety problems may develop in the future 
if the amounts of active materials in our batteries are not properly balanced and if the charge discharge system is not properly managed  a dangerous situation may result 
battery pack assemblers using batteries incorporating technology similar to ours include special safety circuitry within the battery to prevent such a dangerous condition 
we expect that our customers will have to use a similar type of circuitry in connection with their use of our oxide based products 
we expect to sell a significant portion of our products to and derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from customers located outside the united states 
foreign government regulations  currency fluctuations and increased costs associated with international sales could make our products and licenses unaffordable in foreign markets  which would reduce our future profitability 
we expect that international sales of our products and licenses  as well as licensing royalties  represent a significant portion of our sales potential 
international business can be subject to many inherent risks that are difficult or impossible for us to predict or control  including o changes in foreign government regulations and technical standards  including additional regulation of rechargeable batteries  technology  or the transport of lithium and phosphate  which may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell or license in certain markets  o foreign governments may impose tariffs  quotas  and taxes on our batteries or our import of technology into their countries  o requirements or preferences of foreign nations for domestic products could reduce demand for our batteries and our technology  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar could make our batteries and our technology unaffordable to foreign purchasers and licensees or more expensive compared to those of foreign manufacturers and licensors  o longer payment cycles typically associated with international sales and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable may reduce the future profitability of foreign sales and royalties  o import and export licensing requirements in china or other countries where we intend to conduct business may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell or license in certain markets  and o political and economic instability in china or other countries where we intend to conduct business may reduce the demand for our batteries and our technology or our ability to market our batteries and our technology in those countries 
these risks may increase our costs of doing business internationally and reduce our sales and royalties or future profitability 
we may need to expand our employee base and operations in order to effectively distribute our products commercially  which may strain our management and resources and could harm our business 
to implement our growth strategy successfully  we will have to increase our staff  primarily with personnel in sales  marketing  and product support capabilities  as well as third party and direct distribution channels 
however  we face the risk that we may not be able to attract new employees to sufficiently increase our staff or product support capabilities  or that we will not be successful in our sales and marketing efforts 
failure in any of these areas could impair our ability to execute our plans for growth and adversely affect our future profitability 
competition for personnel  in particular for product development and product implementation personnel  is intense  and we may have difficulty attracting the personnel necessary to effectively operate our business 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  and marketing personnel who are familiar with and experienced in the battery industry 
if we cannot attract and retain experienced sales and marketing executives  we may not achieve the visibility in the marketplace that we need to obtain purchase orders  which would have the result of lowering our sales and earnings 
we compete in the market for personnel against numerous companies  including larger  more established competitors who have significantly greater financial resources than we do 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the skilled personnel necessary to operate our business effectively in the future 
if we are sued on a product liability claim  our insurance policies may not be sufficient 
although we maintain general liability insurance and product liability insurance  our insurance may not cover all potential types of product liability claims to which manufacturers are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could harm our business 
our failure to cost effectively manufacture batteries in commercial quantities  which satisfy our customers product specifications  could damage our customer relationships and result in significant lost business opportunities for us 
to be successful  we must cost effectively manufacture commercial quantities of our batteries that meet customer specifications 
to facilitate commercialization of our products  we will need to further reduce our manufacturing costs  which we intend to do through the effective utilization of manufacturing partners 
we currently manufacture our batteries and assemble our products in china and taiwan 
we intend to transition additional operations to asia over the course of fiscal as a consequence  we are dependent on the performance of our manufacturing partners to manufacture and deliver our products to our customers 
if any of our manufacturing partners is unable to continue to manufacture product in commercial quantities on a timely and efficient basis  we could lose customers and adversely impact our ability to attract future customers 
our patent applications may not result in issued patents  which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercially exploit our products 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until the patents issue or are published 
since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months  we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on these inventions 
we also cannot be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford protection against a competitor 
in addition  patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws  rules and procedures that differ from those of the united states  and thus we cannot be certain that foreign patent applications related to issued us patents will issue 
furthermore  if these patent applications issue  some foreign countries provide significantly less effective patent enforcement than in the united states 
the status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will result in patents being issued  or that our patents and any patents that may be issued to us in the future will afford protection against competitors with similar technology 
in addition  patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around  either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our operations 
if we cannot protect or enforce our existing intellectual property rights or if our pending patent applications do not result in issued patents  we may lose the advantages of our research and manufacturing systems 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on whether we can protect our existing proprietary technology and manufacturing processes 
we rely on a combination of patent and trade secret protection  non disclosure agreements and cross licensing agreements 
these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the proprietary technology underlying our batteries 
employees  consultants  and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their non disclosure agreements with us  and we may not have adequate remedies in the event of their breaches 
in addition  our competitors may be able to develop products that are equal or superior to our products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights 
we currently manufacture and export some of our products from china 
the legal regime protecting intellectual property rights in china is weak 
because the chinese legal system in general  and the intellectual property regime in particular  are relatively weak  it is often difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in china 
in addition  there are other countries where effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited 
accordingly  we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights outside of the united states 
we have established a program for intellectual property documentation and protection in order to safeguard our technology base 
we intend to vigorously pursue enforcement and defense of our patents and our other proprietary rights 
we could incur significant expenses in preserving our proprietary rights  and these costs could harm our financial condition 
we also are attempting to expand our intellectual property rights through our applications for new patents 
we cannot be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that our issued patents will afford us protection against a competitor 
our inability to protect our existing proprietary technologies or to develop new proprietary technologies may substantially impair our financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could be time consuming and expensive to defend  and if any of our products or processes is found to be infringing  we may not be able to procure licenses to use patents necessary to our business at reasonable terms  if at all 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
while we currently are not engaged in any intellectual property litigation or proceedings  we may become involved in these proceedings in the future 
in the future we may be subject to claims or inquiries regarding our alleged unauthorized use of a third party s intellectual property 
an adverse outcome in litigation could force us to do one or more of the following o stop selling  incorporating  or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property  o pay significant damages to third parties  o obtain from the owners of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or o redesign those products or manufacturing processes that use the infringed technology  which may not be economically or technologically feasible 
whether or not an intellectual property litigation claim is valid  the cost of responding to it  in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources  could be expensive and harm our business 
risks associated with doing business in china since our products are manufactured in china and we intend to transfer additional operations to china  we face risks if china loses normal trade relations with the united states 
we manufacture and export our products from china 
our products sold in the united states are currently not subject to us import duties 
on september   the united states senate voted to permanently normalize trade with china  which provides a favorable category of united states import duties 
in addition  on december  china was accepted into the world trade organization wto  a global international organization of countries that regulates international trade 
as a result of opposition to certain policies of the chinese government and china s growing trade surpluses with the united states  there has been  and in the future may be  opposition to the extension of normal trade relations  or ntr  status for china 
the loss of ntr status for china  changes in current tariff structures or adoption in the unites states of other trade policies adverse to china could have an adverse effect on our business 
because the chinese legal system in general  and the intellectual property regime in particular  are relatively weak  we may not be able to enforce intellectual property rights in china and elsewhere 
we currently manufacture and export some of our products from china 
the legal regime protecting intellectual property rights in china is weak 
because the chinese legal system in general  and the intellectual property regime in particular  are relatively weak  it is often difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in china 
in addition  there are other countries where effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited 
accordingly  we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights outside of the united states 
enforcing agreements and laws in china is difficult or may be impossible as china does not have a comprehensive system of laws 
we are dependent on our agreements with our chinese manufacturing partners 
enforcement of agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of laws may be inconsistent 
the chinese judiciary is relatively inexperienced in interpreting agreements and enforcing the laws  leading to a higher than usual degree of uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation 
even where adequate law exists in china  it may be impossible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of such law  or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction 
the government of china may change or even reverse its policies of promoting private industry and foreign investment  in which case our assets and operations may be at risk 
we currently have relationships with manufacturers in china for the production of our products and have transitioned our core operations to china 
china is a socialist state  which since has been  and is expected to continue to be  controlled by the communist party of china 
our existing and planned operations in china are subject to the general risks of doing business internationally and the specific risks related to the business  economic and political conditions in china  which include the possibility that the central government of china will change or even reverse its policies of promoting private industry and foreign investment in china 
many of the current reforms which support private business in china are unprecedented or experimental 
other political  economic and social factors  such as political changes  changes in the rates of economic growth  unemployment or inflation  or in the disparities of per capita wealth among citizens of china and between regions within china  could also lead to further readjustment of the government s reform measures 
it is not possible to predict whether the chinese government will continue to be as supportive of private business in china  nor is it possible to predict how future reforms will affect our business 
the government of china continues to exercise substantial control over the chinese economy which could have a negative impact on our business 
the government of china has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every section of the chinese economy through regulation and state ownership 
china s continued commitment to reform and the development of a vital private sector in that country have  to some extent  limited the practical effects of the control currently exercised by the government over individual enterprises 
however  the economy continues to be subject to significant government controls  which  if directed towards our business activities  could have a significant adverse impact on us 
for example  if the government were to limit the number of foreign personnel who could work in the country  or were to substantially increase taxes on foreign businesses or were to impose any number of other possible types of limitations on our operations  the impact would be significant 
changes in china s political and economic policies could harm our business 
the economy of china has historically been a planned economy subject to governmental plans and quotas and has  in certain aspects  been transitioning to a more market oriented economy 
although we believe that the economic reform and the macroeconomic measures adopted by the chinese government have had a positive effect on the economic development of china  we cannot predict the future direction of these economic reforms or the effects these measures may have on our business  financial position or results of operations 
in addition  the chinese economy differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the organization for economic cooperation and development  or oecd 
these differences include o economic structure  o level of government involvement in the economy  o level of development o level of capital reinvestment  o control of foreign exchange  o methods of allocating resources  and o balance of payments position 
as a result of these differences  our operations  including our current manufacturing operations in china  may not develop in the same way or at the same rate as might be expected if the chinese economy were similar to the oecd member countries 
china currency exchange issues we incur expenses and liabilities in both chinese rmb and us dollars 
as a result  we are subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations with respect to any of these currencies 
for example  the value of the chinese rmb depends to a large extent on the prc s domestic and international economic and political developments  as well as supply and demand in the local market 
since  the official exchange rate for the conversion of chinese rmb to us dollars has generally been stable and the chinese rmb has appreciated slightly against the us dollar 
however  given recent economic instability and currency fluctuations  we can offer no assurance that the chinese rmb will continue to remain stable against the us dollar or any other foreign currency 
although chinese governmental policies were introduced in to allow the convertibility of chinese rmb into foreign currency for current account items  conversion of chinese rmb into foreign exchange for capital items  such as foreign direct investment  loans or security  requires the approval of the state administration of foreign exchange  or safe  which is under the authority of the people s bank of china 
these approvals  however  do not guarantee the availability of foreign currency 
we cannot be sure that chinese regulatory authorities will not impose greater restrictions on the convertibility of the chinese rmb in the future 
because a significant amount of our operations are in china  any future restrictions on currency exchanges could have an adverse effect on our ability to do business in china 
business practices in china may entail greater risk and dependence upon the personal relationships of senior management than is common in north america and therefore some of our agreements with other parties in china could be difficult or impossible to enforce 
the business culture of china is  in some respects  different from the business culture in western countries and may present some difficulty for western investors reviewing contractual relationships among companies in china and evaluating the merits of an investment 
personal relationships among business principals of companies and business entities in china are very significant in the business culture 
in some cases  because so much reliance is based upon personal relationships  written contracts among businesses in china may be less detailed and specific than is commonly accepted for similar written agreements in western countries 
in some cases  material terms of an understanding are not contained in the written agreement but exist as oral agreements only 
in other cases  the terms of transactions which may involve material amounts of money are not documented at all 
in addition  in contrast to western business practices where a written agreement specifically defines the terms  rights and obligations of the parties in a legally binding and enforceable manner  the parties to a written agreement in china may view that agreement more as a starting point for an ongoing business relationship which will evolve and require ongoing modification 
as a result  written agreements in china may appear to the western reader to look more like outline agreements that precede a formal written agreement 
while these documents may appear incomplete or unenforceable to a western reader  the parties to the agreement in the prc may feel that they have a more complete understanding than is apparent to someone who is only reading the written agreement without having attended the negotiations 
as a result  contractual arrangements in china may be more difficult to review and understand 
also  despite legal developments in china over the past years  adequate laws  comparable with western standards  do not exist in all areas and it is unclear how many of our business arrangements would be interpreted or enforced by a court in china 
if the relationship between china and the united states deteriorates  the government of china could adversely change its policies with respect to us investment in companies in china 
our business may be adversely affected by the diplomatic and political relationships between the united states and china 
these influences may adversely affect our ability to operate in china 
if the relationship between the united states and china were to materially deteriorate  it could negatively affect our ability to control our operations and relationships in china  enforce any agreements we have with chinese manufacturers or otherwise deal with any assets or investments we may have in china 
our operations could be materially interrupted  and we may suffer a large amount of loss  in the case of fire  casualty or theft at one of our manufacturing or other facilities 
our products are manufactured by chinese manufacturers through contractual relationships 
in addition  we are pursuing a strategy of expanding our operations in china 
firefighting and disaster relief or assistance in china is substandard by western standards 
consistent with common practice in china for companies the size of us and our business partners in china  neither we nor they  to our knowledge  maintain fire  casualty  theft insurance or business interruption insurance 
in the event of a loss of revenue or material damage to  or loss of  the manufacturing plants where our products are currently produced  or  in the future  where are other operations  including manufacturing  will occur  due to fire  casualty  theft  severe weather  flood or other cause  we would be forced to replace any assets lost in such disaster without the benefit of insurance and our financial position could be materially compromised or we might have to cease doing business 
also  consistent with customary business practices among enterprises in china  we do not carry business interruption insurance 
the system of taxation in china is uncertain and subject to unpredictable change that could affect our profitability 
many tax rules are not published in china and those that are published can be ambiguous and contradictory leaving a considerable amount of discretion to local tax authorities 
china currently offers tax and other preferential incentives to encourage foreign investment 
however  the country s tax regime is undergoing review and there is no assurance that such tax and other incentives will continue to be made available 
currently  china levies a withholding tax on profit allocations ie  dividends received from chinese foreign joint ventures 
if we enter into a joint venture with a chinese company as part of our strategy to reduce costs  such a joint venture may be considered a chinese foreign joint venture if the majority of its equity interests are owned by a foreign shareholder 
a temporary exemption from this withholding tax has been granted to foreign investors 
however  there is no indication when this exemption will end 
it is uncertain whether we will be able to recover value added taxes imposed by the chinese taxing authorities 
china s turnover tax system consists of value added tax  consumption tax and business tax 
export sales are exempted under vat rules and an exporter who incurs input vat on purchase or manufacture of goods should be able to claim a refund from chinese tax authorities 
however  due to a reduction in the vat export refund rate of some goods  exporters might bear part of the vat they incurred in conjunction with the exported goods 
in  changes to the chinese value added tax system were announced affecting the recoverability of input vat beginning january  our vat expense will depend on the reaction of both our suppliers and customers 
continued efforts by the chinese government to increase tax revenues could result in revisions to tax laws or their interpretation  which could increase our vat and various tax liabilities 
any recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  or another widespread public health problem  could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
a renewed outbreak of sars or another widespread public health problem in china  where we have moved our manufacturing operations and may move additional operations  could have a negative effect on our operations 
our operations may be impacted by a number of health related factors  including the following o quarantines or closures of some of our manufacturing or other facilities which would severely disrupt our operations  or o the sickness or death of key officers or employees of our manufacturing or other facilities 
any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems in china could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our production and shipping capabilities could be adversely affected by ongoing tensions between the chinese and taiwanese governments 
key components of our products are manufactured in china and assembled in taiwan into end products or systems 
in the event that taiwan does not adopt a plan for unifying with china  the chinese government has threatened military action against taiwan 
as of yet  taiwan has not indicated that it intends to propose and adopt a reunification plan 
if an invasion by china were to occur  the ability of our manufacturing and assembly partners could be adversely affected  potentially limiting our production capabilities 
an invasion could also lead to sanctions or military action by the united states and or european countries  which could further adversely affect our business 
risks associated with our industry if competing technologies that outperform our batteries were developed and successfully introduced  then our products might not be able to compete effectively in our targeted market segments 
rapid and ongoing changes in technology and product standards could quickly render our products less competitive  or even obsolete 
other companies are seeking to enhance traditional battery technologies  such as lead acid and nickel cadmium or have recently introduced or are developing batteries based on nickel metal hydride  liquid lithium ion and other emerging and potential technologies 
these competitors are engaged in significant development work on these various battery systems  and we believe that much of this effort is focused on achieving higher energy densities for low power applications such as portable electronics 
one or more new  higher energy rechargeable battery technologies could be introduced which could be directly competitive with  or superior to  our technology 
the capabilities of many of these competing technologies have improved over the past several years 
competing technologies that outperform our batteries could be developed and successfully introduced  and as a result  there is a risk that our products may not be able to compete effectively in our targeted market segments 
we have invested in research and development of next generation technology in energy solutions 
if we are not successful in developing and commercially exploiting new energy solutions based on new materials  or we experience delays in the development and exploitation of new energy solutions  compared to our competitors  our future growth and revenues will be adversely affected 
our principal competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and they may therefore develop batteries similar or superior to ours or otherwise compete more successfully than we do 
competition in the rechargeable battery industry is intense 
the industry consists of major domestic and international companies  most of which have financial  technical  marketing  sales  manufacturing  distribution and other resources substantially greater than ours 
there is a risk that other companies may develop batteries similar or superior to ours 
in addition  many of these companies have name recognition  established positions in the market  and long standing relationships with oems and other customers 
we believe that our primary competitors are existing suppliers of liquid lithium ion  competing polymer and  in some cases  nickel metal hydride batteries 
these suppliers include sanyo  matsushita industrial co  ltd 
panasonic  sony  toshiba  saft and electrovaya 
most of these companies are very large and have substantial resources and market presence 
we expect that we will compete against manufacturers of other types of batteries in our targeted application segments  which include laptops  cellular telephones  and personal digital assistant products  on the basis of performance  size and shape  cost  and ease of recycling 
there is also a risk that we may not be able to compete successfully against manufacturers of other types of batteries in any of our targeted applications 
laws regulating the manufacture or transportation of batteries may be enacted which could result in a delay in the production of our batteries or the imposition of additional costs that could harm our ability to be profitable 
at the present time  international  federal  state  or local law does not directly regulate the storage  use  and disposal of the component parts of our batteries 
however  laws and regulations may be enacted in the future  which could impose environmental  health and safety controls on the storage  use  and disposal of certain chemicals and metals used in the manufacture of lithium polymer batteries 
satisfying any future laws or regulations could require significant time and resources from our technical staff and possible redesign which may result in substantial expenditures and delays in the production of our product  all of which could harm our business and reduce our future profitability 
the transportation of lithium and lithium ion batteries is regulated both internationally and domestically 
under recently revised united nations recommendations and as adopted by the international air transport association iata  our n chargetm power system model vnc and n chargetm power system ii are exempt from a class designation for transportation  while our n chargetm power system model vnc  our k charge tm power system  and u charge tm power system currently fall within the level such that they are not exempt and require a class designation for transportation 
the revised united nations recommendations are not us law until such time as they are incorporated into the dot hazardous material regulations 
however  dot has proposed new regulations harmonizing with the un guidelines 
at present it is not known if or when the proposed regulations would be adopted by the united states 
while we fall under the equivalency levels for the united states and comply with all safety packaging requirements worldwide  future dot or iata regulations or enforcement policies could impose costly transportation requirements 
in addition  compliance with any new dot and iata approval process could require significant time and resources from our technical staff and  if redesign were necessary  could delay the introduction of new products 
general risks associated with stock ownership corporate insiders or their affiliates will be able to exercise significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval that might not be in the best interests of our stockholders as a whole 
as of june   our officers  directors and their affiliates as a group beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
carl berg  one of our directors  beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions  which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
the interest of our officers and directors  when acting in their capacity as stockholders  may lead them to o vote for the election of directors who agree with the incumbent officers or directors preferred corporate policy  or o oppose or support significant corporate transactions when these transactions further their interests as incumbent officers or directors  even if these interests diverge from their interests as stockholders per se and thus from the interests of other stockholders 
some provisions of our charter documents may make takeover attempts difficult  which could depress the price of our stock and limit the price that potential acquirers may be willing to pay for our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority  without any action by the outside stockholders  to issue additional shares of our preferred stock  which shares may be given superior voting  liquidation  distribution and other rights as compared to those of our common stock 
the rights of the holders of our capital stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price  may decrease the market price  and may infringe upon the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 
at any given time we might not meet the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market 
given the volatility of our stock and trends in the stock market in general  at any given time we might not meet the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market 
among other requirements  nasdaq requires the minimum bid price of a company s registered shares to be 
on june   the closing price of our common stock was 
if we are not able to maintain the requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  it could have a materially adverse effect on the price and liquidity of our common stock 
our stock price is volatile  which could result in a loss of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
factors that may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock include the following o fluctuation in our operating results  o announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  o failure to achieve operating results projected by securities analysts  o governmental regulation  o developments in our patent or other proprietary rights or our competitors developments  o our relationships with current or future collaborative partners  and o other factors and events beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
as a result of this potential stock price volatility  investors may be unable to sell their shares of our common stock at or above the cost of their purchase prices 
in addition  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the subject of securities class action litigation  this could result in substantial costs  a diversion of our management s attention and resources and harm to our business and financial condition 
future sales of currently outstanding shares could adversely affect our stock price 
the market price of our common stock could drop as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or in response to the perception that these sales could occur 
in addition these sales might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
we had outstanding  shares of common stock as of march  in addition  at march   we had  shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under warrants and stock option plans 
in connection with the potential conversion of the series c convertible preferred stock issued on june   we expect that we may need to issue up to an additional  shares of our common stock based on a conversion price of and up to  shares upon exercise of the related warrant issued on june  we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock  and therefore stockholders will be able to recover their investment in our common stock  if at all  only by selling the shares of our stock that they hold 
some investors favor companies that pay dividends on common stock 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
because we may not pay dividends  a return on an investment in our stock likely depends on the ability to sell our stock at a profit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we considered the provisions of financial reporting release no 
 disclosures of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosures of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative commodity instruments 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at march  however  we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
thereafter total dollars in thousands liabilities fixed rate debt   variable rate debt   based on borrowing rates currently available to us for loans with similar terms  the carrying value of our debt obligations approximates fair value
