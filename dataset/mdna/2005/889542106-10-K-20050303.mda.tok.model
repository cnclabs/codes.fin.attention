item business 
tollgrade communications  inc is a leading provider of hardware and software network assurance testing solutions for the telecommunications and cable broadband industries 
we design  engineer  market and support test systems  test access  performance management and status monitoring products which enable telephone and cable operators to efficiently manage their networks in an age of increased competition  continually evolving technology and ongoing pressure to control or reduce costs 
we provide equipment that enables telephone companies to evaluate problems so they can ultimately repair their wire telephone lines when they are not functioning properly 
when the telephone lines are out of service  our products help to diagnose the problem 
in addition  our products can assess whether the lines are suitable for digital subscriber line dsl service for the delivery of internet and other broadband services 
for broadband cable networks  the outside plant segment of the network is highly dependent upon standby power for network reliability  if commercial power fails  such standby power supplies must sustain the network or services such as video  data and voice become inoperable 
we provide products to cable companies that monitor and test the status of physical network elements power supplies  fiber nodes as well as to measure the performance of services voice  video and data within the outside plant 
we were incorporated in pennsylvania in  began operations in and completed our initial public offering in our principal offices are located at nixon road  cheswick  pennsylvania and our telephone number is we make available free of charge on our internet website www

products telecommunication test systems our proprietary telecommunications test and measurement products enable telephone companies to use their existing line test systems to remotely diagnose problems in plain old telephone service pots lines containing both copper and fiber optics as well as qualify and troubleshoot broadband dsl lines 
pots lines provide traditional voice service as well as connections for popular communication devices such as computer modems and fax machines 
pots excludes non switched and private lines  such as data communications service lines  commonly referred to as special services 
pots lines still comprise the vast majority of lines in service today throughout the world 
an important aspect of maintaining a pots network is the ability to remotely test  diagnose and locate any problems within the network 
pots line test systems are generally located at telephone companies central offices  and help local exchange carriers conduct a full range of fault diagnostics in the local loop  the portion of the telephone network that connects end users to the central office 
in addition  line test systems provide the capability to remotely qualify  deploy and maintain next generation services including dsl and integrated services digital network isdn services which are carried over pots lines 
these test systems reduce the time 
table of contents needed to identify and resolve problems  eliminating or reducing the costs of dispatching a technician to the problem site 
most pots line test systems  however  were designed only for use over copper wire line  as a result  traditional test systems cannot access local loops in which fiber optic technology has been introduced 
our proprietary metallic channel unit mcu products solve this problem by mimicking a digital bypass pair  which is essentially a telephone circuit that connects central test and measurement devices to the copper circuits close to the customer  known as the last mile 
we believe our digitest system represents the future of telecommunication network testing  combining our line test system with a next generation test platform to provide complete hardware testing for pots and local loop prequalification and in service testing for dsl service 
digitest and loopcare our digitest system electrically measures the characteristics of a copper telephone circuit and reports those measurements to our loopcare operation support system oss 
the loopcare oss  in turn  analyzes that measurement data and creates an easy to understand fault description 
at the same time  the loopcare system can generate a dispatch to a work center so that a repairman can fix the problem 
loopcare and digitest also can determine whether the customer line is suitable for dsl service 
digitest can also serve as a replacement for aging loop test system lts equipment ubiquitously deployed in current pots networks 
in addition  upgrades to digitest hardware can provide troubleshooting for dsl service problems 
loopcare has remained the major oss utilized by the regional bell operating companies rbocs for over twenty five years to test the integrity and quality of their pots network infrastructure 
the loopcare oss  which we offer both as part of the digitest system and as a stand alone software product that can interface with other test heads on the market  currently manages testing operations for more than of the copper pairs in the united states  and is the qualification  installation and maintenance tool used to troubleshoot for more than million pots  isdn and dsl subscribers worldwide 
we acquired loopcare from lucent in in  we announced several enhancements and additions to the digitest system  including the availability of direct ethernet connectivity to digital measurement node dmn test heads and the introduction of our next generation broadband test platform  digitest edge 
through ethernet connections  the loopcare oss can communicate directly with remotely deployed digitest hardware  allowing it to manage up to four dmns and eight simultaneous test sessions through a single internet protocol ip address 
digitest edge provides a global platform for broadband test applications  by combining a narrowband and wideband metallic testing platform for dsl  asynchronous transfer mode atm  ip and hypertext transfer protocol http performance tests 
in addition  in we announced a new loopcare feature that  working in conjunction with the digitest hardware  and using innovative insertion loss measurements  provides a customer with highly accurate predictions of potential dsl connect speeds 
these test capabilities  when managed by our loopcare oss  enables service providers to accurately isolate a dsl problem between the customer s premises  the local exchange carrier s local loop and digital subscriber line access multiplexer dslam serving network  and the internet service provider s data network 
we market and sell our digitest products directly to customers as well as through certain continuing original equipment manufacturer oem arrangements with lucent and nortel networks 
the lucent agreement  which expired under its original terms in september but has been extended through march  and is currently under renegotiation  allows lucent to resell loopcare software on an oem basis 
we also have an oem agreement in place with electrodata  inc to supply a communications card for our digitest edge product 
this agreement also contains automatic renewal terms  unless earlier terminated 
we are also a party to a number of third party software license agreements that allow us to incorporate third party software products and features into the loopcare software 
we have licensing arrangements with nortel  acterna  llc and aware  inc for certain technology related to our digitest products and pay royalties and license fees for the use of such technology on a fixed per unit basis 
the license agreement with acterna  which is currently under negotiation regarding the termination rights of the parties  expires by its terms in  unless earlier terminated  and the agreements with aware and nortel contain automatic renewal terms  unless earlier terminated 
sales of the digitest product line including sales with loopcare software accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition to the loopcare oss software sold as part of the digitest system  we also sell new loopcare features to existing customers and the base loopcare oss as a stand alone product to competitive local exchange carriers clecs for use with test heads other than our digitest hardware 
loopcare feature products include the common object request broker architecture corba based application programming interface  benchmark data base  dsl testing  the advanced testhead feature package  batch testing  fax unalert  loop length reporting  enabling flow through by re classification of ver codes  loopcare tcp ip communications network  and testing voice services in a broadband passive optical network bpon 
table of contents sales of stand alone loopcare software and enhancements accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
mcu our core mcu products plug into digital loop carrier dlc systems  the large network transmission systems used by telephone companies to link the copper and fiber optic portions of the local loop 
mcu products allow our customers to extend their line testing capabilities to all of their pots lines served by a dlc system regardless of whether the system is fed by a copper or fiber optic link 
dlc systems  which are located at telephone companies central offices and at remote sites within local user areas  effectively multiplex the services of a single fiber optic line into multiple copper lines 
in many instances  several dlc systems are located at a single remote site to create multiple local loops that serve several thousand different end user homes and businesses 
generally  for every dlc remote site  customers will deploy at least two mcu line testing products 
we market and sell our mcu products directly to customers as well as through certain oem agreements  as described below 
to ensure the compatibility of our mcu products with the major dlc systems produced by various telecommunication equipment manufacturers  we have entered into license agreements and  in most cases  pay royalties for the use of the proprietary design integrated circuits pdics unique to each dlc system 
we maintain royalty based pdic license agreements with lucent technologies  inc  fujitsu network transmission systems  inc  zhone technologies  inc  tellabs  inc formerly  advanced fibre access communications and adtran  inc  the terms of all but one of which automatically renew unless earlier terminated for periods of between one and five years  the other agreement has a perpetual term 
we paid   and  in  and  respectively  in royalties under these license agreements  which are calculated either as a percentage of the list price of mcu products sold or as a fixed amount per mcu unit that incorporates the licensed technology 
we also maintain pdic license agreements that do not contain royalty provisions with tellabs  inc  alcatel usa sourcing  lp formerly dsc technologies corporation  utstarcom  inc  motorola  inc 
formerly  next level communications and sagem sa  the expiration dates of these agreements range from november to may  with renewal provisions for periods of one or more years  unless earlier terminated 
we also employ our mcu technology in connection with home and business alarm systems 
as with pots line testing  home alarm systems must be monitored from the alarm company s headquarters along a hybrid copper and fiber optic line 
our alarm related mcu products  which are installed at both central office and remote locations  facilitate the transport of analog alarm signals from subscribers homes to alarm company monitoring stations across the hybrid telephone network 
sales of mcu products and related hardware accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively

the services business was considerably expanded upon the acquisition of software maintenance relationships related to the loopcare and cheetahnet software product lines 
including software maintenance  services revenue accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
reporting segment we have determined that our business has one reporting segment  the test assurance industry 
all product sales are considered components of the business of testing infrastructure and networks for the telecommunications and cable television industries 
although we do internally develop sales results associated with the various product categories  this information is not considered to be sufficient for segment reporting purposes and our chief operating decision maker does not base critical decisions or allocate assets based solely on this information 
our products and services have similar economic characteristics and the same or similar production processes  and are sold through comparable distribution channels and means to similar types and classes of customers already in  or entering into  the telecommunications and cable businesses 
sales and competition we market our products and services primarily through our direct sales organization with offices in cheswick  pennsylvania  and sarasota  florida 
additionally  we have a growing channel of oems  value added resellers and distributors  both domestic and international 
domestic sales the primary customers for our products and services are the four regional bell operating companies rbocs  verizon communications  inc  bellsouth corporation  sbc communications inc and qwest communications international  inc  as well as major independent telephone companies and most of the major cable operators 
sales in to sbc  verizon and bellsouth accounted for approximately   and  respectively  or collectively  of our total revenue for the year 
sales generated from these three rboc customers has remained consistent at in and in  however  this is a significant decrease from the of revenues that these three rbocs comprised 
sales in to qwest did not exceed of our total revenue  nor do we expect it to for the near future 
we have continued to focus on reducing our dependency on rboc customers and  in  we purchased cheetah to help accomplish this goal 
sales of the cheetah product line accounted for approximately of revenue  none of which was comprised of any individual customer exceeding 
because of our continued dependency on the four rbocs  however  the potential loss of one or more of them as customers  or the reduction of orders for our products by one or more of them  could materially and adversely affect our results 
international sales international sales represented approximately of the company s total revenue for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december  although our international sales have increased year over year  our success in marketing and selling our telecommunications products in international markets has been limited  due in part to incompatibility of certain of our telecommunications products with networks employed abroad 
see the discussion in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this form k for a further examination of our strategies relating to international sales and our signing of an agreement during the fourth quarter of with lucent technologies international  inc for deployment of our products internationally 
competitive conditions the market for telecommunications and cable television testing equipment is highly competitive 
primary competitive factors in the company s market include price  product features  performance  reliability  service and support  breadth of product line  technical documentation and prompt delivery 
we believe that we compete favorably with regard to all of these factors 
the traditional competitors for our pots telecommunications products include fluke formerly harris corporation  porta systems corp  teradyne  inc  nortel networks  ltd 
and emerson network power 
each of these companies provides centralized test and management solutions for pots networks 
historically  we have successfully positioned ourselves against these offerings by leveraging patented technologies  entering into partnerships with telecommunications equipment providers and creating incumbent positions within our customers networks 
as we extend our product offerings to address dsl  fttp  ip  and atm test applications for emerging next generation networks  this list of traditional competitors is expanding to include spirent communications  acterna corporation  telcordia  micromuse and consultronics ltd 
we believe that our ability to test these next generation networks by upgrading our existing  
table of contents highly automated incumbent infrastructure provides an advantage over these new competitors in terms of upfront deployment costs and long term operational efficiency 
as our customers networks continue to evolve  we also face competition as testing functions that our products might provide can be built into network elements of other providers  such as infineon  legerity  broadcom  texas instruments and aware 
with respect to our cable products  traditional status performance monitoring competitors include am communications  cableware  scientific atlanta and electroline 
historically  we have maintained an advantage over these competitors through the mass deployment of proprietary technology within the major cable operators 
in recent years the cable industry has adopted open  non proprietary standards for status performance monitoring systems  such as hybrid management sub layer hms and docsis  which has created pricing pressures as all providers of monitoring transponders have reduced price points to meet customer demands 
as a result  we have modified our competitive strategies in an attempt to better leverage exclusive partnerships with premier cable equipment providers and to enhance our incumbent systems for the support of internet protocol based service assurance testing 
as with the telecommunications products  the extension of our cable products to address internet protocol test applications expands our list of traditional competitors to now include micromuse  aprisma  auspice  c cornet 
net  agilent  and acterna corporation 
we feel that our ability to seamlessly integrate technology partners  such as brix networks and telchemy  with our incumbent solutions provides an advantage over these competitors when positioning ourselves for internet protocol testing opportunities within the major cable operators 
manufacturing our manufacturing operations consist primarily of quality control  functional testing  final assembly  burn in and shipping 
we are iso registered with the british standards institution  inc iso is a harmonized set of standards that define quality assurance management 
written by the international organization for standardization iso  iso is recognized throughout the united states  canada  the european union and japan 
to be registered  the company develops and maintains internal documentation and processes to support the production of quality products to ensure customer satisfaction 
for our telephony products  we utilize two key independent subcontractors to perform a majority of the circuit board assembly and in circuit testing work 
we also employ other subassembly contractors for our telephony products on a more limited basis 
for our cheetah hardware  we primarily use a single turnkey manufacturer  dictaphone corporation s electronic manufacturing services division  to procure the components and assemble and test the products 
the loss of any of these subcontractors could cause delays in our ability to meet our customers orders and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  shortages of raw materials delivered to  or production capacity constraints at  the company s subcontractors could negatively affect our ability to meet our production obligations and result in increased prices for affected parts 
any such reduction may result in delays in shipments of the company s products or increases in the price of components  either of which could have a material adverse impact on us 
generally  our products use industry standard components  however  application specific integrated circuits asics are also a key component of our products and are custom made to the company s specifications 
although we have generally been able to obtain asics on a timely basis  a delay in the delivery of these components could have a material adverse impact on the company 
product and technology development our product development personnel  many of whom are bell labs trained  are organized into teams dedicated to one or more specific product lines or technologies 
we continuously monitor developing technologies in order to introduce new or improved products as defined standards and markets emerge 
during  we committed much of our research and development resources to the development of digitest edge  which was introduced during the year 
in addition  we continue to investigate the development of new applications for our mcu and cheetah technologies  as well as develop enhancements and new features to our loopcare software product line  digitest hardware and other technologies to service the telecommunications and cable industries 
for the years ended december   and  research and development expenses were approximately   and  respectively 
proprietary rights intellectual property rights that apply to our various products include patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks and maskwork rights 
we maintain an active program to protect our investment in technology by enforcing our intellectual property rights 
the extent of the legal protection given to different types of intellectual property rights varies under different countries legal systems

we have obtained three united states patents on the mcu products with expiration dates ranging from to  two united states and one canadian patent on cable technology with expiration dates of  and  respectively and one canadian patent  one taiwanese patent and seven united states patents on other telecommunications technology  with expiration in dates ranging from to in addition  we have five united states and five canadian patent applications pending and one european patent and ten international patent cooperation treaty patent applications which have been filed 
we will seek additional patents from time to time related to our research and development 
table of contents activities 
we protect our trademarks  patents  inventions  trade secrets  and other proprietary rights by contract  trademark  copyright and patent registration  and internal security 
although we believe that patents are an important element of our success  we do not believe that our business  as a whole  is materially dependent on any one patent 
backlog our backlog consists of firm customer purchase orders and signed software maintenance agreements 
as of december   we had a backlog of approximately  all of which is expected to be filled in  as compared to approximately  of backlog at december  we currently have loopcare software maintenance agreements with three of the four rbocs 
two were entered into in and have terms of one year expiring december  the third contract is for a three year term expiring on december  we are also currently in negotiations with the remaining rboc regarding renewal of its software maintenance agreement 
our backlog at december  includes approximately  related to software maintenance contracts 
we have adopted a policy to include a maximum of twelve months revenue from multi year agreements in reported backlog 
software maintenance revenue is deemed to be earned and recognized as income on a straight line basis over the terms of the underlying agreements 
periodic fluctuations in customer orders and backlog result from a variety of factors  including but not limited to the timing of significant orders and shipments 
although these fluctuations could impact short term results  they are not necessarily indicative of long term trends in sales of our products 
government regulation the telecommunications industry is subject to regulation in the united states and other countries 
federal and state regulatory agencies  including the federal communications commission fcc and various state public utility and service commissions  regulate the activities of most of our domestic customers 
although such regulation does not typically affect the company directly  the effects of such regulations on our customers may  in turn  adversely impact our business and operating results 
governmental authorities have also promulgated regulations which  among other things  set installation and equipment standards for private telecommunications systems and require that all newly installed hardware be registered and meet certain government standards 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  all of whom were located in the united states 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  and we believe that our relations with our employees are good

risks factors that might affect future operating results and financial condition we wish to caution each reader of this form k to consider the following factors and certain other factors discussed herein and in other past reports  including but not limited to prior year form k and form q reports and annual reports filed with the sec 
our business and results of operations could be seriously impaired by any of the following risks 
the factors discussed herein may not be exhaustive 
therefore  the factors contained herein should be read together with other reports and documents that we file with the sec from time to time  which may supplement  modify  supercede or update the factors listed in this document 
we depend upon a few major customers for a majority of our revenues  and the loss of any of these customers  or the substantial reduction in the products that they purchase from us  would significantly reduce our revenues and net income 
we depend upon a few major customers for a majority of our revenues 
we expect to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers in the future 
the loss of any of these customers  or the cancellation  delay or reduction in purchases of our products at historical levels  would significantly reduce our revenues and net income 
furthermore  decreases in the capital budgets of these customers could lead to their reduced demand for our products  which could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operation 
the capital budgets of our rboc customers  as well as many of our other customers  are dictated by a number of factors  most of which are beyond our control  including the conditions of the telecommunications market and the economy in general  subscriber line loss and related reduced demand for telecommunications services  changes or shifts in the technology utilized in the networks  labor disputes between our customers and their collective bargaining units  the failure to meet established purchase forecasts and growth projections  competition among the rbocs  competitive exchange carriers and wireless telecommunications and cable providers  and reorganizations  including management changes  at one or more of our customers or potential customers 
if the financial strength of one or more of our major customers should deteriorate  or if they have difficulty acquiring investment capital due to any of these or other factors  a substantial decrease in our revenues would likely result 
our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter  causing our stock price to fluctuate 
our operating results have in the past been subject to quarter to quarter fluctuations  and we expect that these fluctuations will continue  and may increase in magnitude  in future periods 
demand for our products is driven by many factors  including the availability of funding in customers capital budgets 
there is a trend for some of our customers to place large orders near the end of a quarter or fiscal year  in part to spend remaining available capital budget funds 
seasonal fluctuations in customer demand for our products driven by budgetary and other reasons can create corresponding fluctuations in period to period revenues  and we therefore cannot assure you that our results in one period are necessary indicative of our revenues in any future period 
in addition  the number and timing of large individual sales has been difficult for us to predict  and large individual sales have  in some cases  occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated  or have not occurred at all 
the loss or deferral of one or more significant sales in a quarter could harm our operating results 
it is possible that in some quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of

in such events  or in the event adverse conditions prevail  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 
the sales cycle for our software products is long  and the delay or failure to complete one or more large license transactions in a quarter could cause our operating results to fall below our expectations 
the sales cycle is highly customer specific and can vary from a few weeks to many months 
the software requirements of customers is highly dependent on many factors  including but not limited to their projections of business growth  capital budgets and anticipated cost savings from implementation of our software 
our delay or failure to complete one or more large license transactions in a quarter could harm our operating results 
our software involves significant capital commitments by customers 
potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available enterprise software and require us to expend substantial time  effort and money educating them about the value of our solutions 
licensing of our software products often requires an extensive sales effort throughout a customer s organization because decisions to license such software generally involve the evaluation of the software by a significant number of customer personnel in various functional and geographic areas  each often having specific and conflicting requirements 
a variety of factors  including actions by competitors and other factors over which we have little or no control  may cause potential customers to favor a particular supplier or to delay or forego a purchase 
many of the company s products must comply with significant governmental and industry based regulations  certifications  standards and protocols  some of which evolve as new technologies are deployed 
compliance with such regulations  certifications  standards and protocols may prove costly and time consuming for the company  and the company cannot provide assurance that its products will continue to meet these standards in the future 
in addition  regulatory compliance may present barriers to entry in particular markets or reduce the profitability of the company s product offerings 
such regulations  certifications  standards and protocols may also adversely affect the industries in which we compete  limit the number of potential customers for the company s products and services or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to comply  or delays in compliance  with such regulations  standards and protocols or delays in receipt of such certifications could delay the introduction of new products or cause the company s existing products to become obsolete 
we depend on sales of our mcu products for a significant portion of our revenues  but this product is maturing and may result in declining sales 
a large portion of our sales have historically been attributable to our mcu products 
we expect that our mcu products may continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
however  these sales are declining 
mcu sales largely depend upon the rate of deployment of new  and the retrofitting of existing  digital loop carrier dlc systems in the united states 
installation and replacement of dlc systems are  in turn  driven by a number of factors  including the availability of capital resources and the demand for new or better plain old telephone service pots 
the current plans of our customers  if executed  to implement next generation network improvements such as fiber to the premise fttp  which does not require the use of our mcu products as the present hybrid pots network  could materially impact our mcu sales 
if our major customers fail to continue to build out their dsl networks and other projects requiring dlc deployments  or if we otherwise satisfy the domestic telecommunications market s demand for mcus  our future results would be materially and adversely affected 
although we are unable to predict future prices for our mcu products  we expect that prices for these products will continue to be subject to significant downward pressure in certain markets for the reasons described above 
accordingly  our ability to maintain or increase revenues will be dependent on our ability to expand our customer base  increase unit sales volumes of these products and to successfully  develop  introduce and sell new products such as our cable and software products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to expand our customer base  increase unit sales volumes of existing products or develop  introduce and or sell new products 
we recently emphasized our network assurance and testing software solutions and cable status monitoring products 
we acquired the loopcare software and cheetah product lines in and  respectively 
a substantial portion of our research and development expenses currently relates to these products 
we have adjusted our business model to focus heavily on our cable performance and status monitoring products 
we are actively engaged in research to improve and expand our cable products  including research and development of voip solutions 
our cable products have lower margins than our mcu  loopcare and digitest system products 
if sales of our cable testing products do not increase or are not accepted in the marketplace  or if our research and development activities do not produce marketable products that are both competitive and accepted by our customers  our overall revenues and profitability will be adversely affected 
in addition  although software products generally generate higher margin returns for us than our hardware products  the initial development costs of software applications  coupled with the inherent problems with pricing software sold to customers  can make it difficult to assess the potential profitability of new software products 
unless we acquire proprietary software  we must internally develop any new software products 
software development is a relatively expensive and lengthy process 
in addition  because it is 
table of contents customary in our industry to sell perpetual enterprise licenses that cover an entire customer s operations  it can be difficult to assess at the time of sale the exact price that we should charge for a particular license 
the sale of our products is dependent upon our ability to satisfy the proprietary requirements of our customers and respond to rapid technological change  including evolving industry wide standards 
we depend upon a relatively narrow range of products for the majority of our revenue 
our success in marketing our products is dependent upon their continued acceptance by our customers 
in some cases  our customers require that our products meet their own proprietary requirements 
if we are unable to satisfy such requirements  or forecast and adapt to changes in such requirements  our business could be materially harmed 
rapid technological change  including evolving industry standards  could also render our products obsolete 
the adoption of industry wide standards  such as the hms and docsis cable standards  may result in the elimination of or reductions in the demand for many of our proprietary products  such as our cheetah head end hardware products and other cheetah products 
furthermore  standards for new services and technologies continue to evolve  requiring us to continually modify our products or to develop new versions to meet these new standards 
certain of these certifications are limited in scope  which may require that the product be recertified if any modifications to hardware or firmware are made 
if we are unable to forecast the demand for  and to develop new products or to adapt our existing products to meet  these evolving standards and other technological innovations  or if our products and services do not gain the acceptance of our customers  there could be a negative effect on our revenues for sales of such products 
our customers are subject to governmental regulations that could significantly reduce the demand for our products or increase our costs of doing business 
our customers have historically been subject to a number of governmental regulations  many of which have been repealed or amended as a result of the passage of the telecommunications act of deregulatory efforts have affected and likely will continue to affect our customers in several ways  including the introduction of competitive forces into the local telephone markets and the imposition or removal of controls on the pricing of services 
these and other regulatory changes may limit the scope of our customers deployments of future services and budgets for capital expenditures  which could significantly reduce the demand for our products 
moreover  as the federal communications commission fcc adopts new and amends existing regulations  and as the courts analyze the fcc s authority to do so  our customers cannot accurately predict the rules by which they will be able to compete in their respective markets 
changes in the telecommunications regulatory environment could  among other results  increase our costs of doing business  require our customers to share assets with competitors or prevent the company or our customers from engaging in business activities they may wish to conduct  which could adversely affect our future results 
our limited ability to protect our proprietary information and technology may adversely affect our ability to compete 
many of our products consist entirely or partly of proprietary technology owned by us 
although we seek to protect our technology through a combination of copyrights  trade secret laws  contractual obligations and patents  these protections many not be sufficient to prevent the wrongful appropriation of our intellectual property  nor will they prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and certain vendors have become more sophisticated and aggressive in reverse engineering even complex technology and then mass producing such technology at a lower cost than we might be able to achieve 
in order to defend our proprietary rights in the technology utilized in our products from third party infringement  we may be required to institute legal proceedings 
if we are unable to successfully assert and defend our proprietary rights in the technology utilized in our products  our future results could be adversely affected 
our products could infringe the intellectual property rights of others  and resulting claims against us could be costly and require us to enter into disadvantageous license or royalty arrangements 
although we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in our product development efforts  we expect that we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims for alleged infringement from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
any claims relating to the infringement of third party proprietary rights  even if not meritorious  could result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  require us to reengineer or cease sales of our products or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us 
in addition  parties making claims may be able to obtain an injunction  which could prevent us from selling our products in the united states or abroad 
some of our products require technology that we must license from the manufacturers of systems with which our products must be compatible 
the success of our proprietary mcu products  in particular  relies upon our ability to acquire and maintain 
table of contents licensing arrangements with the various manufacturers of dlc systems for the proprietary design integrated circuits pdics unique to each 
although most of our pdic licensing agreements have perpetual renewal terms  all of them can be terminated by either party 
if we are unable to obtain the pdics necessary for our mcu products to be compatible with a particular dlc system  we may be unable to satisfy the needs of our customers 
furthermore  future pdic license agreements may contain terms comparable to  or materially different than  the terms of existing agreements  as dictated by competitive or other conditions 
the loss of these pdic license agreements  or our inability to maintain an adequate supply of pdic s on acceptable terms  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our reliance on third parties to manufacture certain aspects of our products involves risks  including  delays in product shipments and reduced control over product quality 
we depend upon a limited number of third party subcontractors to manufacture certain aspects of our products 
furthermore  the components of our hardware products are procured from a limited number of outside suppliers 
our reliance upon such third party contractors involve several additional risks  including reduced control over manufacturing costs  delivery times  reliability and quality components 
although our products generally use industry standard products  some parts  such as asics  are custom made to our specifications 
if we were to encounter a shortage of key manufacturing components from limited sources of supply  or experience manufacturing delays caused by reduced manufacturing capacity or integration issues related to our acquisition of the cheetah product line  the loss of key assembly subcontractors or other factors  we could experience lost revenues  increased costs  delays in  cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments  any of which would materially harm our business 
product quality  performance and reliability problems could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
our customers demand that our products meet stringent quality  performance and reliability standards 
we have  from time to time  experienced product quality  performance or reliability problems 
for example  in  we were unable to ship certain of our transponder products to a customer due to delays in both the cablelabs docsis certification of these products and the manufacturing of the product until final engineering enhancements were completed 
though we received cablelabs certification in the third quarter of  we are still working to resolve final technological product matters which continue to delay our manufacturing and deployment of this product 
as a result  defects or failures have in the past  and may in the future occur relating to our product quality  performance and reliability 
if these failures or defects occur or become significant  we could experience lost revenues  increased costs  including inventory write offs  warranty expense and costs associated with customer support  delays in or cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts  any of which would harm our business 
we have completed  and may pursue additional acquisitions  which will complicate our management tasks and could result in substantial expenditures  and the failure of acquired assets to meet expectations could result in impairment of intangible assets 
we have completed  and we may pursue additional acquisitions of companies  product lines and technologies as part of our efforts to enhance our existing products  to introduce new products and to fulfill changing customer requirements 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the disruption of our business  exposure to assumed or unknown liabilities of the acquired target  and the failure to integrate successfully the operations and products of acquired businesses 
goodwill arising from acquisitions may result in significant charges against our operating results in one or more future periods 
furthermore  we may never achieve the anticipated results or benefits of an acquisition  such as increased market share or the successful development and sales of a new product 
the effects of any of these risks could materially harm our business and reduce our future results of operations 
in addition  the carrying value of certain of our intangible assets  consisting primarily of goodwill related to our loopcare software and cheetah product line acquisitions from lucent technologies  inc and acterna  llc  could be impaired by changing market conditions 
we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization and lower than anticipated cash flows produced by such intangible assets 
if our stock price and market capitalization decline  or if we do not realize the expected revenues from an intangible asset  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of that intangible asset is determined which could have a negative effect on our financial condition 
our future sales in international markets are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
we have limited experience selling our products internationally  and our future sales in international markets are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including local economic and labor conditions  political instability including terrorism and other acts of war or hostility  unexpected changes in the regulatory environment  trade protection measures  tax laws  our ability to market current or develop new products suitable for international markets  difficulties with deployments and acceptances of products  
table of contents obtaining and maintaining successful distribution and resale channels and foreign currency exchange rates 
reductions in the demand for or the sales of our products in international markets could adversely affect future results 
if our accounting controls and procedures are circumvented or otherwise fail to achieve their intended purposes  our business could be seriously harmed 
although we evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of each fiscal quarter  and have completed the process of reviewing and establishing internal control over financial reporting for the year ended december  in order to comply with sec rules relating to internal control over financial reporting adopted pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of  we may not be able to prevent all instances of accounting errors or fraud in the future 
our controls and procedures do not provide absolute assurance that all deficiencies in design or operation of these control systems  or all instances of errors or fraud  will be prevented or detected 
these control systems are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the goals of these systems in light of legal requirements  our resources and nature of our business operations 
these control systems remain subject to risks of human error and the risk that controls can be circumvented for wrongful purposes by one or more individuals in management or non management positions 
our business could be seriously harmed by any material failure of these control systems 
if we ship products that contain defects  the market acceptance of our products and our reputation will be harmed and our customers could seek to recover their damages from us 
our products are complex  and despite extensive testing  may contain defects or undetected errors or failures that may become apparent only after our products have been shipped to our customer and installed in their network or after product features or new versions are released 
any such defect  error or failure could result in failure of market acceptance of our products or damage to our reputation or relations with our customers  resulting in substantial costs for both the company and our customers as well as the cancellation of orders  warranty costs and product returns 
in addition  any defects  errors  misuse of our products or other potential problems within or out of our control that may arise from the use of our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers 
our customers could seek to have us pay for these losses 
although we maintain product liability insurance  it may not be adequate 
our future results are dependent on our ability to establish  maintain and expand our distribution channels and our existing third party distributors 
we market and sell certain of our products  including our digitest and cheetah product lines  through domestic and international oem relationships 
our future results are dependent on our ability to establish  maintain and expand third party relationships with oem as well as other marketing and sales distribution partners 
if  however  the third parties with whom we have entered into such oem and other partnerships should fail to meet their own performance objectives  customer demand for our products could be adversely affected  which would have an adverse effect on our revenues 
we face intense competition  which could result in our losing market share or experiencing a decline in our gross margins 
the markets for some of our products are very competitive 
some of our competitors may have greater technological  financial  manufacturing  sales and marketing  and personnel resources than we have 
as a result  these competitors may have an advantage in responding more rapidly or effectively to changes in industry standards or technologies 
in addition  we face competition from overseas manufacturers  who might reverse engineer our proprietary technology and manufacture such products at a lower cost than we can achieve 
moreover  better financed competitors may be better able to withstand the pricing pressures that increased competition may bring 
if our introduction of improved products or services is not timely or well received  or if our competitors reduce their prices for products that are comparable to ours  demand for our products and services could be adversely affected 
we may also compete directly with our customers 
generally  we sell our products either directly  or indirectly through oem channels and other means  to end user telecommunications and cable television providers 
it is possible that our customers  as the result of bankruptcy or other rationales for dismantling network equipment  could attempt to resell our products 
the successful development of such a secondary market for our products by a third party could negatively affect demand for our products  reducing our future revenues 
we are dependent upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate our key personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate the key management and technical personnel necessary to implement our business plan and to grow our business 
despite the adverse economic conditions of the past several years  competition for certain specific technical and management skill sets is intense 
if we are unable to identify and hire the personnel that we need to succeed  or if one or more of our present key employees were to cease to be associated with the company  our future results could be adversely affected 
further  if key employees that cease to be associated with the company become associated with our competitors in violation of restrictions on competition or confidentiality  it could adversely affect future results 

table of contents consolidations in  or a continued slowdown in  the telecommunications industry could harm our business 
we have derived a substantial amount of our revenues from sales of products and related services to the telecommunications industry 
the telecommunications industry has experienced significant growth and consolidation in the past few years 
over recent years  trends indicate that capital spending by this industry has decreased and may continue to decrease in the future as a result of a general decline in economic growth in local and international markets 
in particular  rboc and large ilec customers have been adversely affected by subscriber line losses and the after effects of overspending in and as well as by competition from cable and wireless carriers and other carriers entering the local telephone service market 
certain emerging carriers also continue to be hampered by financial instability caused in large part by a lack of access to capital 
in the event of further significant slowdown in capital spending of the telecommunications industry  our business would be adversely affected 
consolidations could cause our customers to divert spending from our products to acquisition and integration costs 
furthermore  as a result of industry consolidation  there may be fewer potential customers requiring our software in the future 
larger  consolidated telecommunications companies may also use their purchasing power to create pressure on the prices and the margins we could realize 
we cannot be certain that consolidations in  or a slowdown in the growth of  the telecommunication industry will not harm our business 
our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  and we may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for unexpected revenue shortfalls 
we base our expense levels in part on forecasts of future orders and sales  which are extremely difficult to predict 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses is related to personnel  facilities and sales and marketing 
the level of spending for such expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is  therefore  relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  our operating results will be harmed if revenues fall below our expectations in a particular quarter 
our restructuring plan may be ineffective or may limit our ability to compete 
we have recently undertaken a reduction in work force in response to our evolving business model these actions could have long term adverse effects on our business 
there are several risks inherent in our efforts to bring our cost base in line with the current environment by reducing our workforce 
these include the risk that we will not be successful in achieving our planned cost reductions  and that even if we are successful in doing so  we will still not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough to see a positive profitability effect and may have to undertake further restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges and create additional risks 
in addition  there is the risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair our ability to effectively develop and market products and remain competitive 
each of the above measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  making it more difficult for us to respond to customers  limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could cause our earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be 
we rely on software that we have licensed from third party developers to perform key functions in our products 
we rely on software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
we could lose the right to use this software or it could be made available to us only on commercially unreasonable terms 
although we believe that alternative software is available from other third party suppliers or internal developments  the loss of or inability to maintain any of these software licenses or the inability of the third parties to enhance in a timely and cost effective manner their products in response to changing customer needs  industry standards or technological developments could result in delays or reductions in product shipments by us until equivalent software could be developed internally or identified  licensed and integrated  which would harm our business 
we are affected by a pattern of product price decline in certain markets  which can harm our business 
because our cable products generate lower margins for us than our proprietary mcu and software offerings  an increase in the percentage of our sales of cable related products relative to our traditional products will result in lower profitability 
furthermore  as consolidations within the cable industry and the adoption of the docsis standards have caused and could continue to cause pricing pressure as competitors lower product pricing  our revenues have been and may continue to be adversely affected 
although we have developed docsis compliant hardware and our relationship with alpha is one that we believe will prominently position us to succeed in the marketing of docsis products  these docsis products will likely generate lower margins than have historically been generated by our proprietary technology 
as a result  as our business shifts from our higher margin proprietary products to lower margin cable offerings and standardized products for which we have competition  we will need to sell greater volumes of our products to maintain our profitability 

table of contents our common stock price may be extremely volatile 
our common stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the market price may vary in response to many factors  some of which are outside our control  including general market and economic conditions  actual or anticipated variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or new services by us or by our competitors or customers  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  announcements by our customers regarding end market conditions and the status of existing and future infrastructure network deployments  additions or departures of key personnel  and future equity or debt offerings or our announcements of these offerings 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the securities of technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies 
these broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future materially and adversely affect our stock price  regardless of our operating results 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources that could harm our business 
we may be subject from time to time to legal proceedings  and any adverse determinations in these proceedings could materially harm our business 
we may from time to time be involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
litigation matters are inherently unpredictable  and we cannot predict the outcome of any such matters 
if we ultimately lose or settle a case  we may be liable for monetary damages and other costs of litigation 
even if we are entirely successful in a lawsuit  we may incur significant legal expenses and our management may expend significant time in the defense 
an adverse resolution of a lawsuit or legal proceeding could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations

overview communication plays an integral part of our society  it is  in reality  a necessity of life 
telecommunication services provide people with a means to communicate with people across the street and around the globe  through diverse channels ranging from traditional wired telephone service to wireless telephones to electronic means such as e mail and other internet based offerings 
as a leading producer of network assurance and monitoring systems for wired networks  our products permit service providers to supply their customers with consistent and high quality telecommunications offerings  allowing  for example  telephone companies to diagnose and assess problems within their networks and cable operators to monitor the power supplies necessary to operate their systems 
as a result of the rapid technological  regulatory and economic evolution of the telecommunications marketplace which we define to include cable television service over the past several years  we believe that it is our challenge  and our opportunity  to leverage our embedded base of customers and dominant market position to address the testing and monitoring needs of new system architectures by offering products addressing such needs that represent relatively small incremental investments in customers existing testing and monitoring systems 
we want to provide our customers with the ability to seamlessly transition from one network to another with comparatively minimal capital investments in existing testing solutions 
the downturn in the telecommunications industry revealed several trends that we expect will continue to impact our business incumbent telephone carriers continue to lose customers and revenue to smaller  independent carriers many of whom are developing their own networks and intend to compete on price  although cable providers have taken the lead in the broadband service market  primarily because cable modem technology was perfected before dsl technology and because telephone providers are regulated much more than cable companies  the rate of adoption of dsl technology is quickly growing  and both cable and telephone companies as well as the providers of satellite  wireless and other information mediums are eager to market the so called triple play of voice  data and video broadband services 
as a result of these trends  our traditional customer base of incumbent telephone carriers especially the rbocs have considerably slowed their investments in plain old telephone service pots line capacity relative to their capital investment patterns of the late s through instead  some of these providers  from which we derive a large percentage of our revenue  are focusing their capital spending on wireless and next generation wireline projects such as dsl service and fiber to the premises fttp or fiber to the node fttn collectively  fttx 
additionally  cable companies have sought to capitalize on their present technological advantages by aggressively marketing their broadband services  in fact  due in part to the advent of wireless telephone service and internet based services  such as voice over internet protocol voip  cable providers are well positioned to promote the utility of cable broadband service over the need to maintain both wired telephone and cable services 
although we remained generally profitable during the industry downturn  during that period we analyzed  and continue to analyze  our product offerings relative to the needs of the marketplace 
over the past several years  in addition to reorganizing our workforce  we have diversified our product offerings both through our acquisitions and development of new products  especially those aimed at the broadband test market 
as a result of our acquisition in of our cheetah cable product line  we believe that we have become a leading provider of status monitoring products for the cable industry 
including services  approximately of our revenue was generated by cable product sales 
this is consistent with cable revenue which was approximately of revenue 
we believe that the recently consummated alliance with alpha  the leading provider of cable power management products  should position us to sustain our leading position in the cable field in the wake of the recent adoption of the standardized hms and data over cable service interface specifications docsis protocols for transponders that may in the future render some of our proprietary cable hardware products obsolete 
with respect to our telephony products  although we do not predict that our sales of our core mcu products will reach the levels seen in  we continue to be encouraged by recent mcu sales in conjunction with large scale projects  most notably the building out of both pots networks by competitive service providers and dsl systems by the rbocs 
with regard to dsl  we plan to market our digitest system as a tool to measure a network s capacity to offer dsl service 
we have also in the past several years placed a greater emphasis on developing and marketing software applications that conform to industry needs  such as docsis and fiber optic only networks 

table of contents the result of our expanded cable and software offerings and changes in the industry generally is that our customer mix has changed and will continue to change  a factor which we expect will make us much less susceptible to the capital spending habits of a few select large customers 
however  despite our relative success in remaining profitable during the past several years  we believe that there is still too much uncertainty in the marketplace to allow us to accurately predict the eventual direction that the telecommunications industry will take  or how our business might fit within that new model 
moreover  given the lower margins generated by our cable products relative to our proprietary mcu and software offerings  changes in our product mix may cause our overall profitability to decrease 
industry and market trends in the past  consumers had little choice in the range of available telecommunication services which was limited primarily to hardwire telephone lines or the number of providers of such services almost exclusively restricted to incumbent local exchange carriers 
this combination of limited services and providers  coupled with governmental regulation of the industry  meant that if consumers wanted telephone service  they bought it from the company designated by the government at a price approved by the government 
over the past several years  the telecommunications market which we define to include cable television service has undergone a rapid technological  regulatory and economic evolution 
contemporaneously with the downturn in the telecommunications industry  several trends emerged that we expect to continue to affect our business 
intense competition among telecommunications service providers the continuing evolution of the telecommunications marketplace  driven by advances in technology as well as the deregulation of the industry  among other factors  has resulted  and will continue to result  in intense competition among telecommunications and cable service providers 
many consumers now have the ability to choose among a variety of comparable telecommunication services offered by a number of different providers 
although many of interconnection and unbundling provisions of the telecommunications act of were struck down in by the us court of appeals  the deregulation of the industry over the past eight years has allowed certain consumers to obtain local telephone service from either their incumbent local exchange carrier  which in the old regulatory environment possessed the exclusive right to provide that service  or by one or more competitive service providers  which may actually provide telephone service over the network owned by that same local exchange carrier but at a lower cost 
moreover  consumers may choose from a growing list of communications options that provide the same level of service once reserved to the local telephone company 
the proliferation of wireless telephone service  for instance  now allows a consumer to place calls from nearly any location in the united states  and from most parts of the world 
using voip  a person may place a call from a voip phone either to another voip customer or to a hardwired or wireless telephone number 
as a result  the provision of telecommunication services in certain markets today is highly competitive  and the industry  in general  is rapidly transforming from a highly regulated monopolistic model to more of a free market model 
although these evolutionary factors have adversely affected our business to varying degrees over the past three years  we believe that it is still too early to adequately assess the long term effect of these changes on the company 
because our products are sold primarily to telephone and cable television companies  of which there are still a relatively limited number  the loss of any of our customers could translate into reduced demand for our offerings  especially our test system and test access hardware products 
conversely  the introduction of competition into the marketplace has helped to bring new customers to us  including the increasing number of competitive service providers which are building out new networks instead of leasing capacity on incumbent carrier networks and cable companies which are expanding or upgrading their systems to meet the increasing demand for broadband and telephone services 
telephone companies  especially the rbocs  have also been attempting to meet the demand for broadband services  with the build out of their dsl networks  which in some instances has resulted in increased demand for our mcu products 
the result  however  of the expansion of the broadband market will likely be the continued reduction in demand for pots service  potentially depressing overall mcu sales 
downturn in telecommunications industry the downturn in the telecommunications industry  began in early and persisted into the downturn was caused by a number of factors  including the general slowdown of the us and global economies during the period  network overcapacity  constrained capital markets and financial difficulties among certain telecommunication providers  especially competitive local exchange carriers clecs whose business models did not produce the profitability necessary to justify their significant ongoing capital consumption  a problem due in part to continuing regulatory hurdles during the downturn that impeded competitive access to the telecommunications infrastructure 
many clecs as a result were forced to seek bankruptcy protection  a number of which remain there today 
some clecs are being purchased and consolidated in the process  while others are emerging or set to emerge with stronger capital structures to meet the competitive challenge 
those independent clecs which are in or have currently emerged from bankruptcy protection now must face an even tougher competitive landscape in light of the us court of appeals decision to strike down many of the competitive advantages in interconnection and unbundling rules that were granted to the clecs under the telecommunications act of the ultimate effect however has been that many clecs must now build their own switched networks to survive  and that in turn may create demand for loopcare and digitest products which can serve as the testing back bone for these build outs 
as a result  we are making additional investments in this market 
we benefited greatly from the increased capital spending of telecommunication providers during the late s and into as the rbocs and others built out new and upgraded existing networks during the period  tremendous demand for our products resulted in very high levels of profitability 
although we remained generally profitable during the industry downturn that followed  during that period we analyzed  and continue to analyze  our product offerings relative to the needs of the marketplace 
over the past several years  in addition to reorganizing our workforce  we have diversified our product offerings both through our acquisitions of the loopcare software and cable based cheetah product lines and through our development of new products  
table of contents especially those aimed at the broadband test market  such as digitest edge 
we believe that our ongoing diversification efforts  some of which have had the secondary effect of bringing new customers to the company thus reducing our reliance on the rbocs  will strategically position us to compete in the evolving marketplace 
complicating our ability to assess our market space in the telecommunications industry is the uncertainty driven by the deregulatory efforts of various government entities  especially at the federal level 
deregulation has actually resulted in the imposition of additional regulations that affect certain telecommunications services and providers  including changes to pricing  access by competitive vendors and other broad changes to data and telecommunications networks and services 
as the federal communications commission fcc and other government agencies continue to enact new or amend existing regulations  especially relating to the telecommunications act of  our customers cannot always accurately interpret or predict the rules by which they will be required to compete in the marketplace 
these changes in the regulation of the telecommunications industry in the united states have had a major impact on our customers  especially on their pricing of services  and may affect their deployment of future services 
we do not believe that we can accurately predict when these issues will be resolved  or that this deregulatory effort will continue in the future 
consolidation in telecommunications market competition in the telecommunications market  encouraged and affected by these deregulatory efforts  has had the secondary effect of resulting in the consolidation of many of the telecommunications service providers 
in some ways  we have benefited from the increased competition in the industry  competition has brought more providers into the market that may need our products to provide consistent and quality telecommunications services 
however  as a result of industry consolidations  including those in the clec market  we have experienced and could continue to experience disruption of our existing customer relationships  delays or loss of customer orders and pricing pressures caused by the reduction in the number of customers desiring our products 
these trends cause decreased revenues and lower net income 
as stated above  however  we believe that it is too early to predict the course that industry consolidations will take in the future  or how such consolidations might affect our revenues 
further  our major customers are currently actively pursuing acquisitions to add to their product offerings  such as the rbocs acquiring wireless capabilities 
we do not currently sell products to wireless carriers  accordingly  these acquisitions could cause our customers to decrease spending in traditional areas as they divert funding to these acquisitions and integrations 
slowdown in build out of pots networks the most evident market trend to affect our results in the years from through compared to was the general slowdown in the build out of pots networks by the rbocs and other independent local exchange carriers 
in the years immediately preceding  companies expanded their pots line capacity at the rate of approximately per year 
this line growth resulted in extremely high demand for our mcu products 
beginning in  however  a number of factors converged to slow the growth of pots networks 
perhaps the most important factor was the declining demand for wired telephone service  known as  line loss  in essence  telephone companies were  and still are  losing more customer lines than they are adding 
line loss has resulted from a number of trends  including competition from wireless telephone providers and the reduction in the need for multiple telephone lines  driven in part by the increasing popularity of dsl which is normally accessed though a household s primary hardwire telephone line and cable modems for broadband access to the internet 
although we do not believe that wireless service will entirely supplant the need for wired telephone service  we do expect that wireless telephones  as well as other alternatives to traditional telephones such as voip  will continue to erode the demand for pots service  the extent of such reduced demand  however  is difficult to predict at this time 
however  many cable operators are deploying or intend to deploy voip  which may serve to stimulate additional sales of our cable status monitoring products 
investment in new network infrastructure and technologies although telephone companies are not focusing on their pots networks as much as they once did  they are still investing in their network infrastructure 
generally  the combination of increased competition and reduced revenues in recent years has left the telephone companies with less funds available for capital investment 
we are encouraged  however  by several trends  including the previously discussed movement by competitive carriers to build pots networks rather than leasing network space from incumbent carriers  additional pots capacity may result in telecommunications test equipment sales 
furthermore  a majority of the rbocs have  at present  announced varying increases in their capital budgets for over rather than investing in pots  however  increasing portions of these capital budgets are being allocated to other projects  such as wireless  dsl rollouts  atm switches and fttx projects 
we have benefited from certain dsl projects in the past  such as sbc s dsl footprint expansion initiative  which resulted in increased demand for our mcu products 
if implemented on a large scale  fttp projects  which would provide broadband services through a direct fiber optic link between a telephone company s central office and the end user ie  individual households and businesses  will reduce demand for our mcu and digitest products 
unlike traditional hybrid networks in which our mcu products are deployed  fiber optic systems can be tested and managed with appropriate software including variations of our loopcare software 
we remain confident  based on recent announcements by certain of our rboc customers  that their existing hybrid fiber optic copper line networks will continue to be the medium through which the majority of pots services are delivered in the united states for the foreseeable future 
in addition  these rbocs are currently spending significant resources on upgrading these hybrid fiber optic copper line networks to provide broadband and eventually video signals 
although certain of our telephone company customers are indicating an interest in fttp projects  it still is not clear that fttp will be implemented on a large scale basis 
in fact  certain other of our rboc customers have indicated they will implement fttn projects rather than fttp 
in fttn projects  the fiber link will not extend to the customer s premises  rather  it will extend to the nodes in the network  by necessity leaving a portion of the copper network intact 
given the size and breadth of the present hybrid networks  including the billions of dollars invested in them  coupled with the billions of dollars required to replace them with all fiber optic lines  we believe that the copper portion of the network will remain an important part of 
table of contents the telecommunications system in the united states 
as long as that copper portion remains  as is contemplated in fttn projects  some need for traditional testing methods should continue 
unlike most of the existing telephone network  the hybrid fiber coaxial hfc networks maintained by the cable television companies are capable of providing broadband services with little additional capital investments 
in general  cable companies have been quite successful with their deployments of high bandwidth internet services 
since  we have offered our legacy cable formerly lighthouse hardware products to cable companies for the status monitoring of their networks  our recently acquired cheetah hardware products offer a similar proprietary system for the monitoring of hybrid fiber coax distribution systems 
the adoption of the hms standard and  increasingly  the docsis standard for cable modems by a growing number of cable companies  however  has the potential to eliminate the demand for certain of our proprietary cheetah head end hardware products  and to reduce demand for other proprietary cheetah offerings 
our responses to these industry trends although we are confident that we offer superior test system and status and performance monitoring products  the evolution of the telecommunication and cable networks requires us to constantly evaluate our product offerings relative to the needs of the industry 
we have taken a number of steps to attempt to position the company to take advantage of our leading position in certain of our markets  including the continued expansion of our cable television network monitoring and operations support system oss software product lines  each of which has served to expand our customer base 
expansion of cable status monitoring product line since  we have offered our legacy cable formerly lighthouse hardware and software products to cable companies for status monitoring of their networks 
in order to grow our cable status monitoring product line  on february  we purchased the cheetah product line from acterna  llc 
we believe that these products coupled with our lighthouse platform  represent the dominant monitoring products in the cable marketplace 
with the addition of the cheetah product line  we have become the supplier of status monitoring hardware and software to nearly every major cable company 
we believe our cheetah products complement and augment our other cable product offerings and strategically positions the company to be the leading supplier of testing equipment and software for the cable industry 
moreover  we have taken a proactive approach to the increasing adoption of the docsis standards by cable providers 
we have developed docsis monitoring hardware  which has been certified by cablelabs in certain configurations and is in the final stages of certain specific customer certifications 
additionally  in  we entered into an agreement with alpha technologies to be the exclusive supplier of ip based docsis status monitoring equipment for alpha power supplies used in hybrid fiber coax hfc networks 
by joining with alpha  we have aligned with the primary provider of power supply products to the cable industry to offer fully compatible and integrated docsis transponders 
we believe that as cable companies continue to leverage their growing docsis based hfc infrastructure to deliver voice  data and video services through a single conduit  we are well positioned to provide the range of quality assurance and testing products necessary to maintain our leading position in the cable marketplace 
further  much of the ip based network infrastructure is similar  whether implemented in a telephony or cable network 
as a result  we believe our development efforts for ip based testing solutions in the cable market may translate well to the telecommunications network 
development and marketing of software solutions along with our growing focus on the cable market  we have also increased our emphasis on developing and marketing software solutions for network assurance and testing 
given the increasing interest of the rbocs in fttx projects and the importance of software products to cable monitoring systems  we believe that our development of new software solutions will be an important determinant of our future success 
our loopcare software is already the dominant oss software for copper line networks 
because fiber only networks require primarily software solutions for network testing  we have actively promoted our ability to adapt our existing loopcare oss to serve fttx systems 
although we believe that it is much too early to determine the extent to which fttx projects will be implemented  we will continue to analyze the capital spending trends in the industry and will attempt to adjust our product offerings accordingly 
from to  we reorganized our internal structure to de emphasize existing hardware development efforts and  through our acquisitions  added significant capability in software engineering 
the most recent reorganizations occurred on july  and july  when we announced a cost alignment program which eliminated  in two phases  approximately positions 
the majority of the reduction affected our research and development  manufacturing  and related overhead areas 
on september   we announced a cost reduction initiative which included the elimination of positions  primarily in research and development 
we had additional cost alignment programs during that resulted in the elimination of positions 
of the nearly original positions eliminated  many related to hardware engineering and production activities 
conversely  many of the new employees are involved in software or system development 
as a result of these changes  we believe that we are now better prepared to develop the software products that we believe will in the future comprise a large component of the test assurance market 
although software products generally generate higher margin returns for us than our hardware products  the initial development costs of software applications  coupled with the inherent problems with pricing software sold to customers  can make it difficult to assess the potential profitability of a new software product 
unlike our mcu products  which are comprised of proprietary technology that requires little modification  unless we acquire proprietary software  we must internally develop any new software products 
software development is a relatively expensive process  especially considering the human costs involved  and can be a lengthy process 
pricing presents another challenge  because it is customary in our industry to sell perpetual enterprise licenses that cover an entire customer s operations  it can be difficult to assess  at the time of sale  the exact price that we should charge for a particular license 
initial pricing issues are somewhat lessened by the stream of revenue generated by the software maintenance 
table of contents agreements we normally enter into with our software customers  maintenance arrangements related to our loopcare and cheetah acquisitions in particular have elevated the revenues and importance of services business to our future success 
furthermore  the sales process for our software products  especially to our rboc customers  can be cumbersome 
the increasing trend is for strict business case scrutiny by rbocs relating to software sales  and for evidence of a shorter return on investment than was traditionally required to support a software purchase 
in addition  to ensure compatibility with their respective networks  these customers can require significant periods of time to test our software products prior to agreeing to purchase them 
this delay  coupled with the enterprise license nature of the software licenses that we typically offer  can lead to what we call lumpy software sales  meaning that software sales in one period are not necessarily indicative of future sales in the next period  our software revenues can follow unpredictable patterns  as our software products represent primarily one time purchases that gain the approval of our customers at varying rates 
as a result  although we are hopeful that our increased emphasis on software products will position us to meet the needs of the changing telecommunications marketplace  it is difficult to predict the market s acceptance of our software offerings or the rate at which such products will generate revenue for us 
we have placed this increasing emphasis on cable and software products as an avenue to replace the revenue historically generated by our core mcu products 
as the life cycle for mcu products continues to mature  and certain rbocs and other customers focus their capital spending on network improvements such as fttx rather than hybrid networks  demand for our mcu and existing digitest products will likely diminish 
as a result  even though we are confident because of the prominence of copper lines in telecommunications networks there will still be a market for mcu products  we expect that in general  sales of mcu products will decline over time 
nevertheless  we expect that mcu sales will continue to comprise a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our digitest product line  introduced in following development efforts with lucent and nortel  was originally targeted at sprint for its rollout of dsl service in several us markets 
digitest products initially produced substantial revenues for us 
between and  sprint purchased approximately million in digitest test heads 
in  however  sprint discontinued this project and curtailed its digitest purchases  resulting in a material decline in overall digitest sales since then 
to increase digitest sales  we are actively marketing the system as a replacement for  or upgrade to  the existing loop testing systems lts employed by the rbocs to target problems in their pots networks  we believe that digitest is a good replacement product for the existing ltss  which are decades old 
replacement parts for them are no longer produced 
despite our marketing efforts  however  except for small scale deployments in certain selected markets  the rbocs have yet to allocate significant capital resources to lts replacement projects  and we expect that in the current competitive environment  they will continue to attempt to utilize the existing lts equipment as long as possible 
as a result  we expect this market to develop over a longer period of time and on a more incremental basis than we originally anticipated 
increased features for our telecommunications products we have taken a number of steps to increase our presence in the telephony testing market space 
since its introduction  our pots digitest test head has undergone several significant developmental changes 
with the integration of the loopcare software  which we acquired in  with the digitest hardware  we now offer a complete integrated testing system to smaller customers such as competitive exchange carriers and international customers 
furthermore  as a result of extensive research and development efforts in and  we now offer our digitest edge product  which combines the reliability of our digitest pots testing system with our new broadband services option bso test capability 
the edge product is primarily targeted at the rboc dsl market  but does have applications in the competitive domestic and international markets 
we expect that once the dsl customer base of the rbocs reaches a level of maturity that supports higher measures of centralized testing  the edge will compete favorably with similar offerings in the market 
we remain hopeful that demand for the edge product  combined with increasing opportunities for sales of digitest pots systems to competitive carriers and rbocs for lts replacement projects  will represent a replacement revenue stream for declining mcu sales 
the continuing general trends of reduced mcu sales and increasing software and cable related product revenues  has resulted in the broadening of our customer base 
although we still rely on the rbocs for a large portion of our revenues  the percentage of our overall revenues generated from rboc customers has dropped from in and in to in this decrease is due in part to the reduced capital spending of the rbocs 
more importantly to us  however  have been our increasing sales to new customers  primarily cable companies and clecs 
as our cable monitoring products become more fully entrenched  clecs build out their own networks  and sales of our software to new customers increase  we expect that our dependence on the rbocs for a large portion of our revenue will continue to decrease in and beyond 
because our cable products generate lower margins for us than our proprietary mcu and software offerings  an increase in the percentage of our sales of cable related products relative to our traditional products will result in lower profitability 
furthermore  as consolidations within the cable industry and the adoption of the docsis standards have caused and could continue to cause pricing pressure as competitors lower product pricing  our revenues have been and may continue to be adversely affected 
although we are developing docsis compatible hardware and our relationship with alpha is one that we believe will prominently position us to succeed in the marketing of docsis products  these docsis products generate lower margins than have historically been generated by our proprietary technology 
as a result  as our business shifts from our higher margin proprietary products to lower margin cable offerings and standardized products for which we have competition  we will need to sell greater volumes of our products to maintain our profitability 
even with the adoption of docsis by many cable providers  we believe that there still is value in our proprietary cheetah status monitoring systems  especially for those customers who have already made significant investments in our cable products 

table of contents nevertheless  the further evolution of cable industry standards could and likely will eliminate the need for some of these proprietary products 
increased international sales because of the incompatibility of some of our products with the various technological standards employed abroad  including the mcu  our revenues from international sources historically have been immaterial 
in response  during  we reduced our international marketing staff 
since our mcu products are designed to meet the specifications of the hybrid copper fiber network in the united states  they have limited applications in the international markets 
our loopcare software products used in combination with digitest or edge  however  do have utility for international customers 
through our original equipment manufacturer oem relationship with lucent  our loopcare products have been sold internationally in conjunction with purchases of lucent hardware 
of particular note is our recent success with lucent technologies international in successfully bidding and obtaining a substantial piece of business with the saudi telecom company stc in saudi arabia 
although it is an as ordered contract  it contemplates the purchase of all of the company s broadband offerings in addition to loopcare software customization and an operating platform update effort 
product flow and acceptance  and therefore revenues  are currently largely expected to benefit  with some revenue into early furthermore  the company enjoys a stream of software maintenance revenue from international sources 
our cheetah product lines are also marketed internationally through oem relationships 
as demand for cable service internationally increases  we believe that our cable products in particular may offer an avenue to increasing our international sales  as worldwide cable standards do not differ materially from those supported by our products 
in the short term  the success of our loopcare  digitest and cheetah offerings will primarily be dependent on the efforts of our oem partners and in the competitiveness of our oem pricing model 
other company trends in addition to the industry and product trends that we have already discussed  our operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate from time to time as a result of various other factors  including the timing of orders from  shipments to  and acceptance of software by  the rboc customers and significant independent telephone companies 
this timing is particularly sensitive to various business factors unique to each of our larger customers  including their relationships with various organized labor groups and a continuing tendency to place large orders for shipment of hardware and software toward the end of a quarter  which may result in orders placed in one quarter not being filled until the next period 
in addition  the markets for some of our products  such as loopcare and digitest  are highly competitive 
due to the rapidly evolving market in which these products compete  additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources could further intensify the competition for these products 
we believe that the changes outlined above and others within the telecommunications marketplace  industry consolidation  as well as our continuing efforts to expand our customer base and product offerings  have required us to grant more favorable terms to some of our customers 
furthermore  certain customers have consolidated product purchases among their various divisions  translating into large bulk orders for our products 
there is a continuing trend  which is in part a result of our discounting programs  for these customers to place large bulk orders for large quantities of hardware and software products 
although we will continue to strive to meet the demands of our customers  which include delivery of quality products at an acceptable price on acceptable terms  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating acceptable terms and conditions with our customers or that these continuing efforts by our rboc customers to consolidate their inventory and product procurement systems will not cause fluctuations or delays in our order patterns 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the application of certain of these accounting principles is more critical than others in gaining an understanding of the basis upon which our financial statements have been prepared 
we deem the following accounting policies to involve critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition we market and sell test system hardware and related software to the telecommunications and cable television industries 
the company follows staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition for hardware and software sales 
this bulletin requires  among other things  that revenue should be recognized only when title has transferred and risk of loss has passed to a customer with the capability to pay  and that there are no significant remaining obligations of the company related to the sale 
the bulk of our hardware sales are made to rbocs and other large customers 
terms of these hardware sales are predominantly fob shipping point 
revenue is recognized for these customers upon shipment against a valid purchase order 
the timing of revenue recognition may require the judgment of management 
we reduce collection risk by requiring letters of credit or other payment guarantees for significant sales to new customers and or those in weak financial condition 
for software perpetual license fee and maintenance revenue  we follow not only sab  but also the aicpa s statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
these statements require that software license fee revenue be recorded only when evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the software has been delivered  and a customer with the capacity to pay has accepted the software  leaving no significant obligations on the part of the company to perform 
we require a customer purchase order or other written agreement to document the terms of a software order and written  unqualified acceptance from the customer prior to revenue recognition 
in certain limited cases  however  agreements provide for automatic customer acceptance after the passage of time from a pre determined event and we have relied on these provisions for an indication of the timing of revenue recognition 
in isolated cases for orders of custom software  or orders that require significant software customization  such as that associated with our contract with lucent for test gear deployment in saudi arabia  we employ contract accounting using the percentage of completion method  whereby 
table of contents revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost 
the revenue for orders with multiple deliverables such as hardware  software and or installation or other services may be separated into stand alone fair values if not already documented in the purchase order or agreement and where list prices or other objective evidence of fair value exists to support such allocation  in accordance with the provisions of eitf issue revenue will not be recognized for any single element until all essential elements are delivered and accepted 
our loopcare and other software customers usually enter into separate agreements for software maintenance upon expiration of the stated software warranty period 
maintenance agreements include software upgrades and bug fixes as they become available  however  newly developed features must be purchased separately 
post warranty maintenance for new features is either included under the current maintenance agreement without additional charge  and is considered in the maintenance agreement fees  or is separately charged upon expiration of the warranty 
depending upon the timing of the enhancement purchase and the length of the maintenance agreement  we must evaluate whether or not a portion of a perpetual right to use fee should be treated as post contract support to be deferred and recognized over the remaining life of the maintenance agreement 
software maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the period the respective arrangements are in effect 
revenue recognition  especially for software products  involves critical judgments and decisions that can result in material effects to reported net income 
intangible assets and goodwill we had net intangible assets and goodwill of million at december  primarily resulting from the acquisitions of the loopcare and cheetah product lines in september and february  respectively 
in connection with these acquisitions  we utilized the transitional guidance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which were issued in july sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and that goodwill  as well as any intangible assets believed to have an indefinite useful life  shall not be amortized for financial reporting purposes 
an independent valuation consultant assisted the company in identifying and valuing both the loopcare and cheetah intangible assets 
in connection with the assets acquired in the loopcare transaction  intangible assets of million were identified 
capitalized software valued at million was determined to have a definite useful life of five years and is being amortized over that period 
also identified were intangible assets related to the loopcare trade name of million  loopcare base software of million  and post warranty service agreements of million 
because of the longevity of the loopcare trade name  the fact that over of the original base software code that was developed in the s is still in use in the rbocs today and strong sales and resultant cash flows are expected indefinitely into the future  both of these related identified intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives 
with regard to the post warranty service agreements  these arrangements have been in place for many years and we believe that these annual agreements will be renewed into perpetuity due to their critical importance in the operations of the customers 
at the end of and  we had executed maintenance agreements with two of the four rbocs while negotiating agreements with the other two customers 
early in  we signed a two year agreement with one of the remaining rbocs 
we intend to maintain fixed fee arrangements for all maintenance contracts 
therefore  we believe that the non amortizing characteristics of these intangible assets will be preserved 
however  in the event negotiations would result in substantially less revenue to us than the current fixed fee agreements  the current fair value of these maintenance service agreements may be determined to be less than the million carrying value  perhaps materially so  resulting in a non cash charge against operating income and or commencement of amortization of the remaining fair value over its then determined useful life 
a similar analysis of the fair value of the maintenance service agreements would be required if any of our rboc customers would terminate or indicate a definite life for their respective maintenance service agreement for any reason 
in the cheetah acquisition  intangible assets of million were identified  of which base software valued at million and proprietary technology valued at million were determined to have a definite useful life of ten years and are being amortized over that period 
sales order backlog acquired in the transaction was valued at million and was substantially amortized at december  and fully amortized as of march  this product line has three or four dominant customers who have purchased and supported cheetah products for many years 
this provides a dominant market position for this product line 
as a result  the remaining identified intangible assets of customer base valued at million and cheetah trademark valued at million have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and  along with goodwill of million  are not being amortized 
as of january   we fully adopted the provisions of sfas no 
we have determined that we have only one reporting unit and have completed tests for goodwill impairment as of december  by comparing the aggregate market value of the company s stock with our book carrying value  including goodwill 
these tests indicated that there was no impairment of the goodwill carrying value 
from time to time  the market value of our stock temporarily declined to an amount below the book carrying value 
we believe that these instances were reflective of then current conditions in the telecommunications and general markets and not an indication of fair value 
however  future changes in circumstances  including a sustained decline in the aggregate market value of our stock  could necessitate a reconsideration of whether an impairment of goodwill carrying value has occurred  requiring an alternate testing of our fair value under guidance of sfas no 
in that event  impairment in value up to the full amount of the goodwill could be determined  resulting in an impairment loss to be recorded in our financial statements 
all other intangible assets were tested for impairment of carrying value as of december  using assumptions and techniques employed in the original valuation and following the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
specifically  the sum of the projected future cash flows to be derived from the loopcare developed product software was compared with the net book carrying value 
the impairment test for non amortizable intangible assets other than goodwill consisted of a comparison of the estimated fair value with carrying amounts 
the values of the loopcare trade name 
table of contents and cheetah trademark were measured using the relief from royalty method and discounted cash flow analyses were employed to test the value of the loopcare base software and post warranty maintenance service agreements and the value of the cheetah customer base 
these tests indicated that none of the intangible assets had impairment in carrying value 
the company plans to retest these assets annually as of december or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
this testing relative to impairments involves critical accounting estimates 
we relied upon our financial plan for and best estimates of revenues and cash flows for later years in measuring current values  however  these expectations may not be realized and future events and market conditions might indicate material impairment of value that could result in material charges to net income 
such a future situation would not  however  in and of itself affect our cash flow or liquidity 
inventory valuation we utilize a standard cost system that approximates first in  first out costing of the products 
standards are monitored monthly and changes are made on individual parts if warranted  otherwise standard costs are updated on all parts annually  normally in november of each year 
excess capacity is not included in the standard cost of inventory 
we evaluate our inventories on a monthly basis for slow moving  excess and obsolete stock on hand 
the carrying value of such inventory that is determined not to be realizable is reduced  in whole or in part  by a charge to cost of sales and reduction of the inventory value in the financial statements 
the evaluation process  which has been consistently followed  relies in large part on a review of inventory items that have not been sold  purchased or used in production within a one year period 
management also reviews  where appropriate  inventory products that do not meet this threshold but which may be unrealizable due to discontinuance of products  evolving technologies  loss of certain customers or other known factors 
as a result of this comprehensive review process  an adjustment to the reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory is normally made monthly 
inventory identified as obsolete is also discarded from time to time when circumstances warrant 
inventory realization is considered a critical accounting estimate since it relies in large part on management judgments as to future events and differing judgments could materially affect reported net income 
the expense for slow moving and obsolete inventory was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the valuation reserves increased million in  decreased by million in and remained flat in to a balance of million at december  inventory physically scrapped was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts was million as of december   compared with million as of december  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million  compared with million as of december  the allowance is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts 
we regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  and current conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
our credit provision for doubtful accounts was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
in fiscal  we recorded a credit for doubtful accounts as a result of the improvement in collectibility of specific customer accounts due to increased credit quality and resolution of disputes 
if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  or if other circumstances arise  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and an additional allowance could be required  which could have an adverse impact on our revenue 
income taxes we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  in reporting the effects of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
as of december   we had recorded net deferred tax liability of million 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million 
the change is related to a charge of million related to state net operating loss carryforwards  a full valuation allowance against certain state net operating losses and due to amortization of intangible assets for tax purposes 
we have evaluated all remaining deferred tax assets based on our current outlook and believe all remaining assets will be utilized 
additionally  during  we reviewed the components of our tax contingency reserve and reduced the liability by million 
this represented a change in estimate based on a tax audit of earlier years and on evaluation of current circumstances 
the impact of the state net operating loss carryforwards  state valuation allowance and the review of our tax contingency reserves resulted in a net charge of million 
net deferred tax assets are expected to continue to decrease in future years 
the timing of the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities and to a large extent the deferred tax assets are dependent upon uncertain future events and cannot be assumed to occur in the same tax years 
the state net operating loss carryforward relates primarily to tax losses arising in  a year in which the company had significant tax deductions arising from stock option exercises 
the majority of this carryforward is subject to state laws that allow a year carry forward period with a million limit on deductions in each year 
future realization of the recorded tax assets resulting from both timing differences and carryforward losses is dependent upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in future years 
during  we evaluated our ability to use net operating losses in the states of pennsylvania and new york 
based on our review and expectations of future state losses we have established reserve against these state net operating losses 
sfas no 
requires that a valuation allowance be recorded against a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that 
table of contents some or all of that deferred tax asset will not be realized and  accordingly  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded against the state tax carryforward deferred tax assets 
we believe that the recent business climate in the telecommunications industry is not permanent  however  based on our current tax structure we believe it is more likely than not that these net operating losses will not be realized in future years 
the company had a federal taxable loss in and will be able to carry this loss back to and should receive a refund of million 
we expect to have federal taxable income in future years 
warranty we provide warranty coverage on our various products 
terms of coverage range from up to one year on software to two to five years for hardware products 
we review products returned for repair under warranty on a quarterly basis and adjust the accrual for future warranty costs based upon cumulative returns experience 
we also evaluate special warranty problems for products with high return rates to correct the underlying causes and  where deemed necessary  to provide additional warranty expense for expected higher returns of these products 
warranty costs associated with software sales are also accrued based on the projected hours to be incurred during the warranty period normally three months 
the accounting for warranty costs involves critical estimates and judgments that can have a material effect on net income 
the warranty accrual decreased by million in  increased by million in  and decreased by million in to a balance of million at december  these areas involving critical accounting estimates are periodically reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors

this decrease in sales was associated primarily with two of the four rboc customers 
qwest purchased million less from us in than in  and sbc purchased million less in than although declining  we do expect mcu sales for the foreseeable future to continue to account for a meaningful portion of the company s revenue 
the continuing maturation of this product line  the rbocs trend of limiting capital spending in their traditional pots networks and the evolution of the transmission network towards end to end fiber are the key reasons we expect it to decline over time
