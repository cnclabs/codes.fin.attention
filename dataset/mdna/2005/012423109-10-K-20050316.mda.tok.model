overview we are a leading chemistry based drug discovery and development company  focused on identifying and developing novel biologically active small molecules with applications in the prescription drug market 
we engage in comprehensive chemistry research from lead discovery  optimization and development to commercial manufacturing and conduct cell and non cell based high throughput screening on a variety of biological targets 
we perform chemistry research for many of the leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and for our own internal research and development 
in addition to our chemistry contract services  we also conduct proprietary research and development to discover new therapeutically active lead compounds with commercial potential 
we anticipate that we would then license these compounds to third parties in return for up front service fees and milestone payments as well as recurring royalty payments if these compounds are developed into new commercial drugs 
in  our proprietary research and development activities led to the development  patenting and licensing of a substantially pure form of  and a manufacturing process for  the active ingredient in the non sedating antihistamine fexofenadine hcl marketed by sanofi aventis sa as allegra in the americas and as telfast elsewhere 
in addition  certain of our discovery technology contracts provide for us to receive milestone and royalty payments for discoveries that lead to commercial products 
our total revenue for was million  including million from our chemistry contract business and million revenue from our royalties on sales of allegra 
during we performed work for more than customers  including new customers 
we generated million in cash from operations and spent million in capital on our facilities and equipment  primarily related to the expansion of our manufacturing suites at organichem 
we recorded a net loss of million in  including million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment  library inventory impairment of million  property and equipment impairment of million  warrant issuance costs of million  a loss on an equity investment of million  and a restructuring charge of million 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and million in bank and other related debt  carrying a blended interest rate of approximately 
strategy we continue to execute a long term strategy to grow our platform chemistry services business while leveraging our proprietary technologies and capabilities to provide greater value to our customers and further growth for the company 
we have enhanced our chemistry service offerings with the addition of our high throughput screening expertise and technologies  the addition of eli lilly and co 
s natural product collection  the launch of our semi exclusive synthetic chemical libraries  and the completion of our diverse chemical sample collection 
we believe that the pharmaceutical industry is placing more emphasis on the quality and content of compound libraries and their related screening versus the quantity of the compounds 
we have also enhanced our service offerings with the addition of certain physical chemistry services to evaluate polymorphic forms and crystal habits and to evaluate salt selection for potential new drug candidates 
the acquisition of organichem strategically positions us to offer high quality clinical trial and large scale cgmp commercial production capabilities for our customers  as well as expertise in high potency and controlled drug substance manufacturing which provide higher profit margins 
we realized strategic benefits from our acquisition of organichem by successfully transitioning several of our customers clinical supply manufacturing projects from our smaller scale chemistry laboratories into the facilities of organichem 
organichem s largest customer  ge biosciences  is expected to discontinue purchases of one of the products that we sell to them by the third quarter of sales of this product totaled million  which represents of organichem s revenue and of total contract revenue for the year ended december  we expect ge biosciences remaining purchases of this product to all occur in the first half of and to decrease by from levels  with no revenues associated with this product after our objective is to recoup the revenues associated with these sales decreases through increased sales of another product to ge biosciences  as well as continued growth in the area of clinical supply manufacturing for advanced stage human trials 
we will continue to seek opportunities to add services and technologies that add value to our customers 
we are also evaluating opportunities to leverage our large scale cgmp production facilities at organichem  including identifying niche products to manufacture and sell as well as assessing complementary lines of business that support cgmp production 
we continue to advance our proprietary technologies and programs with the goal to generate licensing or other revenue opportunities 
our most near term licensing opportunity relates to intellectual property transferred to us from bms 
the intellectual property provides us with ownership of one of bms s pre clinical drug candidates  along with patent applications covering attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and other central nervous system indications 
while we continue to invest in this program  we are also in discussions to license this technology in exchange for a combination of up front license fees  milestones and royalty payments 
we expect to make a significant additional investment in this program in with a view to finalizing the selection of a compound or compounds with respect to which we expect to subsequently file an investigative new drug ind application with the united states food and drug administration fda for the purpose of commencing human clinical trials 
we also continue to utilize our proprietary technologies  including our biocatalysis and natural product capabilities  to further advance other early stage internal research programs in the fields of oncology  immunosuppresion and inflammation 
we have initiated an internal screening program to screen our own chemical and natural product collections with the goal of generating lead candidates 
if successful  we would seek a licensing partner at an appropriate research or developmental stage 
additionally  we continue to seek comprehensive chemistry research and supply agreements with our customers that incorporate several of our service offerings and span across the entire pharmaceutical research and development process  including access to our chemical compound and natural product libraries  performance of screening and other lead discovery activities  performance of lead optimization and pre clinical testing  and large scale manufacturing for clinical trials and commercial sale if the product meets regulatory approval 
under these comprehensive agreements  companies typically receive a combination of fees for performance and delivery of goods and services  as well as milestone and royalty payments should collaborative efforts lead to the discovery of new products that reach the market 
the business environment for chemistry outsourcing continues to be challenging 
our customers remained under budgetary pressures and continued to spend a greater portion of their research and development dollars on later stage development projects in in addition  in certain areas of our business there has been a significant increase in foreign competition that has substantially lower cost structures 
the lower cost structures result from parts of the world where salaries are a fraction of what they are in industrialized countries 
this trend has resulted in pricing pressures in the us and is impacting our ability to increase or maintain pricing on our customer contracts 
we expect the increase in competition from lower cost locations  such as asia and india  to continue 
we are pursuing a plan to establish lower cost foreign operations in singapore and india  and expect to commence operations in these locations in we believe the ability to offer customers a choice of business models and cost structures to meet their drug discovery needs will help to strengthen our competitive advantage while enabling us to maintain profit margins on our services 
we expect the trend of increased demand for our chemical development and early stage cgmp manufacturing that began in to continue through the competitive environment facing allegra also remained challenging during the past year 
the marketing of claritin as an otc drug  the subsequent marketing of generic alternatives to claritin  and health maintenance organization hmo programs attempting to direct consumers towards otc antihistamines  resulted in a decrease in sales of allegra compared to the prior year 
given the absence of guidance from sanofi aventis  we have incorporated in our earnings guidance up to a decline in royalty revenues for the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our operating cash flows 
as discussed in item of this form k  several generic manufacturers have filed anda applications with the fda seeking authorization to produce and market a generic version of allegra 
we and aventis pharmaceuticals have filed several patent infringement suits against these generic companies alleging infringement of certain us patents 
should we or aventis be unsuccessful in defending these patents we would experience a material decrease in operating cash flows 
mt 
prospect restructuring and impairments we continue to control our costs and seek opportunities to improve overall operating margins 
as part of this process  on may  we announced our restructuring plan to consolidate operations by relocating our mt 
prospect operations to our facilities in new york 
amri s proprietary biocatalysis technology platform  drug metabolism screening  research fermentation and chemical development technologies in mt 
prospect were relocated to new york and continue to be fully integrated with amri s drug discovery and development technologies 
the consolidation of these technologies resulted in the closure of the mt 
prospect research center during the fourth quarter of the consolidation was initiated as a result of a lack of anticipated growth in the company s chemical development services at the facility 
as a result of the restructuring  employees were terminated and employees were relocated to facilities in new york 
during we incurred restructuring costs related to the mt 
prospect research center restructuring totaling million  primarily related to termination benefits and asset disposal costs 
we also incurred million in costs related to the relocation of employees and equipment from mt 
prospect to albany  which are included in selling  general  and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of income 
we also recorded a million impairment charge in the second quarter of  in accordance with the provision of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
this impairment charge was required to write down the carrying value of the mt 
prospect facility and related machinery and equipment to its estimated fair value 
our decision to close the mt 
prospect facility and consolidate operations in new york  along with the impairment charges recognized in connection with our assessment of the impairment of the mt 
prospect property and equipment  were considered triggering events under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
accordingly  we conducted a goodwill impairment review as required under sfas as of june  and concluded that an impairment of the goodwill at the mt 
prospect reporting unit had occurred as of that date 
we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge based upon a valuation of the reporting unit prepared by an independent valuation advisor using a discounted cash flow approach 
we are currently marketing the mt 
prospect research center facility for sale 
the facility qualified for held for sale treatment in accordance with sfas no 
during the fourth quarter 
the long lived assets associated with mt 
prospect have been segregated to a separate line item on the consolidated balance sheet until they are sold and depreciation expense has ceased respective to those assets 
we anticipate that as a result of this restructuring  we will experience annual expense savings up to million starting in resulting from a reduction in facility and labor costs  however  these cost savings will be offset by increases in cost related to the start up of our offshore operations 
bothell library inventory write off and asset impairment in connection with the preparation of our results of operations for the quarter ended june   we completed an in depth review of the carrying value of our library inventories 
as previously disclosed  we made certain investments in which we believed would enhance our ability to market and sell our natural product libraries and achieve certain revenue targets 
we also disclosed that if we were not able to successfully execute against our business plan within certain time constraints  including the achievement of revenue targets  or if market conditions were less favorable than those projected by management  we might be required to write down the value of certain library assets and related goodwill and intangible assets 
after investing in expanded marketing and sales efforts  we were not able to achieve any sales or signed purchase commitments for our natural product libraries during the six months ended june  as a result of our review  we recorded a reserve of million to reduce the carrying value of our inventories 
the reduction in the carrying value of our library inventories reflects the less favorable market conditions than previously projected by management and an excess quantity and carrying value of inventory on hand compared to projected future sales revenue 
we continue to monitor the carrying value of our remaining natural product and lead finding sample collections for impairment 
if we are unable to meet forecasted revenues related to those assets or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  we may be required to write down all or a portion of the remaining value of certain compound library assets totaling million at december   resulting in a charge to operations 
in connection with our reduction in carrying value of natural product inventories  we also performed an assessment of the carrying value of our microbial cultures and related technologies 
the microbial cultures and related technologies are the starting materials and technology used in the development of the natural product libraries and therefore would be used to make incremental copies of the natural product libraries 
based on our assessment  we concluded that the carrying value of the microbial cultures and related technologies was not recoverable  and accordingly recorded an impairment charge of million representing the entire remaining carrying value of microbial cultures and related technologies 
we determined that the reduction in the carrying value of the bothell library inventories was a triggering event under sfas based on the results of our sfas analysis  we also recorded a million reduction in the fair value of our property and equipment at bothell based upon a valuation of these assets utilizing the assistance of an independent valuation advisor 
we determined that the write down of the inventory  microbial cultures  and property and equipment at bothell were triggering events under sfas and that the carrying value of our goodwill at the bothell reporting unit may be impaired 
accordingly  we conducted a goodwill impairment review as required under sfas as of june  and concluded that an impairment had occurred which resulted in a million goodwill impairment charge 
in calculating the goodwill impairment charge  the fair value of the bothell reporting unit was determined with the assistance of an independent valuation advisor using a discounted cash flow valuation approach 
significant assumptions used in this analysis include i expected future revenue growth rates  reporting unit profit margins  and working capital levels  ii a discount rate  and iii a terminal value multiple 
the revenue growth rates  working capital levels and reporting unit profit margins were based on management s best estimate of future results 
warrant issuance in march  we issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  with exercise prices ranging from to to bristol myers squibb company bms 
the exercise period for these warrants is years 
the issuance of these warrants results from a agreement whereby bms transferred intellectual property to us  providing us with ownership of one of bms s preclinical drug candidates  along with patent applications covering attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and central nervous system indications 
in connection with the agreement  in march  we elected to retain ownership of the technology and all improvements made to date by us  resulting in the issuance of the warrants to bms 
the issuance of these warrants satisfies all equity related obligations to bms and results in our full ownership of these preclinical drug candidates and related intellectual property 
such warrants  which had a value of million on the date of issuance  were charged to research and development costs with a corresponding credit to stockholders equity during the period ended march  the value of warrants issued was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
equity investment impairment in  we received warrants  valued at million  to purchase preferred equity in a privately owned drug discovery company 
we are accounting for this investment under the cost method as we do not exert significant influence in the company 
this investment was included in investment in unconsolidated affiliates on the consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the fair value of this investment quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the investment value may not be recoverable 
in the fourth quarter of  this entity attempted to raise additional financing in order to fund its operations  but was unable to secure such financing on acceptable terms 
as such  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our investment based on an analysis of the investment s current financial condition  its prospects of generating additional cash flow from operating activities  the current market conditions for raising capital funding for companies in this industry and the likelihood that any funding raised would significantly dilute our ownership percentage 
as a result of this analysis it was our judgment that an other than temporary impairment had occurred and that the fair value of our investment was zero  resulting in a non cash loss on investment of million 
results of operations effective january   we began consolidating our financial results with organichem corporation 
for the period january  through february   our consolidated financial results reflect a ownership of organichem 
effective february   the date of our purchase of the remaining ownership of organichem  our financial results reflect ownership of organichem 
as a result  our revenues and operating expenses in include the results for organichem 
during  we included our proportionate share of organichem s net income in our income statement as equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates 
operating segment data we have organized our sales  marketing and production activities into the albany molecular research amr and organichem segments based on the criteria set forth in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we rely on an internal management accounting system to report results of these segments 
the accounting system includes revenue and cost information by segment 
we make financial decisions and allocate resources based on the information it receives from this internal system 
the amr segment includes activities such as drug lead discovery  optimization  drug development and small scale manufacturing 
the organichem segment includes pilot to commercial scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates and high potency and controlled substance manufacturing all of which are in compliance with the food and drug administration s fda current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp 
contract revenue contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers 
our contract revenues for each of our amr and organichem segments were as follows year ended december  in s amr organichem total contract revenue for amr for was million  a decrease of compared to contract revenue of million in the reduction in our contract services was attributable to continued offshore competition  pricing pressures and reductions in chemistry spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  primarily in our discovery services area 
we see the trends of offshore competition and pricing pressures continuing  and we have pursued strategies to establish lower cost foreign operations in singapore and india  and expect to commence operations in these locations in while the revenue from our offshore operations is not expected to be material to consolidated contract revenue in  we believe the ability to offer customers a choice of business models and cost structures to meet their drug discovery needs will help to strengthen our competitive advantage 
we expect the trend of increased demand for our development and small scale manufacturing services that began in the second half of to continue through  with flat demand for discovery services 
contract revenue at organichem declined by million  or to million in compared to million in the decline in contract revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from its second largest customer due to the timing of delivery requirements from this customer 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in demand for clinical supply manufacturing for advanced stage human trials 
organichem s largest customer  ge biosciences  is expected to discontinue purchases of one of the products that we sell to them by the third quarter of sales of this product totaled million  which represents of organichem s revenue and of total contract revenue for the year ended december  we expect ge biosciences remaining purchases of this product to all occur in the first half of and to decrease by from levels  with no revenues associated with this product after our objective is to recoup the revenues associated with these sales decreases through increased sales of another product to ge biosciences  as well as continued growth in the area of clinical supply manufacturing for advanced stage human trials 
contract revenue for amr for was million  a decrease of compared to contract revenue of million in the reduction in our contract services was attributable to reduced spending by our customers due to a weak economic environment  leading to budgetary pressures within the pharmaceutical and biotech industries 
additionally  an increase in foreign competition operating with lower cost structures impacted certain areas of our business during contract revenue at organichem declined by million  or to million in compared to the decline in contract revenue was attributable to soft demand from our customers due to a weak economic environment 
recurring royalties we earned royalties under our licensing agreement with sanofi aventis sa for the active ingredient in allegra telfast 
royalties were as follows year ended december  in s recurring royalties decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales of allegra telfast by sanofi aventis  due to over the counter competition from allegra s primary competitor  claritin 
the marketing of claritin as an over the counter otc drug  the subsequent marketing of generic alternatives to claritin  and health maintenance organization hmo programs attempting to direct consumers towards otc antihistamines  contributed to the decline in royalties 
we expect otc competition from claritin to continue in  as well as increased competition from the introduction of new prescription antihistamines into the united states market 
as such  we expect as much as a decline in royalty revenues in recurring royalties for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to million for the increase was attributable to increased sales and market share of allegra telfast by sanofi aventis 
cost of contract revenue cost of contract revenue  from which we derive gross profit from contract revenue  consists primarily of compensation and associated fringe benefits for employees  chemicals  depreciation and other indirect costs 
cost of contract revenue for our amr and organichem segments were as follows year ended december  in s amr organichem total amr gross margin organichem gross margin total gross margin amr had a contract revenue gross margin of for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in the decline in gross margin largely resulted from the write down of our natural product and chemical library inventories of million and million in additional raw material inventory write downs  as well as the decline in contract revenues in relation to the fixed cost components of amr s contract business 
in addition  we recorded million of amortization on our chemical library inventories during we expect amr s contract revenue gross margin to improve in due to a reduction in inventory charges  slight increases in contract revenues  and the recognition of cost savings due to the closure of mount prospect  partially offset by an expected increase in library inventory amortization  start up costs for our off shore operations and the recognition of compensation expense for stock options in organichem s contract revenue gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in the decline in gross margin is due primarily to the decline in production and sales volume in relation to the fixed cost components of organichem s contract business 
while we expect increased revenues at organichem in  gross margins are expected to continue to be under pressure 
for the year ended december   cost of contract revenue for amr increased million from due primarily to increased salary and related benefit costs for our scientific staff 
amr s contract revenue margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the decrease in amr s contract revenue margin was due to lower overhead absorption resulting from decreased contract revenues 
organichem s contract revenue margin increased to in from in as a result of cost reduction programs and synergies related to the acquisition 
included in organichem s cost of contract revenue in was million in purchase accounting expenses related to an increase in the value of inventories acquired in the acquisition 
technology incentive award we maintain a technology development incentive plan designed to stimulate and encourage novel technology development by our employees 
this plan allows eligible participants to share in a percentage of the net revenue earned by us relating to patented technology with respect to which the eligible participant is named as an inventor 
under our technology development incentive plan  thomas e 
d ambra  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  receives payments as the sole inventor of the patents for fexofenadine hcl equal to of the total payments received by us with respect to those patents 
the incentive award was as follows year ended december  in s the technology incentive award expense incurred under our technology development incentive plan decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the decrease was directly attributable to the decrease in allegra royalties in we expect technology incentive award expense to fluctuate directionally and proportionately with fluctuations in allegra royalties in future periods 
the technology incentive award expense incurred under our technology development incentive plan increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase was directly attributable to the increase in allegra royalties in compared to research and development research and development expense consists of compensation and benefits for scientific personnel for work performed on proprietary technology development  research projects  costs of chemicals and other out of pocket costs and overhead costs 
we utilize our expertise in small molecule chemistry  biocatalysis and natural products to perform our internal research and development projects 
the goal of these programs is to discover new compounds with commercial potential 
we would then seek to license these compounds to a third party in return for a combination of up front license fees  milestone payments and recurring royalty payments if these compounds are successfully developed into new drugs and reach the market 
in addition  research and development is performed at organichem related to the improvement of production processes as well as research related to the potential manufacture of new products 
research and development expenses were as follows year ended december  in s research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase is primarily attributable to million in expenses recorded for the issuance of warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock to bristol myers squibb bms in the first quarter of the warrants were issued in conjunction with an agreement whereby bms transferred intellectual property related to preclinical drug candidates and patent applications covering attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and central nervous system applications to the company 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with the design  research  and testing of the company s semi exclusive libraries 
research and development expenses are expected to decrease in due to the elimination of warrant issuance costs  and the redeployment of scientific personnel from semi exclusive library design and other internal research program initiatives to customer projects 
projecting expected project completion dates and anticipated revenue from our internal research programs is not practical at this time due to the early stages of the projects and the inherent risks related to the development of new drugs 
our internal central nervous system program is our most advanced opportunity to generate revenue  and we expect that a significant portion of our research and development costs will be incurred in the further development of this project 
we expect to make a significant additional investment in this program in with a view to finalizing the selection of a compound or compounds with respect to which we expect to subsequently file an investigative new drug ind application with the united states food and drug administration fda for purposes of commencing human clinical trials 
while we continue to invest in this program  we are also in discussions to license this technology in exchange for a combination of up front license fees  milestones and royalty payments 
in addition to our central nervous system program  the company also continues to utilize our proprietary technologies  including our biocatalysis and natural product capabilities  to further advance other early stage internal research programs in the fields of oncology  immunosuppresion and inflammation 
we budget and monitor our research and development costs by type or category  rather than by project on a comprehensive or fully allocated basis 
in addition  a significant portion of our research and development expenses is not tracked by project as it benefits multiple projects or our technology platform 
consequently  fully loaded research and development cost summaries by project are not available 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the consolidation of financial results with organichem added million in research and development costs in the generation of our novel chemical and screening collections and enhancement of our related high throughput screening technology added million of r d expenses in in addition  million of the increase related to the funding of our internal research program initiatives 
the continued development of our technologies primarily in biocatalysis and biosciences added an additional million of r d costs in due to the decline in demand for our contract business  we re allocated scientific personnel from customer projects to our internal research program initiatives 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense consists of compensation and related fringe benefits for marketing  operational and administrative employees  professional services  marketing costs and all costs related to facilities and information services 
selling  general and administrative expenses were as follows year ended december  in s the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is primarily due to professional fees related to our sarbanes oxley compliance initiatives and other accounting and valuation services of million  and million in employee and equipment relocation costs associated with the closure of the mount prospect facility 
these increases were partially offset by the elimination of million in abandonment costs associated with the relocation of our iowa operations in selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase overall in  due to increased compensation costs associated with the recognition of stock based compensation expense  administrative costs associated with our off shore operations  and general increases in overall administrative costs 
these increases are expected be partially offset by reductions in relocation costs and accounting fees  as well as administrative costs associated with the operation of the mount prospect facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of organichem  which had million in selling  general and administrative costs for  increased payroll related costs of million  and a million expense related to the relocation of our iowa operations 
impairment and restructuring charges as of june  we completed an in depth review of the carrying value of all of our natural product and chemical compound library inventories 
as a result of this review  which was based on expected future revenues  it was determined that a significant write down in the carrying value of library inventories was required 
the reduction in the carrying value of the library inventories reflects the less favorable market conditions than previously projected 
the write down of library inventories triggered an assessment of the recoverability of certain other related long lived assets and goodwill within the bothell reporting unit  including the goodwill and intangibles which resulted from the acquisition of new chemical entities nce  in accordance with the provisions of sfas and sfas based on our review  we determined that an impairment of certain related goodwill and long lived assets had occurred 
in addition  we initiated a restructuring which resulted in the closure of our mt 
prospect research center and the consolidation of mt 
prospect s operations in our new york facilities 
the restructuring triggered an assessment of the carrying value of the mt 
prospect research center property and equipment and related goodwill 
based on its review  and in accordance with the provisions of sfas and sfas  we determined that an impairment of certain related goodwill and property and equipment had occurred 
further  we incurred restructuring costs related to the mt 
prospect restructuring 
based on the foregoing  during the year ended december   the company recorded non cash pre tax charges and incurred restructuring costs related to its bothell and mt 
prospect businesses as follows year ended december  in s property and equipment impairment goodwill impairment intangible asset impairment restructuring charge see overview section for a more detailed discussion 
property equipment impairment the million property and equipment impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of relates to two impairment analyses performed as a result of certain triggering events 
a million property and equipment impairment charge was recorded due to our mt 
prospect research center facility closure 
during the quarter ended june   we announced the closure of the mt 
prospect facility 
it was determined that the carrying value of the assets was in excess of the fair value of the asset group and we recorded a write down of million 
additionally  a million property and equipment impairment charge was recorded due to an impairment analysis that was performed as a result of the reduction in the carrying value of the library inventories at our bothell research center 
as a result of the impairment analysis  it was determined that the carrying value of the assets was in excess of the fair value of the asset group and we recorded a write down of million 
the revised carrying value of the assets is being depreciated over the average remaining life of the primary assets of the group 
goodwill impairment as a result of the reduction in carrying value of our natural product libraries and related long lived assets at our bothell reporting unit and the announced closure of our mt 
prospect reporting unit  we performed goodwill impairment analyses on each of these reporting units as of june  as a result of these analyses  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge related to our bothell reporting unit and a million impairment charge related to our mt 
prospect reporting unit 
in calculating the goodwill impairment charges  the fair value of the reporting units was determined with assistance from an independent valuation advisor 
the valuations were based upon a discounted cash flow approach 
significant assumptions used in the analysis include i expected future revenue growth rates  reporting unit profit margins  and working capital levels  ii a discount rate  and iii a terminal value multiple 
the revenue growth rates  working capital levels and reporting unit profit margins were based on management s best estimate of future results 
intangible asset impairment as a result of our reduction in the quarter ending june  of the carrying value of our natural product libraries  we also performed an assessment of the carrying value of our microbial cultures and related technologies  which are the starting materials and technology used in the development of the natural product libraries 
based on our assessment  we concluded that the carrying value of the microbial cultures and related technologies was not recoverable  and accordingly recorded an impairment charge of million representing the entire remaining carrying value of microbial cultures and related technologies 
restructuring on may  we announced our plan to consolidate operations by relocating our mt 
prospect facility operations to our facilities in new york 
the company s proprietary biocatalysis technology platform  drug metabolism screening  research fermentation and chemical development technologies in mt 
prospect have been relocated to new york and continue to be fully integrated with the company s drug discovery and development technologies 
the restructuring resulted in the closure of the mt 
prospect research center in the fourth quarter of the consolidation was initiated as a result of a lack of anticipated growth in the company s chemical development services at the facility 
as a result of the restructuring  employees were terminated and employees were relocated to facilities in new york 
the company has accounted for the restructuring costs as required by sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for one time termination benefits that meet certain requirements 
these actions have resulted in the recognition of million of restructuring charges for the year ended december   consisting primarily of employee termination costs and asset disposal costs 
the restructuring costs are included under the caption restructuring charge in the statements of operations and the restructuring liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the balance sheet at december  the following table displays the restructuring activity and liability balances balance at balance at january  charges payments december  in s termination benefits asset disposal costs other associated costs total costs of termination benefits relate to severance packages  outplacement services and career counseling for employees affected by the restructuring 
asset disposal costs relate primarily to brokerage commissions  legal fees  and marketing expenses associated with the planned sale of the mount prospect research center facility  which is included in property and equipment held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company also incurred million in employee and equipment relocation costs during these relocation costs are included under the caption selling  general and administrative in the statement of operations 
we are currently marketing the mt 
prospect research center facility for sale 
the facility qualified for held for sale treatment in accordance with sfas no 
during the fourth quarter 
the long lived assets associated with mt 
prospect have been segregated to a separate line item on the consolidated balance sheet until they are sold and depreciation expense has ceased respective to those assets 
we anticipate the completion of the sale of the facility by june the above restructuring activity was recorded exclusively in the amr operating segment 
the net cash outflow related to the restructuring for the year ended december  was million 
anticipated cash outflows related to the restructuring for are million  which primarily consists of the payment of accrued termination benefits and asset disposal costs 
we anticipate that as a result of this restructuring  we will experience annual expense savings of up to million starting in resulting from a reduction in facility and labor costs 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliates equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliates represents the company s proportionate share in the income or loss of investees that the company accounts for under the equity method 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliates was as follows year ended december  in s the decrease in loss of or to million for the year ended december  from million for is attributed to the company s share of net losses in an equity method investee 
the loss recorded in reduced the value of the company s investment to  and as such  no further adjustments will be recorded until the investee returns to a position of positive net worth 
the decrease in income of million or to million for the year ended december  from million for is attributed to our acquisition of the remaining stock of organichem in  which increased our ownership percentage to at february  from at december   resulting in the full consolidation of organichem s financial results reduced by a minority interest share representing the previous owners share of net income from january  through february  in the loss recorded in represents the company s share of the net loss in a separate equity method investee 
interest expense year ended december  in s interest expense increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase was primarily due to the capitalization of interest costs incurred during the construction of the company s headquarters facility in interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was the result of our new credit facility which we entered into on february  to fund the purchase of organichem s remaining shares 
interest income year ended december  in s interest income decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease is due primarily to a decrease in our rate of return as higher yielding securities matured and were replaced with securities yielding the lower rates reflected in current market conditions 
the company also earned lower rates on its interest bearing cash accounts and other short term cash equivalents in due to the downturn in the interest rate environment 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease was the result of the lower interest rate environment on the company s municipal and government bond portfolio 
loss on equity investment we have equity investments in leveraged private companies that have operations in areas within our strategic focus 
during  we made equity investments in two private companies totaling million 
under the terms of these agreements  we provided fte services to each customer in exchange for equity securities  plus additional fee for service cash payments 
we assess the fair value of these investments quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the investment value may not be recoverable 
during the fourth quarter of  one of our investees attempted to raise additional financing in order to fund its operations  but was unable to secure such financing on acceptable terms 
as such  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our investment based on an analysis of the investee s current financial condition  its prospects of generating additional cash flow from operating activities  the current market conditions for raising capital funding for companies in this industry and the likelihood that any funding raised would significantly dilute our ownership percentage 
as a result of this analysis it was our judgment that an other than temporary impairment had occurred and that the fair value of our investment was zero  resulting in a non cash loss on investment of million 
we determined that no impairment was required for our remaining equity investment based on our analysis as of december  however  should the events and conditions that are indicative of impairment as noted above arise  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
income tax expense year ended december  in s income tax expense decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for income tax expense in reflects the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges as non deductible tax items 
excluding the impact of these items on pre tax income  the decrease in the effective tax rate from is due to the increased impact of permanent tax deductible items in relation to decreased pre tax income in we expect the effective tax rate to approximate of pre tax income for income tax expense decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the effective rate for our provision for income taxes was in compared to in the lower tax rate is attributable to the preferential tax treatment organichem receives for its foreign export sales 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our business through operating cash flows  proceeds from borrowings and the issuance of equity securities 
during  we generated cash of million from operating activities 
the primary sources of operating cash flows are payments received for the performance of contracted chemistry services and royalty payments received from sanofi aventis based upon a percentage of sales of allegra 
the primary uses of operating cash flows are the payment of compensation and benefits to both scientific and administrative personnel  purchases of inventory and supplies  and payment of occupancy costs 
the company s net loss of million includes several significant non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  goodwill impairment charges of million  and impairments of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  and library inventories of million 
these non cash charges are partially offset by the recognition of million of deferred tax benefit  which is a non cash income item 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities  resulting from million for the acquisition of property and equipment  partially offset by proceeds from investment securities of million 
during  we used million for financing activities  consisting of million in long term debt repayments  offset by million provided by stock option and stock purchase plan exercises 
working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase of million resulted primarily from the reclassification of million in property and equipment as held for sale due to the closure of the mt 
prospect research center  an increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments of million due to the collection of receivables a corresponding decrease in working capital of million and reduced capital expenditures in  and a decrease in the current portion of accrued pension benefits payable of million 
partially offsetting these increases in working capital were an increase in taxes payable of million due to the timing of income tax payments and an increase in unearned income of million due to the receipt of funds at the end of for customer projects that will be performed in total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were predominantly in connection with expansion of our manufacturing facilities at organichem 
these expenditures were primarily financed through operating cash flows 
for  we expect to incur million in capital expenditures  primarily related to the continued expansion of organichem manufacturing facilities and the outfitting of leasehold space in singapore in preparation for the commencement of operations at that location 
we entered into a credit facility consisting of million term loan and million line of credit to fund the acquisition of organichem during the term loan matures in february  as of december   the interest rate on million of the outstanding term loan balance was and the interest rate on the remaining million was 
the line of credit expires in february and bears interest at a variable rate based on the company s leverage ratio 
we are currently in discussions with our lenders to extend the term of the line of credit 
as of december   the outstanding balance of the line of credit was million and the interest rate was 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum required operating cash flow coverage ratio  a minimum earnings before interest and taxes to interest ratio and a minimum current ratio 
other covenants include limits on asset disposals and the payment of dividends 
as of december  and we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility 
working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase of million resulted primarily from an increase in inventory of million and accounts receivable of million primarily due to the organichem acquisition  offset by a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments  an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in increase of million in accrued pension costs which represents what we expect to contribute in to our defined benefit pension plans 
total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were predominantly in connection with the expansion of our facilities in albany  new york and at organichem 
these expenditures were primarily financed through operating cash flows 
as of december   we had approximately million in purchase commitments for construction contracts 
during  we generated million from financing activities  consisting primarily of million in borrowings for the acquisition of organichem  offset by million used to purchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase programs and million of debt repayments 
we continue to pursue the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we expect that such activities will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  the issuance of debt or equity securities and borrowings 
future acquisitions  if any  could be funded with cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and or the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition opportunities will be available to us or will be available at prices and upon such other terms that are attractive to us 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and product lines and may hold discussions regarding such potential acquisitions 
as a general rule  we will publicly announce such acquisitions only after a definitive agreement has been signed 
in addition  in order to meet our long term liquidity needs or consummate future acquisitions  we may incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity or debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance our future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our strategy and could negatively affect our operations in future periods 
the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our operating cash flows 
as discussed in item of this form k  several generic manufacturers have filed anda applications with the fda seeking authorization to produce and market a generic version of allegra 
we and aventis pharmaceuticals have filed several patent infringement suits against these generic companies alleging infringement of certain us patents 
should we or aventis be unsuccessful in defending these patents we would experience a material decrease in operating cash flows 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our long term contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands total under year years years after years long term debt principal long term debt interest operating leases purchase commitments pension plan contributions represents estimated interest payments on the company s long term debt based on current interest rates 
related party transactions technology development incentive plan in  we adopted a technology development incentive plan to provide a method to stimulate and encourage novel innovative technology development 
to be eligible to participate  the individual must be an employee and must be the inventor or co inventor of novel technology that results in new revenues received by us 
eligible participants will share in awards based on a percentage of the licensing  royalty or milestone revenue received by us  as defined by the plan 
in  and we awarded technology incentive compensation to the inventor of the terfenadine carboxylic acid metabolite technology  which is covered by the company s patents relating to the active ingredient in allegra 
the inventor is thomas d ambra  our chairman  president and chief executive officer 
the amounts awarded and included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and are million  million and million  respectively 
included in accrued compensation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at both december  and are unpaid technology development incentive compensation awards of and million  respectively 
notes receivable from time to time we make loans to non officer employees in the form of notes receivable 
the notes receivable and accrued interest will not be repaid to us provided the employee remains in our employ throughout the term of the loan 
if employment is terminated prior to the end of the loan term  a pro rata portion of the principal and interest shall be repaid to us 
notes receivable from employees at december  and totaled  and  respectively 
the amounts forgiven and charged to operations in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and are   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  equity investments  unbilled revenue  income taxes  pension and postretirement benefit plans  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
contract revenue recognition our contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers and reimbursed expenses under such contracts 
we also seek to include provisions in certain contracts which contain a combination of up front licensing fees  milestone and royalty payments should our proprietary technology and expertise lead to the discovery of new products that reach the market 
reimbursed expenses consist of chemicals and other project specific costs 
we view contract revenue as our primary measure of revenue growth rather than licensing fees and royalties  which are dependent upon our licensees sales 
generally  our contracts may be terminated by the customer upon days to one year s prior notice  depending on the size of the contract 
we generate contract revenue on the following basis full time equivalent fte 
an fte agreement establishes the number of our employees contracted for a project or a series of projects  the duration of the contract period  the price per fte  plus an allowance for chemicals and other project specific costs  which may or may not be incorporated in the fte rate 
typically  our fte contracts have terms of six months or longer 
our fte contracts typically provide for annual adjustments in billing rates for the scientists assigned to the contract 
these contracts involve our scientists providing services on a best efforts basis in the development of novel chemistry for our customers 
there are no fixed deliverables as part of these services 
as such  we recognize revenue under fte contracts on a monthly basis as services are performed according to the terms of the contract 
time and materials 
under a time and materials contract we charge our customers an hourly rate plus an allowance for chemicals and other project specific costs 
we recognize revenue for time and material contracts based on the number of hours devoted to the project multiplied by the customer s billing rate plus other project specific costs incurred 
fixed fee 
under a fixed fee contract we charge a fixed agreed upon amount for a deliverable 
fixed fee contracts have fixed deliverables upon completion of the project 
we recognize revenue for fixed fee contracts after projects are completed  delivery is made and title transfers to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
up front license fees milestone and royalty revenue 
we analyze our agreements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually or as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and sab  revenue recognition 
allocation of revenue to individual elements which qualify for separate accounting is based on the estimated fair value of the respective elements 
generally  the provisions for licensing  milestone and royalty payments included in our contracts are related to the occurrence of specific identifiable events 
we will recognize revenue from up front non refundable licensing fees over the period we have continuing involvement in the underlying project 
we will recognize revenue arising from a milestone payment upon the successful achievement of the event  and the resolution of any uncertainties or contingencies regarding potential collection of the related payment  or if appropriate over the remaining term of the agreement 
deferred revenue 
deferred revenue represents monies received for services that have not yet been performed as well as customer billings related to completed production which has not yet shipped 
as an added service  during we began to temporarily store completed cgmp production at our facilities for certain customers 
under these arrangements  upon completion of the customer project we typically will enter into a storage agreement with the customer 
we will temporarily store and subsequently ship the completed production  often in multiple shipments to multiple sites 
the revenue related to these arrangements is recognized at the time the products are ultimately shipped 
recurring royalty revenue recognition 
recurring royalties consist of royalties under a license agreement with sanofi aventis based on the worldwide sales of fexofenadine hcl  marketed as allegra in the americas and telfast elsewhere 
we record royalty revenue in the period in which the sales of allegra occur 
royalty payments from sanofi aventis are due within days after each calendar quarter and are determined based on sales of allegra telfast in that quarter 
restructuring charges the company accounts for its restructuring costs as required by sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for one time termination benefits that meet certain requirements 
inventory inventory consists primarily of commercially available fine chemicals used as raw materials in the research and production process  work in process and finished goods at our organichem location and chemical compounds in the form of natural product and novel compound collections 
we capitalize the costs associated with the production of our novel compound collections 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market 
we record reserves for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  which could result in a charge to operations 
initial costs to develop novel compound libraries are categorized as research and development expense until such time it becomes probable that a saleable library can be successfully produced 
as a result  costs for the design  research  and testing of libraries under development are expensed as incurred 
our research chemists review the results of analytical procedures to determine if the chemical reactions were completed as expected and the product purity and product yields are within required specifications 
this validation process determines whether the chemistry is successful and if a saleable product will result 
we capitalize costs of production to inventory once the validation process is completed and successful production is reasonably assured 
if a core reaction is unsuccessful  the library template is abandoned and no further development takes place 
capitalized costs are amortized over the economic life of the library estimated at years at the greater of a the ratio of the product s current gross revenue to the total of current and expected gross revenues or b the straight line method computed by dividing the remaining unamortized capitalized cost by the remaining economic life of the product 
the remaining economic life is reassessed at each balance sheet date and changes in estimate  if appropriate  are made to the amortization model 
amortization of library inventories is included within research and development expense on the consolidated income statement 
in addition  the company monitors the carrying value of its natural product and lead finding sample collections for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the company compares the carrying values of these collections to their estimated net realizable fair values  which are based on estimated future sales of these collections  to determine impairment 
the company recognizes an impairment charge for any collection whose carrying value is greater than its estimated net realizable fair value 
if we are unable to meet forecasted revenues related to those assets or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of all or a portion of the remaining value of compound library assets totaling million at december  may be required  resulting in a charge to operations 
goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas  the company performs an annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill for potential impairment or on an interim basis if certain triggering events occur 
a determination of impairment is made based upon the estimated discounted future cash flows of the operations associated with the related reporting unit 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired in the future the company would be required to record a charge to its results of operations 
factors the company considers important which could result in an impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
if management s expectations of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units could change significantly 
such a change could result in additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
total goodwill recorded on the company s balance sheet at december  was million  including million of goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of organichem  inc long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas  the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include  among others  the following a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  a significant change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  and a significant decrease in the market value of assets 
if the company determines that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company compares the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows an impairment charge is recorded 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds their fair value and will reduce only the carrying amounts of the long lived assets 
equity investments we have equity investments in leveraged private companies that have operations in areas within our strategic focus 
we account for these investments using the cost method of accounting for investments as our ownership interest in each customer is below and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entities 
we assess the fair value of these investments quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstance  such as changes in market conditions  poor operating results of the underlying investments  or the inability of the entities to obtain additional financing indicate that the investment value may not be recoverable 
however  should the events and conditions that are indicative of impairment as noted above arise  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
total equity investments recorded on the company s balance sheet at december  were million 
pension and postretirement benefit plans we maintain pension and postretirement costs and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  and trends in health care costs  which are updated on an annual basis 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in the related pension benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to absorb estimated receivable losses as circumstances arise that bring into doubt our ability to fully collect on outstanding receivable balances 
the allowance and related accounts receivable are reduced when the account is deemed uncollectible 
environmental costs in the ordinary course of business the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations  and has made provisions for the estimated financial impact of environmental cleanup related costs 
the quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors  including changing laws and regulations  advancements in environmental technologies  the quality of information available related to specific sites  the assessment stage of each site investigation  preliminary findings and the length of time involved in the remediation or settlement 
the company accrues environmental cleanup related costs when those costs are believed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated 
stock based compensation the company applies the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for its fixed plan stock options 
as such  compensation expense would be recorded only if  on the date of grant  the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price 
any compensation expense would be recognized over the vesting period 
the company discloses the pro forma compensation cost for stock option grants in accordance with sfas no 
pro forma compensation cost is based on the fair value of the options on their grant date  and is recognized over the period of requisite service 
the fair value of stock option grants is determined utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including expected volatility in the company s common share price  risk free interest rates  and the expected lives of the options granted  and are updated for each option grant 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including interest rates and the market for the company s common stock  as well as historical data regarding option exercises and forfeitures in making these assumptions 
changes in the related compensation costs associated with future grants may occur due to changes in the assumptions 
the company expects to adopt sfas no 
revised  share based payment  in the third quarter of sfas no 
r will require the recognition of compensation expense associated with share based payment in the company s consolidated income statement  and is expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the taxable income in the two previous tax years to which tax loss carryback can be applied 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  taxable income in the carryback period and tax planning strategies in making this assessment  and records a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when considered necessary

risk factors and certain factors affecting forward looking statements the following factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information in this form k 
except as mentioned under quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion contained in this form k contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this form k 
important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may discontinue or decrease their usage of our services 
we depend on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that use our services for a large portion of our revenues 
although there has been a trend among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource drug research and development functions  this trend may not continue 
we have experienced increasing pressure on the part of our customers to reduce expenses  including the use of our services as a result of negative economic trends generally and in the pharmaceutical industry 
our contract revenues declined in and we may continue to be adversely effected should economic conditions worsen 
if pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies discontinue or decrease their usage of our services  including as a result of a slowdown in the overall united states economy  our revenues and earnings could be lower than we expect and our revenues may decrease or not grow at historical rates 
we may lose one or more of our major customers 
during the year ended december   revenues from ge biosciences totaled million and represented approximately of our contract revenue  or of our total revenue 
organichem entered into a long term supply agreement with ge biosciences in under which ge biosciences purchases from us begin to expire in and terminate at the end of ge biosciences is expected to discontinue purchases of one of the products that we sell to them by the third quarter of sales of this product totaled million  which represents of organichem s revenue and of total contract revenue for the year ended december  we expect ge biosciences remaining purchases of this product to all occur in the first half of and to decrease by from levels  with no revenues associated with this product after additionally  ge biosciences purchases have historically exceeded the contractual minimum purchases  however  this may not continue 
if ge biosciences materially reduces its historical purchase levels or we can not renew or replace the revenue from this contract or the revenue from the discontinued product  there may be a material decrease in our revenues and operating income 
in addition  during the year ended december   our amr segment provided services to three major customers represents approximately of our contract revenues or of our total revenue 
these customers typically may cancel their contracts with days to one year s prior notice depending on the size of the contract  for a variety of reasons  many of which are beyond our control 
if any one of our major customers cancels its contract with us  our contract revenues may decrease 
the royalties we earn on allegra may decrease 
we have been issued several patents on a pure form of  and a manufacturing process for  fexofenadine hcl 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical  medical and biotechnology firms can be uncertain and can involve complex legal and factual questions 
litigation  in particular patent litigation  can be complex and time consuming and the outcome is inherently uncertain 
we cannot assure investors that sanofi aventis will ultimately succeed in its current or any future litigation against generic drug manufacturers involving patents with respect to allegra 
in the event that one or more of the patents owned by us or sanofi aventis are ultimately determined to be invalid or unenforceable  sanofi aventis and we would lose exclusivity with respect to the claims covered by those patents 
any such loss of exclusivity and the contemporaneous introduction of generic forms of fexofenadine hcl may cause a reduction in allegra sales 
in addition  under our current arrangements with sanofi aventis  sanofi aventis  with consultation from us  will take the lead with respect to preparing and executing a strategy to defend and enforce certain of the patents relating to allegra  and is executing that role in the current litigation 
as a result  we may not be able to control the conduct of such litigation and the strategic decisions that are made during the course of such litigation 
see item legal proceedings 
on may   an fda advisory panel recommended that the prescription allergy drugs claritin  allegra and zyrtec are safe enough to be made available over the counter 
the panel had been assembled as a result of a petition by blue cross of california now wellpoint health networks requesting that the three top selling prescription antihistamines be changed to otc status 
the fda panel s only consideration was whether claritin  allegra and zyrtec have the safety profile for over the counter use without a learned intermediary 
the panel s recommendation remains under consideration by the full fda 
the fda s reaction to its advisory panel s recommendation with regard to the safety of allegra is uncertain 
in november  schering plough received approval by the fda to voluntarily switch the status of claritin from prescription to otc status 
in december  schering plough began to market and sell claritin as an otc drug 
royalties from sales of allegra currently constitute a significant portion of our total revenues and operating income 
during the year ended december   our royalties from allegra were million  which represented approximately of our total revenues 
for the year ended december   our royalties from allegra were million  which represented approximately of our total revenues 
the marketing of otc claritin and subsequent private label antihistamine otc products in the us has adversely affected allegra s reimbursement status by third party payers resulting in a decline in sales growth in the us during further claritin otc competition  the potential for generic allegra competition and the possibility that the fda requires allegra or zyrtec to be sold in an over the counter form  may further adversely affect allegra s reimbursement status by third party payers and the price at which it can be sold 
any such price reduction may not be adequately offset by increased volume of sales 
if the dollar amount of allegra sales subject to our license agreement decreases  due to these or any other factors  our revenues from our license agreement with sanofi aventis will also decrease 
because we have very few costs associated with the allegra license  a decrease in revenues from our license agreement for allegra would have a material effect on our revenue and operating income 
for example  a million decrease in our allegra royalty revenue would decrease our operating income by million 
we face increased competition 
we compete directly with the in house research departments of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies  as well as combinatorial chemistry companies  contract research companies  and research and academic institutions 
we are also experiencing increased competition from foreign companies operating under lower cost structures 
many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have 
as new companies enter the market and as more advanced technologies become available  we expect to face increased competition 
in the future  any one of our competitors may develop technological advances that render the services that we provide obsolete 
while we plan to develop technologies  which will give us competitive advantages  our competitors plan to do the same 
we may not be able to develop the technologies we need to successfully compete in the future  and our competitors may be able to develop such technologies before we do or provide those services at a lower cost 
consequently  we may not be able to successfully compete in the future 
we may be unsuccessful in producing and licensing proprietary technology developed from our internal research and development efforts or acquired from a third party 
we have expended and continue to expend time and money on internal research and development with the intention of producing proprietary technologies in order to patent and then license them to other companies 
however  we may not be successful in producing any valuable technology or successful in licensing it to a third party 
to the extent we are unable to produce technology that we can license  we may not receive any revenues related to our internal research and development efforts 
we may be unsuccessful in selling or licensing the chemical and natural product collections currently in our inventory 
as of december  the total cost of our chemical and natural product libraries included in our inventory is million 
although we write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory  if we are not able to execute our business plan within certain prescribed timeframes  or if actual market conditions are less favorable than we project  additional inventory write downs may be required in the future 
for example  during we recorded a impairment charge related to our chemical and natural product library collections 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this impairment charge 
our goodwill may become impaired 
as of december   we have million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet 
we perform an annual assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill for potential impairment through an independent third party 
a determination of impairment is made based upon the estimated future cash flows of the operations associated with goodwill 
an independent third party impairment review was completed in and determined that no impairment was required 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired in the future we would be required to record a charge to our results of operations 
for example  during we recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling million 
factors we consider important which could result in an impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impairment charge 
we may lose valuable intellectual property if we are unable to protect it 
some of our most valuable assets include patents and trade secrets 
part of our business is developing technologies that we patent and then license to other companies 
however  some technologies that we develop may already be patented by other companies 
for this and other reasons  we may not be able to obtain patents for each new technology that we develop 
even if we are able to obtain patents  the patents may not sufficiently protect our interest in the technology 
similarly  we may not be able to protect our trade secrets by keeping them confidential 
additionally  protecting our patents and trade secrets may be costly and time consuming 
to the extent we are unable to protect intellectual property  our investment in those technologies may not yield the benefits we expected 
in addition  we may be subject to claims that we are infringing on the intellectual property of others 
we could incur significant costs defending such claims 
if we are unsuccessful in defending these claims  we may be subject to liability for infringement 
our failure to manage our expansion may adversely affect us 
our business has expanded rapidly in the past several years 
expansion places increased stress on our financial  managerial and human resources 
as we expand  we will need to recruit and retain additional highly skilled scientists and technicians 
expansion of our facilities may lead to increased expenses and may divert management attention away from operations 
future acquisitions may disrupt our business and distract our management 
we have engaged in a number of acquisitions and strategic investments  and we expect to continue to do so 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates  and if we do identify suitable candidates  we may not be able to make such acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we acquire another company  we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired business into our existing business in a timely and non disruptive manner or at all 
we may have to devote a significant amount of time and resources to do so 
even with this investment of time and resources  an acquisition may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipate 
if we fail to integrate the acquired business effectively or if key employees of that business leave  the anticipated benefits of the acquisition would be jeopardized 
the time  capital  management and other resources spent on an acquisition that fails to meet our expectations could cause our business and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  acquisitions can involve non recurring charges of significant amounts of goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not be able to realize the benefits of recent acquisitions and strategic investments 
we acquired enzymed  inc  a provider of combinatorial biocatalysis discovery services  in october  american advanced organics  inc  a contract manufacturer of novel compounds  pharmaceutical intermediates and test drug substances  in february  new chemical entities  a chemistry based drug discovery company  in january  and great lakes chemical company s research and development facility outside of chicago  illinois in september we made a strategic investment in organichem corporation in december to facilitate a management buyout of a chemical manufacturing facility from nycomed amersham  plc and completed the full acquisition of organichem in february these transactions may not be as beneficial to us as we expect 
we also have an investment in fluorous technologies  inc fluorous technologies is a development stage company and may not be able to successfully develop technology and products 
during  we made additional equity investments in two private companies 
under the terms of these agreements  we also provided fte services to each company in exchange for equity securities and fee for service cash payments 
both of these companies are currently in the process of raising additional financing 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results of underlying investments or the investees inability to obtain additional financing could result in our inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby requiring an impairment charge in the future 
for example  during the fourth quarter of we recorded a million impairment charge related to an investment we made in a drug discovery company 
we may not be able to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees we need 
our future growth and profitability depends upon the research and efforts of our highly skilled employees  such as our scientists  and their ability to keep pace with changes in drug discovery and development technologies 
we believe that there is a shortage of scientists  and we compete vigorously with pharmaceutical firms  biotechnology firms  contract research firms  and academic and research institutions to recruit scientists 
if we cannot recruit and retain scientists and other highly skilled employees  we will not be able to continue our existing services and will not be able to expand the services we offer to our customers 
we may lose one or more of our key employees 
our business is highly dependent on our senior management and scientific staff  including dr 
thomas e 
d ambra  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  mark t 
frost  our chief financial officer  secretary and treasurer  james j 
grates  our vice president  operations eric smart  our vice president  business development dr 
michael p 
trova  our senior vice president  chemistry  dr 
bruce j 
sargent  our vice president  discovery research and development  kenton shultis  our vice president and general manager  organichem  dr 
harold meckler  our vice president  science technology  and  patricia ellis  our vice president  quality and analytical services  although we have employment agreements with the individuals listed above  we do not have employment agreements with all of our key employees 
additionally  the loss of any of our other key employees  including our scientists  may have an adverse effect on our business 
the royalties we earn on allegra will likely be affected by the seasonal nature of allergies 
allergic reactions to plants  pollens and other airborne allergens generally occur during the spring and summer seasons 
therefore  we expect the demand for allegra to be lower during other times of the year 
because allegra sales change seasonally based on the demand for allergy medicines  our quarter to quarter revenues will likely experience fluctuations 
we may be held liable for harm caused by drugs that we develop and test 
we develop  test and  to a limited extent  manufacture drugs that are used by humans 
if any of the drugs that we develop  test or manufacture harms people  we may be required to pay damages to those persons 
although we carry liability insurance  we may be required to pay damages in excess of the amounts of our insurance coverage 
damages awarded in a product liability action could be substantial and could have a negative impact on our financial condition 
we may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials that we use 
our research and development processes involve the use of hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulation governing the use  manufacture  handling  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials and we may incur liability as a result of any contamination or injury 
we may also incur expenses relating to compliance with environmental laws 
such expenses or liabilities could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition 
organichem has completed an environmental remediation associated with groundwater contamination at its rensselaer  new york location 
this contamination is associated with past practices at the facility prior to  and prior to amri s investment or ownership of the facility 
ongoing costs associated with the remediation include biannual monitoring and reporting to the state of new york s department of environmental conservation 
under the remediation plan  organichem is expected to pay for monitoring and reporting until under a agreement with the facility s previous owner  organichem s maximum liability under the remediation is million 
if the state of new york department of environmental conservation finds that we fail to comply with the appropriate regulatory standards  it may impose fines on us which could have a negative impact on our operations 
additionally  if we are unable to enforce our contractual maximum remediation liability of million  it may have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
if we fail to meet strict regulatory requirements  we could be required to pay fines or even close our facilities 
all facilities and manufacturing techniques used to manufacture drugs in the united states must conform to standards that are established by the federal food and drug administration  or fda 
the fda conducts scheduled periodic inspections of our facilities to monitor our compliance with regulatory standards 
if the fda finds that we fail to comply with the appropriate regulatory standards  it may impose fines on us or  if the fda determines that our non compliance is severe  it may close our facilities 
any adverse action by the fda would have a negative impact on our operations 
our operations may be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event at our primary facilities 
we depend on our laboratories and equipment for the continued operation of our business 
our research and development operations and all administrative functions are primarily conducted at our facilities in albany and rensselaer  new york 
although we have contingency plans in effect for natural disasters or other catastrophic events  catastrophic events could still disrupt our operations 
even though we carry business interruption insurance policies  we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies 
any natural disaster or catastrophic event in the albany area or in our facilities could have a significant negative impact on our operations 
terrorist attacks or acts of war may seriously harm our business 
terrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our company  our employees  our facilities and our customers  which could significantly impact our revenues  costs and expenses and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the long term effects on our company of the september  attacks are unknown 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war  including the current war in iraq  or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 
health care reform could reduce the prices pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for drugs they sell which  in turn  could reduce the amounts that they have available to retain our services 
we depend on contracts with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a majority of our revenues 
we therefore depend upon the ability of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to earn enough profit on the drugs they market to devote substantial resources to the research and development of new drugs 
future legislation may limit the prices pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for the drugs they market 
such laws may have the effect of reducing the resources that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can devote to the research and development of new drugs 
if pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies decrease the resources they devote to the research and development of new drugs  the amount of services that we perform  and therefore our revenues  could be reduced 
the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited  which may not be in your best interests 
there are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us  even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests 
these provisions include the following our certificate of incorporation provides for three classes of directors with the term of office of one class expiring each year  commonly referred to as a staggered board 
by preventing stockholders from voting on the election of more than one class of directors at any annual meeting of stockholders  this provision may have the effect of keeping the current members of our board of directors in control for a longer period of time than stockholders may desire 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred stock issued  which would allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or change in control 
additionally  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which  in general  imposes restrictions upon acquirers of or more of our stock 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan  the purpose of which is  among other things  to enhance the board s ability to protect shareholder interests and to ensure that shareholders receive fair treatment in the event any coercive takeover attempt of us is made in the future 
under the terms of the shareholder rights plan  the board can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
once a shareholder acquires more than of our outstanding common stock without board approval the acquiring person  all other shareholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price less than their then fair market value 
these subsequent purchases by other shareholders substantially reduce the value and influence of the shares of common stock owned by the acquiring person 
our officers and directors will have significant control over us and their interests may differ from yours 
at february   our directors and officers beneficially owned or controlled approximately of our common stock 
individually and in the aggregate  these stockholders significantly influence our management  affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval 
in particular  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing an acquisition of us and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
because our stock price may be volatile  our stock price could experience substantial declines 
the market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience volatility 
our quarterly operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
in addition  during the past twelve months  the stock market  and in particular technology companies  have experienced significant decreases in market value 
in addition  the global economic and potential uncertainty  including as a result of the war in iraq and the international controversy that accompanied it  have created significant additional volatility in the united states capital markets 
this volatility and the recent market decline has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies  often for reasons unrelated to their operating performance or their business prospects  and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
because we do not intend to pay dividends  you will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain our future earnings  if any  to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the success of your investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation 
there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased your shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market risk with respect to interest rates 
the risk is composed of changes in future cash flows due to changes in interest rates on our variable rate million term loan  million line of credit  and our million industrial development authority bonds 
to mitigate this risk  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements that have fixed the interest rate on of our debt 
included in other assets is  which represents the estimated increase in market value since entering into the swap agreements 
the potential loss in future cash flows from a adverse change in quoted interest rates would approximate
