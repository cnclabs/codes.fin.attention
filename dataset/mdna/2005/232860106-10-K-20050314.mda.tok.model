item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this overview is intended to provide a context for the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included in this annual report 
we have attempted to identify the most important matters on which our management focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and the short term and long term opportunities  challenges and risks including material trends and uncertainties which we face 
we also discuss the actions we are taking to address these opportunities  challenges and risks 
the overview is not intended as a summary of  or a substitute for review of  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
for comparative purposes  certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the reclassifications had no impact on net income 
monetary amounts presented in the following discussion are in thousands  except per share amounts 
business segments we operate as a rural local telephone company providing integrated communications services to residential and business customers in markets throughout the eastern half of pennsylvania 
we operate an incumbent rural local exchange carrier  or rlec  in parts of berks  lancaster  union and smaller portions of five other adjacent counties in pennsylvania  and a competitive local telephone company  or clec  in the lancaster  harrisburg  reading  altoona  pottstown  state college and williamsport  pennsylvania metropolitan areas  which we refer to as our edge out markets 
we offer our customers a comprehensive package of communications services including local and long distance telephone services  high speed data  internet access and video services 
we also provide business customers with integrated voice and data network solutions 
our segments  excluding our d e wireless and paging services  which are reported as discontinued segments  are rlec  clec  internet services  systems integration and conestoga wireless until the sale of its assets in january the measure of profitability for our segments is operating income loss since individual segment managers are not responsible for such items as interest and taxes that are reported below operating income loss 
as of december   we served  rlec access lines   clec access lines   dial up internet access subscribers   dsl and web hosting customers 
for the year ended december   we generated total revenues of  and operating income of  historically  we have derived a majority of our revenues from the regulated rlec segments 
the rlec segment accounts for approximately of total revenues and substantially all of our operating income 
our rlec revenue is derived primarily from network access charges  local telephone service  enhanced telephone services and regional toll service 
our clec revenue is derived primarily from network access charges  local telephone service  enhanced telephone services and long distance service revenue 
our internet services revenue is derived from dial up and high speed internet access services  in addition to web hosting services 
our systems integration revenue is derived from sales of solutions that support the design  implementation and maintenance of local and wide area networks and telecommunications systems 
our operating costs and expenses primarily include wages and related employee benefit costs  depreciation and amortization  selling and advertising  software and information system services and general and administrative expenses 
our rlec segment incurs costs related to network access charges  directory expense  and other operations expenses such as digital electronic switch expense  engineering and testing costs 
our clec incurs costs related to leased network facilities associated with providing local telephone service to customers  engineering costs  and network access costs for local calls and long distance expense 
our internet services segment incurs leased network facilities costs for our dial up internet service and for our dsl broadband 
table of contents data service 
our systems integration business incurs expenses primarily related to wages and employee benefit costs  and equipment and materials used in the course of the installation and provision of our products and services 
we incur access line related capital expenditures associated with access line additions  expenditures for upgrading existing facilities and costs related to the provision of dsl and dial up internet services in our rlec and clec territories 
we believe that our capital expenditures related to clec access line growth are generally associated with serving additional customers or servicing existing customers on our own facilities and therefore tend to result in incremental revenue or higher margins 
we believe that our additional capital expenditures relating to our investment in software and systems will provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace and generally allow for corresponding reductions in operating expenses 
business strategy our primary business objective is to be a leading  regional broadband icp 
to achieve this objective  we will continue to pursue the following goals we will continue to operate under a disciplined strategy to increase our market share in our edge out markets by offering competitive communication service packages primarily to business customers 
we will continue to leverage our modern network infrastructure  established reputation  extensive local knowledge and significant operating experience to attempt to gain new customers and increase our market share in our edge out markets 
we will deliver multiple communication services such as high speed data  voip and video over copper and fiber networks to meet bandwidth intensive demands of our residential and business customers 
we will continue to build out our fiber to the node infrastructure to support the future deployment of advanced ip communication services 
we will endeavor to be a single source provider of voice and data communications services to our business customers 
we believe that the convergence and complexity of voice communications and data network technologies has increased the need for businesses to seek a single provider for all of their communications and data networking needs 
our systems integration business enhances our service through its managed service offerings  and we believe bundling of video  high speed data and voice is a key part of the strategy to grow revenue and strengthen customer relationships while providing increased value 
we will make efforts to further expand our market share of the broadband and internet services market by meeting or exceeding the customer service and technical requirements of individual and business customers 
we intend to minimize our dial up internet access customer base churn  but recognize as we migrate more customers on to our broadband service we help create that churn 
we will offer a broad array of enhanced voice and data communication services to our customers that improve our general customer experience  thereby helping to retain customers 
we will continue to make our commitment to customer service a top priority 
our noc provides repair and emergency services hours a day  days a week and days a year  which strengthens our relationships with our customers and enhances our competitive position 
we will consider increasing the scale and scope of our business through acquisitions of companies  including other rlecs that strategically fit with our integrated communications strategy 
acquisition targets may include companies that deepen our industry focus  broaden service territories and increase the breadth of our services 
business risks our primary business risks include the external threat of increased competition in the telecommunications industry and the internal risk of our debt financing  which was primarily incurred in connection with the acquisition of conestoga in 
table of contents risk of increased competition it is basic policy of the fcc and the pennsylvania public utility commission to encourage competition in the communications industry 
the limited suspension that we held until january from certain interconnection requirements of ta has been discontinued  although recently enacted legislation in pennsylvania in the fourth quarter of provided the limited suspension to our buffalo valley rlec through december  these developments mean that two of our rlecs could be required to allow competitors to have access to our customers by our competitors seeking the removal of our rural exemption  entering our territory and using our services and facilities through interconnection agreements to provide local services 
the convergence of voice and data communication technologies is dramatically changing the communications industry 
for several years  telephone and cable companies have been able to provide data transmission  with telephone companies having the advantage in voice and cable companies having the advantage in video 
technology may be eliminating those advantages 
the further development of voip is changing voice communication to a packet data transmission process  which will place the cable companies in a competitive situation with the telephone companies 
furthermore  there is not consistent regulation of voip offerings at this time  placing voip at a possible regulatory advantage over telephone services 
to maintain our voice business  we plan to offer voip over our system 
we are now able to offer video over a portion of our fiber copper system that is capable of competing with the video services offered by the cable companies 
to make the competitive picture even more complex  wireless offerings in voice and data are becoming more capable and competitive  and it appears that technology has been developed that will enable electric power transmission lines to compete effectively in the communications industry 
in the future  service offerings of telephone  cable and electric power lines in voice  data and video may be similar  and wireless is certainly a significant provider in voice and data 
all of this will result in a highly competitive environment in which four types of companies are very likely to be in direct competition with each other in many locations 
this development could cause the telephone companies to lose their competitive edge in their territories and could result in significant inroads into their business 
the competitive threat posed by the convergence of technologies makes our commitment to customer service even more critical to the protection of our competitive position 
we are a local company with local connections that can give individual  personalized service 
we are also small enough to be able to provide an individual response to customer services needs 
we feel that this responsiveness will be critical to our future well being 
it may be a challenge to successfully convince both our business and residential customers to see us as their preferred provider of integrated communications services  particularly in light of the substantially greater resources of many of our competitors 
the foregoing opportunities and risks require management to attempt to balance several aspects of our business 
our relatively stable rlec business segment provides cash flow both to pursue our business plan to be a leading  regional broadband icp and to provide a current return on investment to our shareholders in the form of our regular dividend 
however  since our resources are limited and the manner in which the communications industry will develop is uncertain  both in terms of technology and competition  we will not be able to pursue every possible avenue of development  and critical decisions will need to be made at various stages of our evolution as a company 
these decisions can be made more difficult by our desire to balance our short term goals of maintaining our rlec business segment and dividend return and our long term goal of providing voice  data and video services 
maintaining our dividend payout may be challenging due to the need to invest in our future and restrictions under our financing facilities  both in the form of an annual limitation of  in dividends and the requirement to remain in compliance with financial covenants 
risk of debt financing we refinanced our indebtedness in march and further amended it in november the effect of the refinancing was to lower the interest rates on our indebtedness  provide greater flexibility in our 
table of contents financial covenants and spread out the amortization of principal 
the refinancing also lifts restrictions on the expansion of our clec edge out market and eliminates the requirement of the prior loan agreement that excess cash flow be applied to prepayments of principal 
this new structure  pursued to manage our balance sheet in order to better pursue our business plan  decreases the risks associated with our indebtedness 
however  our indebtedness of approximately  as of december  could restrict our operations because we will use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
the level of indebtedness will make us more vulnerable to economic or industry down turns  and our debt service obligations increase our vulnerability to competitive pressures  as we may be more leveraged than many of our competitors 
results of operations the measure of segment results used by management is operating income loss 
in  d e moved responsibility for some products to different segment managers 
certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation

table of contents consolidated operations overview of compared to consolidated operating revenues from continuing operations in increased  or  to  in from  in the revenue increase was primarily due to the growth in dsl internet services and an increased number of clec customers during changes in how we are compensated by certain wireless carriers to use our rlec network  have reduced revenues by a net of  in spite of an increase in total switched cellular minutes 
the corporate  other revenues change includes an increase for video operations and a decrease in revenues due to the sale of conestoga wireless in january  which resulted in decreased revenue of consolidated operating income from continuing operations for  decreased  to  in from  in the decreased operating income in was partially attributable to approximately of increased employee medical benefit expenses  approximately for compliance with sarbanes oxley regulations and over of increased operating losses associated with the video services since its expansion into the buffalo valley market in mid income loss from continuing operations decreased  to a loss of  in from an income of  in partially due to the decrease in operating income discussed above  net of taxes 
other factors related to the decline were the loss on early extinguishment of debt of  related to the debt refinancing in march and the amendment in november  which was only partially offset by an interest expense reduction of  in  the equity in loss of affiliates includes  for our share of an impairment of assets at pilicka and an impairment of our investment in eurotel 
also  in  there was a realized gain on the disposition of investments available for sale 
overview of compared to consolidated operating revenues from continuing operations in  increased  or  to  in from  in the revenue increase was primarily due to the inclusion of  of conestoga s revenues for the full twelve months in  compared to only  for seven months in  after the may  acquisition 
conestoga revenues declined in by  from revenues in due to the sale of conestoga wireless in january consolidated operating income from continuing operations for  increased  to  in from  in the increased operating income in was primarily attributable to conestoga s  contribution to income for twelve months rather than  for the seven months in further  in  we did not incur the same of expense due to the merger related costs experienced in d e and conestoga also benefited from the reduction of expenses primarily related to staff reductions at the date of the merger and over the following six months 
income from continuing operations increased  to income of  in from a loss of  in primarily due to the increase in operating income discussed above  net of taxes 
also  in  there was an increase of  in realized gains losses on the disposition of investments available for sale  a reduction in expenses from reduced equity losses in affiliates  and other miscellaneous income increases 
this reduction was offset by the  increase in interest expense related to larger borrowings for the full twelve months

access revenues decreased due to a revision to our national exchange carrier association neca settlements estimate  the effect of increased wireless minutes of use resulting in approximately additional revenue  and a new reciprocal compensation agreement with a wireless carrier which decreased revenue approximately  other revenue decreased as a result of long distance  premise hardware and services decreasing  more than offsetting the increase in directory revenue

d e telephone other revenue decreased in compared to primarily from a decrease in long distance revenues 
local telephone revenues are anticipated to increase as the result of sales of local dedicated circuits offsetting the effect of continued line count erosion 
network access revenues are likely to decrease slightly due to a decline in minutes of use and a reduction in state access rates as regulatory trends move toward transferring cost to the local telephone end user 
other revenues  which include enhanced services  directory advertising and other miscellaneous services are likely to continue the trend of moderate increases  while we expect decreased long distance service revenues 
rlec segment operating expenses increased  or  to  in and  or  to  in in  directory expense increased in line with directory revenues 
operating expenses increased due to the cost of complying with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act relating to internal controls over financial reporting which was primarily allocated to the rlec segment 
the increase was primarily attributable to including twelve months in of conestoga operating expenses and seven months since the acquisition in operating income decreased  or in to  and increased  or  in to  the synergies resulting from the conestoga acquisition  including staff reductions and other cost savings contributed to the improved profitability in

in  the conestoga acquisition added  of revenue  versus  of revenue from the seven months since the acquisition in increases in revenue due to the conestoga acquisition were offset by decreases in d e revenues of  in the decreases were primarily of communication services and  of product sales 
we believe these decreases partially related to the effects of a slow economy  increased competition and reductions in customer spending for communications related infrastructure and consulting services 
operating expenses increased  or  to  in and  or  to  in labor and benefits accounted for more than of the expense increase 
the expenses increased as a result of a full year of expenses from the conestoga operations acquired in may  selling expense increases and increased expenses relating to integration of software systems 
operating losses increased to  in and  to  in conestoga wireless segment results amounts for all years for conestoga wireless are combined with the  corporate and other amounts and include no revenue in but of operating income was recorded principally from prior years tax settlements in the current year 
other income expense other income expense for was an expense of  compared to an expense of  in the primary reasons for this  change are as follows our equity in net loss of affiliates increased to a loss of  in from  in the increased loss resulted from  for our share of an impairment of assets in pilicka offset by improved results of pilicka s telephone operations and lower eurotel legal expenses 
since we and 
table of contents eurotel have no legal obligation nor intention to provide future funding to pilicka  we each have written our investment in pilicka to zero and will discontinue recognizing our equity share of pilicka s ongoing losses 
eurotel no longer records any value to its investment in pilicka and therefore the value of our investment in eurotel was written down as an other than temporary loss on investments of  we have also committed to fund eurotel  on an equal basis with the other investors in eurotel  certain of its operating cash needs and will continue to recognize our equity share of their ongoing losses 
our interest expense decreased  in to  primarily as a result of refinancing our syndicated senior secured credit facilities in march and amending the pricing of the term loan b in november as well as the beginning of scheduled principal repayments during in  we recognized a gain of related to the sale of available for sale investments for which there was no similar gain in in  we incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt of  in regard to refinancing and amending our credit facility 
there was no similar expense in other  net decreased principally due to a reduction in a patronage dividend received as a borrower from a cooperative bank offset by increased interest income and initial principal payment collected on the note receivable from the sale of conestoga wireless 
other income expense for was an expense of  compared to an expense of  in the primary reasons for this change are as follows our equity in net loss of affiliates decreased to a loss of  in from  in the change was primarily from improved results of pilicka s telephone operations and lower eurotel legal expenses 
our interest expense increased  in to  primarily as a result of the borrowing to complete the conestoga acquisition being outstanding for the full year

income taxes federal and state income taxes were an expense of  in on the  loss from continuing operations and a tax expense of  on the  income from continuing operations in the tax expense reflects tax on income in the united states while the pilicka asset impairment and the impairment of our investment in eurotel created a deferred tax deduction that may not be realizable

effects of inflation it is the opinion of management that the effects of inflation on operating expenses over the past three years have been immaterial and have been partially offset by growth in operating and other revenues 
management anticipates that this trend will continue with a greater upward pressure on costs in financial condition liquidity and capital resources we have historically generated significant cash from our operating activities 
our overall capital resource strategy is to finance capital expenditures for new and existing lines of businesses and acquisitions partly with operating cash and through external sources  such as bank borrowings and offerings of debt or equity securities 
net cash provided by continuing operations was  in cash provided by continuing operations has increased from  in and  in in  the increase was primarily attributable to a reduction of accounts receivable 
in  the increase is partially related to the five additional months of conestoga operations included compared to the seven months included in after the acquisition 
improved operating results relating to the operating efficiencies of the combined company have contributed to improved cash generated by continuing operating activities 
heightened competition in the telecommunications industry could affect future cash flows related to continuing operations

on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets  income taxes  revenues  contingencies and impairment of long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  as further described below 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of all significant accounting policies that we follow in the preparation of our financial statements 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies as those that are the most significant to our financial statement presentation and that require difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition revenue for all of our business segments is recorded when services are provided or products are delivered  when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our rlec and clec pricing is subject to oversight by both state and federal regulatory commissions 

table of contents such regulation also covers services  competition and other public policy issues 
different interpretations by regulatory bodies may result in adjustments in future periods to revenues derived from our rlec and clec operations 
we monitor these proceedings closely and make adjustments to revenue accordingly 
we receive a portion of our interstate access revenues in our rlec segments from settlement pools in which we participate with other telephone companies through the national exchange carrier association  inc neca 
these pools were established at the direction of the fcc and are funded by interstate access service revenues  which the fcc regulates 
revenues earned through this pooling process are initially recognized based on estimates and are subject to adjustments that may either increase or decrease the amount of interstate access revenues 
if the actual amounts that we receive from or pay into the settlement pools differ from the amounts that we have recorded as accounts receivables or accrued liabilities on our balance sheets  we are required to record the amount of such a reduction or increase as an adjustment to our earnings 
until december  we did not experience significant adjustments to our revenues as a result of our participation in these pools 
in december  we recorded an increase in communications service revenue of as a result of a change in our estimated interstate revenue earned from the neca pooling process 
we revised our estimate  based on a recent decision rendered by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  which reaffirmed a fcc rule that mandates that refunds payable to long distance communication providers are not required for periods in which interstate rate of return revenues exceed fcc authorized levels if the rates for those periods were deemed to be lawful rates 
in december  we recorded communication service revenue of related to this estimate 
neca s access rates  in which our rlecs concur  were filed and approved consistent with the fcc s deemed lawful rules 
regulated asset depreciation we use a composite group remaining life method and straight line composite rates to depreciate the regulated property assets of our rlec and clec segments 
under this method  when we replace or retire such assets  the original cost of the asset  net of any salvage  is charged to accumulated depreciation 
the effect of this accounting is to amortize any gains or losses on dispositions over the service lives of the remaining regulated telephone property assets rather than recognizing such gain or loss in the period of retirement 
in addition  use of the composite group remaining life method requires that we periodically revise our depreciation rates 
such revisions are based on asset retirement activity  and often require that we make related estimates and assumptions 
if actual outcomes differ from our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to adjust depreciation and amortization expense  which could impact our earnings 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including our property  plant and equipment and our finite lived intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability is assessed based on future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment loss  if indicated  would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
while we have never recorded a material impairment charge for long lived assets  future events or changes in circumstances could result in a material charge to earnings 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are no longer subject to amortization 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by comparing carrying value to fair value 
there is a 
table of contents two step process for goodwill 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of reporting units to their carrying value 
if the results of the first step of the impairment testing indicate a potential impairment  the second step would be completed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balances of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable 
in evaluating impairment  we estimate the sum of the expected future cash flows derived from such goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses  the market price of our stock and other factors 
while we have never recorded a material impairment charge for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  future events or changes in circumstances could result in a material charge to earnings 
investment in unconsolidated affiliates we have investments and advances to affiliated entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
we periodically evaluate whether there have been declines in value in these investments  and if so  whether these declines are considered temporary or other than temporary 
other than temporary declines would be recognized as realized losses in earnings 
evidence of a loss in value includes  but is not limited to  our inability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity  which would justify the carrying amount of the investment 
the fair value of an investment that is less than its book value may indicate a loss in value of the investment 
our evaluations are based on many factors  including the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than carrying amount  the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow factors  and our intent and ability to hold the investment  including strategic factors 
retirement benefits retirement benefits are a significant cost of doing business and yet represent obligations that will be settled in the future 
retirement benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by a company 
we record the costs of providing retirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions 
in december  we adopted sfas no 
r  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  which provides expanded disclosures related to our employee benefit plans 
our estimates include assumptions regarding the discount rate to value the future obligation and the expected return on our plan assets 
we use discount rates in line with current market interest rates on high quality fixed rate debt securities 
our return on assets is based on our current expectation of the long term returns on assets held by the plan 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligations  funding requirements and periodic benefit costs that we incur 
our pension expense for would have increased approximately if our assumed investment return were one quarter of a percent lower 
the expense would have increased approximately if our assumed discount rate were one quarter of a percent lower or decreased if our assumed discount rate were one quarter of a percent higher 
income taxes we file a consolidated federal income tax return 
we have two categories of income taxes current and deferred 
current taxes are those amounts we expect to pay when we file our tax returns 
since we must report some of our revenues and expenses differently for our financial statements than we do for income tax purposes  we record the tax effects of those differences as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are currently in effect 
management s judgment is required in determining the provision for current income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
a valuation 
table of contents allowance is established for any deferred tax asset that we may not be able to use in the preparation and filing of our future tax returns 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r revises fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this standard requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted to employees including stock options and discount stock purchase plans 
sfas no 
r requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the compensation cost of the award is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service  ie the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  d e expects to adopt this standard in july under the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  a company records compensation expense for all new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the required effective date 
additionally  compensation expense is recorded for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
the cost of the unvested portion of the award is recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the required effective date 
the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions apb  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of assets exchanged  with certain exceptions 
sfas amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company s adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  sfas which clarifies the types of costs that should be expensed rather than capitalized as inventory 
this statement also clarifies the circumstances under which fixed overhead costs associated with operating facilities involved in inventory processing should be capitalized 
the provisions of sfas no 
are applied prospectively and are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on october   the american jobs creation act was signed into law 
this new law contains numerous changes to existing tax laws  including both domestic and foreign tax incentives 
in december  the fasb issued two staff positions fsp that provide accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the american jobs creation act 
fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  states that the manufacturers deduction provided for under this legislation should be accounted for as a special deduction instead of a tax rate change

in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was enacted into law 
the act provides a voluntary prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care plans that provide at least an actuarially equivalent benefit 
in may  the fasb issued staff position no 
fsp fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fas 
fas provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the new medicare prescription drug benefit and the related federal subsidy available to employers whose prescription drug benefits are at least actuarially equivalent to the drug benefit provided under medicare part d 
based upon this guidance  the company did not believe its postretirement health care plans were actuarially equivalent 
in january  the centers for medicare and medicaid services issued final guidelines to define actuarial equivalence under the regulations 
the company is evaluating the january guidelines to determine if the benefits provided by the company s plan are at least actuarially equivalent to benefits available though medicare part d under these new guidelines 
accordingly  the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the net periodic postretirement benefit cost reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes do not reflect any effect of the federal subsidy provided by the act 
in january  d e adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
this statement establishes accounting practices relating to legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal operation of a long lived asset 
sfas requires that companies recognize the fair value of a liability for asset retirement obligations in the period in which the legal obligations are incurred and capitalize that amount as a part of the book value of the long lived asset 
that cost is then depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying long lived asset 
d e recorded an after tax benefit of as a cumulative effect accounting adjustment in the first quarter the adjustment represents the cumulative estimate of cost of removal charged to depreciation expense in earlier years for which d e does not have a legal obligation associated with the retirement of the related tangible long lived assets 
the adoption of this pronouncement had no material effect on d e s ongoing financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies how to identify variable interest entities vies and how a company should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate the entity 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   in which a company obtains an interest after that date 
in december  the fasb issued fin r  a revision to fasb interpretation no 
which among other things  defers the effective date of implementation for certain entities 
the revised interpretation is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march   with the exception of special purpose entities for which the statement is effective for periods ending after december  the company does not have any special purpose entities 
fin r requires the consolidation of entities which are determined to be vies when the reporting company determines that it will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses  receive a majority of the vies residual returns  or both 
an entity is considered to be a vie when its capital is insufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or its equity investors lack the characteristics of having a controlling financial interest 
d e has one significant variable interest entity through its ownership interest in eurotel  llc eurotel 
d e owns a one third investment in eurotel  a domestic corporate joint venture 
eurotel holds a investment in pennecom  bv pennecom  an international telecommunications holding company  and 
table of contents holds a investment in pilicka  a telecommunications company located in poland 
d e has participated in this joint venture since january eurotel  pennecom and pilicka are referred to herein as our european affiliates 
d e s participation in this joint venture has been to provide working capital for the development of pilicka s telephone business in poland and to manage eurotel s investments 
eurotel has assets of approximately  with no annual operating revenue 
d e s exposure to loss from its involvement in eurotel continues at one third of eurotel s losses 
based on the accounting guidance of fin r  d e has determined it is not the primary beneficiary of this entity 
according to the guidance of fin r  consolidation of eurotel is not required and thus there is no effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s 
we are highly leveraged and  as a result  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
our debt obligations are us dollar denominated 
our market risk  therefore  is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and changes in our leverage ratio which may increase the margin added to the interest rate as provided in our loan agreement 
as of december   our debt can be categorized as follows in thousands fixed interest rates secured term loans subject to interest rate fluctuations senior secured revolving credit facility senior secured term loans as part of our loan covenant conditions  we have arranged interest rate protection on a minimum of one half of the total amount of senior indebtedness outstanding  with a weighted average life of at least years 
as of december   our bank debt is as follows principal average rate fair value rates fixed for three years through interest rate swaps rates fixed for four years through interest rate swaps rates fixed for four years through interest rate swaps fixed rate debt  rates fixed for twelve years total fixed rates of total debt variable rate debt of total debt if interest rates rise above the rates of the variable debt  we could incur extra interest expense of for each basis points above the current rates 
if rates were to decline  we would realize reductions in interest expense of approximately for each basis point decrease in rates 
the interest rate swaps were arranged to hedge against the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
the swaps were arranged with three banks that participate in our senior indebtedness 
under these interest rate swap contracts  we agree to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in turn an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the notional amounts of the contracts are not exchanged 
net interest positions are settled quarterly 
terms of swaps notional amounts average pay rate average received rate fair value to to to 
table of contents if interest rates rise above the rates fixed by these swaps  we could realize other income of for each basis points above the fixed rates 
if rates were to decline  we would realize other expense of approximately for each basis point decrease in rates 
our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments having initial maturities of three months or less 
while these investments are subject to a degree of interest rate risk  it is not considered to be material
