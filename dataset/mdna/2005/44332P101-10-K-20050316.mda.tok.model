overview hub is a leading north american insurance brokerage that has grown rapidly since its formation in through mergers  acquisitions and organic growth 
we provide a broad array of property and casualty  life and health  employee benefits  investment and risk management products and services through offices located in the united states and canada 
we are pursuing a growth strategy that includes expansion of our geographic footprint across the united states and deeper penetration of the insurance brokerage market in both the united states and canada 
both acquisitions and internal growth are core components of our strategic plan for revenue expansion 
as of december   our operations included regional hub brokerages nine in the united states and five in canada and nearly offices staffed by approximately  people 
our strategic plan calls for the addition of approximately additional us hubs to extend our geographic footprint 
brokerages large enough to be considered hubs will generally have annual revenue in excess of million 
in addition to larger  hub acquisitions by the parent corporation  each regional hub is tasked with pursuing smaller  fold in acquisitions that either expand its geographic penetration or add new specialization or expertise to the regional operation 
we generally acquire larger  hub brokerages  for a combination of cash and stock 
although there are variations in the purchase terms for each hub  our goal is to pay of the hub purchase price in our common stock  while setting escrow periods of up to years for the sellers to hold these shares 
we believe the use of escrowed stock in major acquisitions creates increased alignment of interests between senior managers and the public shareholders of the corporation 
we have paid all cash for the acquisition of certain brokerages  and may pay an all cash purchase price for brokerages in the future 
as of december   senior managers of the company and its hubs owned approximately  shares  or of total shares outstanding  while all employees as a group held approximately  shares  or of total shares outstanding 
during the three years ended december   we acquired brokerages in the united states and another brokerages in canada  adding combined revenue of million from the dates of acquisition 
of these acquisitions  were regional hubs  all based in the united states 
united states revenue has grown to of our total revenue primarily as a result of acquisitions and organic growth 
organic growth is similar to the same store sales calculation used by retailers 
it includes revenue growth from units included in our financial statements for at least months 
because we apply the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  acquired brokerages financial results are included only from the date of acquisition 
we acquired brokerages with aggregate annual revenue of million in  up from approximately million of acquired revenue in our management believes pricing discipline is a key to successful acquisition efforts and has chosen not to complete potential acquisitions that did not meet our pricing criteria 
we have a goal of acquiring an average of hub operations per year  increasing our base of us hubs to from the current acquisitions will be driven by opportunity  pricing and fit  however  not by a rigid timetable 
annual report december  hub international limited 
table of contents in accordance with our strategic plan  on july  we purchased talbot financial corporation  talbot based in new mexico 
we purchased all of the common shares of satellite acquisition corporation satellite  a corporation formed by senior management at talbot 
in turn  satellite purchased of talbot from safeco corporation for million in cash 
we will purchase talbot management s special shares of satellite over the next three years  using a combination of both our restricted and unrestricted common shares 
payments will be made on september   march  and march  based upon talbot s earnings for the month period ending december   and  respectively 
the contingent payments to talbot management are a charge to earnings in the form of non cash stock based compensation expense over the period in which the payments are earned 
based on talbot s financial performance for  we anticipate total earnout payments in the million range 
during the third and fourth quarter of we expensed million of non cash stock based compensation related to this acquisition 
our revenue base is diversified across a large number of insurance products and services  including commercial insurance property and casualty employee benefits risk management services business property group life and health claims management auto and trucking fleets employment issues risk finance structuring technology human resources exposure evaluation intellectual property retirement plans coverage analysis natural disaster contract review contract review workers compensation liability surety bonds business income accounts receivable environmental risks personal insurance property and casualty life  health and financial home disability personal property life auto and recreational vehicles investments travel accident and trip cancellation financial planning commercial lines have increased to of our total revenue  largely as a result of our more rapid expansion in the united states  where middle market companies and other commercial clients are the primary source of revenue 
in  commercial lines constituted of us revenue and of canadian revenue 
in british columbia canada  we are the largest broker of government underwritten auto insurance  a personal line 
in addition  canada s public health care system eliminates a significant portion of the demand for employer provided health insurance  a major commercial product line for us in the united states 
we employ a number of distribution channels to deliver products and services to clients 
among the distribution channels we employ are retail sales and service centers that target middle market companies  providing a broad range of property and casualty insurance  life and health insurance  risk management and financial services  retail call centers provide sales and services by telephone to individuals or members of employee groups  associations  affinity groups and specific communities 
we operate call centers in chicago and chilliwack  british columbia  hub international limited annual report december  
table of contents wholesale life and financial services centers  known as managing general agents  provide life  financial and investment products and expertise to independent agents on a wholesale basis from our locations in vancouver  calgary  montreal  toronto  san francisco  albuquerque and mechanicsburg  pa  and wholesale property and casualty insurance centers provide products  international risk solutions  captive management programs and specialty lines to independent brokers and corporations in north america and globally from offices in new york  toronto  montreal and vancouver 
in addition  we are a member of the worldwide broker network  a consortium of international brokerages which we can access to service us or canadian clients who require insurance internationally 
we have a diverse mix of products  services  insurer relationships and distribution channels  and as a result  our revenue and profitability levels are not usually highly susceptible to major changes related to a single product or service 
however  general economic trends may influence overall insurance rates  commissions and availability or costs of individual types of coverage  which in turn may affect our revenue and profitability levels 
our ability to achieve organic revenue growth is not solely dependent on rising or declining rates  but results from a more complex mixture of general economic growth  access to coverage from insurers and marketing sales expertise 
during the s  insurance rates were generally considered low  or soft  as insurance companies sought to maximize the flow of premium dollars that they could invest profitably in a rising stock market and in other investments 
beginning in  as return on investment began to shrink  insurance rates began to rise  or harden  at a pace that accelerated rapidly after the terrorist attacks of september  during the two years after september   premium rates remained firm for most types of coverage  rising to per year in many cases 
during the latter part of  the canadian market remained firm  but the us market experienced some softening of premium rates for property and casualty coverage 
during the first six months of  canadian and us markets both softened  although rates for certain types of coverage continued to increase 
during the third and fourth quarters of however  insurance rates for many types of coverage began falling at a much more rapid pace than during the first six months of the year 
for us  as for other brokers  falling rates can present both positive and negative effects 
falling premiums yield less commission income  if the insurance buyer maintains its coverage levels 
however  many insurance buyers will respond to falling rates by increasing total coverage  often by lowering deductibles  increasing limits of coverage  or by adding new risks to those already insured 
although insurance rates fell during the last six months of we have not yet experienced any significant positive reactions from insurance buyers  although we expect we may in the months ahead 
in addition  the economic environment could lead to higher or lower sales and employee headcounts at client companies  leading in turn to increased or reduced demand for employee benefits  liability and other types of coverage tied to business activity levels 
our strategic plan has traditionally included a highly decentralized structure that offered a large degree of autonomy to each regional hub operation 
we have sought to acquire strong businesses and retain the services and commitment of the management teams that built those businesses successfully 
decentralization has been a core component of this growth plan 
in we began investing more in the coordination of additional functions from our head office to enhance a cross selling  international collaboration  marketing efficiencies  total expense management and financial control initiatives 
because we are a service organization  compensation and other personnel costs make up the largest component of total expenses in property and equipment are comprised primarily of furniture  computer systems and office equipment 
therefore  hub s capital resources  including external borrowings  internally generated cash flow and issuance of common shares  are targeted primarily toward acquisitions

loss on write off of trademarks in january  we adopted a corporate marketing and positioning strategy to build awareness of the hub brand across all of our markets and to encourage greater coordination and collegial identity among our employees 
as part of this corporate consolidation and identity development program  we have reassigned a number of key executives to new or expanded areas of responsibility and determined that future marketing and communications will be conducted under the hub international name  rather than the traditional corporate names of acquired brokerages

lender placed coverage is primarily collision coverage on automobiles financed through a financial institution

hard insurance pricing in contributed strongly to a significant increase in contingent profitability income from insurers in  as these insurers benefited from the near term impact of higher rates implemented in in the united states  our brokerages benefited from new business generation  additional revenue from businesses acquired during and moderate premium rate increases 
while higher premium rates on most product lines added nominally to total premium amounts  client response to higher rates often included a reduction in total coverage  increasing deductibles and other cost savings techniques 
in addition  the relative weakness in the us economy led to declines in sales levels and staff headcount at many of our clients

apart from foreign currency gains  in canada  our brokerages benefited from strong organic growth and a sustained pace of increases in insurance premium rates 
canadian rate trends have trailed those of the united states 
because canadian revenue includes a lower percentage of commercial business and more personal lines  any acceleration in economic growth that adds to payrolls is not expected to have as strong a benefit in canada as in the united states 
the strong rate of organic growth in canada reflected both increased market penetration and continued strength in premium rates 
our strong relationships with and access to insurers in canada proved to be an important competitive advantage in  leading to increased sales to clients who were unable to obtain coverage from other sources 
as was the case in the united states  canadian operations benefited strongly from an increase in contingent commissions and volume overrides  which grew in  versus a decline of in compensation expense the majority of our expenses are related to compensation  which increased in to million

the amount of restricted share units issued was based upon a multiple of the previous two years average bonus 
the restricted share units will all vest in full on january  subject to continued employment 
although the impact of this change is expected to be earnings neutral in  the long term effect is to reduce compensation costs as a percentage of revenue

as of december  we were in compliance with all financial covenants governing the senior notes 
on july   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
the effect of the swap is to convert the fixed rate interest payments of senior notes and senior notes in amounts of million and million  respectively  to a floating rate of approximately and  respectively 
we account for the swap transaction using the synthetic instruments method under which the net interest expense on the swap and associated debt is reported in earnings as if it were a single  synthetic  financial instrument 
as at december   we estimated the hub international limited annual report december  
table of contents fair value of the swap to be million  which is not recognized in our financial statements 
accordingly  million is the estimated amount that we would need to pay to terminate the swap as of december  also at december  we had outstanding a million term loan from an insurance carrier with which we place insurance 
the terms of the loan provide for an incentive arrangement whereby a credit can be earned that will reduce annual interest payments under the loan based on target premiums placed with the carrier and reduces the principal repayment due in february based on both target premiums placed with the carrier as well as the loss ratio on premiums placed with the carrier 
credits earned for and reduced interest payments to zero from for both years

we intend to repay these liabilities from internally generated cash flow  existing cash balances and or borrowings under our credit facilities as the subsidiary debt becomes due during through of the outstanding subsidiary debt  million is secured by liens on certain assets of our subsidiaries 
also at december   we had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due june  held by certain subsidiaries of fairfax the fairfax notes 
the fairfax notes are convertible by the holders at any time into our common shares at c per share 
if fairfax had converted all of the fairfax notes  fairfax would have owned approximately of our total outstanding common shares as of december   versus the of outstanding shares which it held on that date 
at the close of  our cash position included approximately million deployed as working capital at the brokerage level and approximately million available for acquisitions 
this amount combined with available lines of credit leaves us with a total amount of million available for acquisitions 
it is impossible to define exactly how many acquisitions or how much new revenue could be acquired through the use of this cash  additional cash flow from operations and application of credit facilities  as acquisition pricing and other factors vary during the course of the year 
however  we intend to use our common shares as consideration for approximately of the value of a hub acquisition  and generally have paid a multiple of times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization frequently referred to as ebitda  which is not a gaap measure for acquired brokerages

the new york attorney general subpoenaed information on such compensation agreements from several other major insurance brokers and insurance companies as well 
such compensation agreements  also known as contingent agreements  between insurance companies and brokers are a long standing and common practice within the insurance industry 
hub northeast discloses such agreements on its invoices to clients and on its web site

we continue to fully cooperate with the attorney general s inquiry 
promptly after hub northeast s receipt of the first new york attorney general s subpoena  we retained external counsel to assist us in responding to the new york attorney general s inquiries and  among other things  requested that such external counsel conduct a thorough investigation of hub northeast to determine whether any current or former employee engaged in the practice of falsifying or inflating insurance quotes 
such investigation of hub northeast is substantially complete 
subsequently  outside counsel s investigation was expanded to our other hubs  both for internal purposes and in the course of assisting us in responding to the inquiries of other regulatory authorities 
to date  management is unaware of any incidents of falsifying or inflating insurance quotes 
while it is not possible to predict the outcome of this investigation  if such compensation agreements were to be restricted or no longer permitted  our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
from august through february  various other subsidiaries of hub received and responded to letters of inquiry and subpoenas from authorities in california  connecticut  texas  illinois  delaware  pennsylvania  new hampshire and quebec 
in october  we were named as a defendant in a class action lawsuit the opticare case filed in federal district court in new york against different insurance brokers and insurance companies 
the lawsuit alleges that the defendants used the contingent commission structure to deprive policyholders of independent and unbiased brokerage services  as well as free and open competition in the market for insurance 
in december   we were also named as one of multiple defendants in two identical class actions filed in federal district court in illinois  with allegations substantially similar to those in the opticare case 
in january we were named as one of several defendants in a third class action filed in federal district court in illinois  containing allegations substantially similar to those in the opticare case and other illinois federal class actions 
none of the complaints contain any specific factual allegations against us  but rather generally assert that all of the broker defendants engaged in the types of conduct of which the new york attorney general charged the marsh mclennan companies in his suit against them 
on february  the federal judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred the opticare case as well as three other class actions in which we are not named to the district of new jersey 
we expect that the three class actions filed in federal district court in illinois will also be transferred to new jersey 
we deny the allegations made in these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend these cases 
in january  we and our affiliates were named as defendants in a class action filed in the circuit court of cook county  illinois 
the named plaintiff is a chicago law firm that obtained its professional liability insurance through hub international of illinois limited formerly mack and parker  inc and claims that an undisclosed contingent commission was received with respect to its policy 
we deny this and the other allegations of the complaint and intend to vigorously defend this case 
we did not record a liability at december  related to the above contingent liabilities 
in connection with our executive share purchase plan  under certain circumstances  we may be obligated to purchase loans for officers  directors and employees from a canadian chartered bank totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively  to assist in purchasing our common shares

shares reserved for issuance 
as of december   million common shares were reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plan of which approximately million stock options and restricted share units were outstanding 
shareholders equity increased by million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  this increase resulted from net earnings of million  an increase in contributed surplus of million related primarily to non cash stock based compensation  million due to shares issued in conjunction with acquisitions  million due to shares issued in conjunction with the contingent consideration payments  an exercise of stock options for million  and an increase in the cumulative translation account of million  due mainly to the strengthening of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar in 
the increase in shareholders equity was offset by the declaration of dividends of million in market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our senior notes due to the interest rate swap entered into in  which converted the fixed rate interest payments on the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding into floating rate payments and on our revolving us dollar libor loan 
as a result each basis point increase in interest rates charged on the balance of our outstanding floating rate debt as of december  will result in approximately million decrease in our earnings 
exchange rate sensitivity we report our revenue in us dollars 
our canadian operations earn revenue and incur expenses in canadian dollars 
given our significant canadian dollar revenue  we are sensitive to the fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollar and are therefore exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
foreign currency exchange risk is the potential for loss in revenue and net income as a result of a decline in the us dollar value of canadian dollar revenue due to a decline in the value of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar 
the canadian dollar is subject to volatility 
it experienced a significant decline in its value compared to the us dollar in but has increased significantly in value throughout and at december  and one us dollar equaled and canadian dollars  respectively 
the table below summarizes the effect that a decline or increase in the value of the canadian dollar would have had on our revenue  net earnings and cumulative translation account for the twelve months ended december   and in millions of us dollars  except percentages revenue net earnings cumulative translation account the increasing proportion of our revenue derived from our us operations and earned in us dollars has  in part  offset the potential risk of a decline in the canadian dollar 
we expect that the proportion of revenue earned in us dollars will continue to increase  further mitigating our foreign currency exchange sensitivity

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets arising from acquisitions consist of the following in thousands of us dollars customer relationships non competition covenants trademarks goodwill accumulated amortization total we completed our impairment testing on the balance of goodwill and intangible assets as of january   and based on the testing performed  no impairment losses were incurred 
the amounts allocated to customer relationships were determined by discounting the expected future net cash flows from commissions with consideration given to remaining economic lives  renewals  and associated expenses 
the amounts allocated to non competition covenants were determined using an income approach with consideration given to economic benefits associated with having the covenants in place versus damages that would ensue absent the agreements 
in the case of trademarks  a cash flow royalty savings approach  addressing the economic benefits of the trademarks to hub was used 
the balance of the excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill 
customer relationships are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic useful life  typically ten to fifteen years 
many factors outside our control determine the persistency of our customer relationships and we cannot be sure that the value we have allocated will ultimately be realized 
non competition covenants are intangible assets that have an indefinite life and accordingly  are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment 
when an employee leaves hub  the non competition covenant becomes effective and the value assigned is then amortized over the life of the covenant 
during the first quarter  certain of our subsidiaries initiated a plan to change their names and as a result we recognized a non cash loss on the write off of trademarks of million before tax

off balance sheet transactions under canadian gaap  we use the synthetic instruments method to account for the interest rate swap transaction which converted fixed rate interest payments of and on the senior notes of million and million  respectively to a floating rate of approximately and for and  respectively 
under this method  we report in earnings the net interest expense on the swap and associated debt as if it were a single  synthetic  financial instrument 
the fair value of the swap  estimated at million is not recognized in our canadian gaap financial statements 
under us gaap  we have designated the swap transaction as a hedge of changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt caused by changes in interest rates and record the swap on our us gaap balance sheet at its fair value 
changes in the fair value of the swap are reported in earnings 
changes in the fair value of the debt being hedged which are attributable to changes in interest rates are recognized in earnings by adjustment of the carrying amount of the debt 
we have no other material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting polices are more fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to hub international limited annual report december  
table of contents determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts and policies  our observance of trends in the insurance industry  information provided by our clients and information provided by outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policies include the recognition of commission income  the allocation of the purchase price of an acquisition  the measurement of goodwill and other intangibles and related impairment evaluation  and the valuation of stock based compensation 
these policies are discussed below 
recognition of commission income we recognize commission income and fees as of the effective date of our client s policy unless information is not available relating to the determination of their policy premiums  in which case we recognize commission income and fees related to that policy when that information becomes available and the revenue can be reasonably determined 
we maintain an allowance for estimated policy cancellations and commission returns based upon the application of historical policy cancellation and commission return rates to the current year revenue  adjusted for any known deviations 
the allowance for estimated policy cancellations is based on our management s judgment  and is regularly evaluated by management by taking into consideration factors such as changes in the nature and volume of policies  trends in actual and forecasted policy cancellations  and current economic conditions that may affect the likelihood of client policy changes or cancellations 
if our actual policy cancellation rates are significantly different from our historical policy cancellation rates  and those changes have not been adjusted for in the allowance  our actual commission income may be significantly different from what we estimated 
allocation of the purchase price of an acquisition the acquisition of new brokerages is a fundamental component of our strategy 
when we acquire a business  the cost of the purchase is allocated to all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
any excess of the cost of purchase over the net of the allocated amounts is recognized as goodwill 
for significant acquisitions  we engage qualified third party valuators to assist us in conducting asset valuations 
the fair value of assets  including intangible assets  and liabilities may be determined using a number of valuation methods including net realizable values  market prices and discounted cash flows 
the use of assumptions and estimates is inherent in each of these valuation methods 
valuation methods and their underlying assumptions and estimates are based on management s judgment 
the use of different judgments  estimates  or assumptions could produce different allocations of the purchase price and  as a result  different results of operations 
for acquisitions where part of the consideration paid has the character of compensation rather than purchase price  we account for such payment as an expense 
where such compensation is stock based  our accounting policy for stock based compensation is followed 
the fair value of such compensation is a significant estimate 
the use of different estimates could produce results that are significantly different than our results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets primarily represent goodwill  associated with our acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of purchase of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we do  however  test these assets at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we determine impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value of a reporting unit may be determined using a number of market valuation methods including quoted market prices  discounted cash flows and net realizable values 
the use of assumptions and estimates is inherent in each of these valuation techniques 
the valuation method and the underlying assumptions and estimates are based on management s judgment 
the use of different judgments  estimates and assumptions could produce different results in the application of the impairment tests and  as a result  significantly different results of operations 
the cost of definite lived intangible assets is amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the assets 
we regularly evaluate whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of intangibles  other annual report december  hub international limited 
table of contents than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  may warrant revision or may not be recoverable 
the estimation of the useful economic lives and the selection of estimates and assumptions used in conducting impairment tests require the exercise of judgment 
the use of different judgments  estimates and assumptions could produce different results in the application of the impairment tests of the assets and  as a result  significantly different results of operations 
stock based compensation stock based compensation includes both stock options  restricted shares and restricted share units 
our accounting policy is to recognize the fair value of stock based compensation as an expense over the period in which entitlement to the compensation vests 
we measure the fair value of stock options at the date of grant of the award and recognize this amount as compensation expense over the vesting period of the options 
we estimate the fair value of the stock options granted using the black scholes valuation model  which requires us to make assumptions in relation to the expected term of the stock option  volatility in the price of the underlying common shares  interest rates and dividend yield 
the fair value model is particularly sensitive to the changes in the price and price volatility of our common shares 
the assumptions used are based on our management s judgment and the use of different judgments  estimates  and assumptions could produce significantly different results of fair value of the stock options and  as a result  significantly different results of operations 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements the canadian accounting standards board has issued two new accounting standards that will affect the company in these new standards align canadian gaap to us gaap 
accordingly  information currently presented in our reconciliation to us gaap note will be incorporated into our financial statements and these gaap differences will be eliminated 
financial instruments recognition and measurement new section will affect our reporting of our interest rate swap whereby the swap will be recorded on our balance sheet at its fair value 
currently  the fair value of the swap is not recognized on our balance sheet 
comprehensive income new section establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income 
unrealized gains and losses on debt and equity securities as well as foreign currency translation adjustments will be included in comprehensive income 
currently  we do not record these unrealized gains and losses and foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in equity through the cumulative translation account
