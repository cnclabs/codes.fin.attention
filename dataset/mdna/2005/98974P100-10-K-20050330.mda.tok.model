table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company operates in a single reporting segment  providing solutions that protect  manage  and deliver sensitive electronic information 
these solutions are grouped into two categories communications protection and care delivery solutions 
by offering two different but interrelated product lines  the company protects organizations from viruses and spam  provides the management tools needed for web access control and policy driven email encryption  and provides care delivery solutions for e prescribing and e lab results that enable physicians and patients to leverage technology for better patient care 
since january  the company has developed and marketed products and services that bring privacy  security  and convenience to internet users 
in the first quarter of  the company first introduced zixmail  a desktop solution for encrypting and securely delivering email  and began focusing its sales and marketing efforts toward the business market 
in and  the company significantly expanded its portfolio of commercial services and rebuilt its sales and marketing work force under new executive leadership 
the expanded communications protection portfolio of commercial products and services included zixvpm virtual private messenger  an e messaging gateway solution that provides company wide privacy protection for inbound and outbound email communications  zixauditor  an assessment service used to analyze email traffic patterns and monitor compliance with corporate and regulatory policies  and zixport  a secure web messaging portal 
further  the company has targeted the healthcare sector  where the legislated mandates of the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa  a law that requires protected health information to be safeguarded over open networks  are driving demand 
the privacy regulations for this law took effect in april and the security regulations is scheduled to go into effect in april in july  the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets and the business of ohio based pocketscript  llc pocketscript  a privately held development stage enterprise that provides electronic prescription solutions for the healthcare industry 
this acquisition enabled the company to expand its services into care delivery solutions  specifically  the e prescribing marketplace  which is expected to grow significantly as more physicians leverage technology in delivering care 
this expansion is paired with the fact that the number of prescriptions written annually in the united states continues to increase and confidence in the safety of written prescriptions declines 
in september  the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets and the business of elron software  inc elron software or elron  a majority owned subsidiary of elron electronic industries ltd 
and a provider of anti spam  email content filtering and web filtering solutions 
in january  the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets and the business of mydoconline  inc mydoconline  a subsidiary of aventis pharmaceuticals  inc  the north american pharmaceuticals business of aventis sa 
mydoconline offers a variety of internet based healthcare services and is a provider of secure web based communications  disease management  online doctor visits  and laboratory information solutions 
on november   the company announced that it was terminating the connect service for online doctor visits  which is one of the products acquired in the mydoconline acquisition 
pocketscript  elron software  and mydoconline had incurred substantial operating losses in years preceding their acquisitions by zixcorp 
on march   the web inspector and message inspector product lines  which were acquired in the elron acquisition  were sold to cyberguard corporation see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the foundation of the company s business model is centered on the financial leverage expected to be generated by its various subscription and transaction based revenues that are believed to be predominantly recurring in nature and an efficient cost structure for its secure data center operations  the core of which is expected to remain relatively stable 
subscription fees are generally expected to be collected at the beginning of the subscription period generally on an annual basis and are recognized as revenue on a prorated basis over the length of the subscription period 
operating in emerging markets involves risks and uncertainties  and there are no assurances that the company will be successful in its efforts 
successful growth of an early stage enterprise is costly and highly competitive 
the company s growth depends on the timely development and market acceptance of its products and services 
in  the company and its recent acquisitions have incurred significant operating 
table of contents losses and the use of cash resources has continued at a substantial level 
the company anticipates further operating losses in in  the company will place a strong emphasis on actions to become cash flow breakeven 
this emphasis might entail cost reductions in the near term 
cost reductions could come in the form of workforce reductions  decreased investments in certain areas of the business  business divestitures sales or shut down  or geographic consolidation 
the company s plan is to eliminate cost in the areas of the business that are expected to continue to result in cash drain and emphasize the areas of the business that can become cash flow positive in the near to medium term 
strategic actions intended to achieve the goal of cash flow breakeven might have intended or unintended short term adverse effects on certain financial performance metrics for the company 
critical accounting policies property and equipment  long lived and other intangible assets  depreciation and amortization property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives as follows computer equipment and software three years  leasehold improvements the shorter of five years or the lease term  and office equipment  furniture and fixtures five years 
intangible assets  which were acquired in the third quarter of in connection with the acquisitions of pocketscript and elron software  and in the first quarter for mydoconline are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of three or four years 
the company reviews property and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property and equipment and intangible assets is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the projected undiscounted cash flows the property and equipment are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
leases a lease that meets the criteria for capitalization is recorded as an asset and depreciated 
if a lease does not meet the criteria for capitalization  it is classified as an operating lease and payments are recorded as rent expense 
the company has only one lease that is classified as a capital lease 
lease renewal options which the company is reasonably assured of using and the related payments are taken into account when initially classifying and recording the lease as a capital lease obligation or as straight line rent if an operating lease 
zixcorp had five leases with renewal terms at december  the company will likely only choose to exercise one of the five renewal options 
funds provided by the lessor for leasehold improvements are recorded as a deferred lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the lease term 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill  which resulted from the acquisition of elron software and mydoconline  is not being amortized 
goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth quarter annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment evaluation  the company has identified two separate reporting units communications protection and care delivery 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
further  in the event that the carrying amount of the company as a whole is greater than its market capitalization  there is a potential likelihood that some or all of its goodwill would be considered impaired 
no impairment of goodwill has been recognized for any of the periods presented 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  as promulgated by sop  software revenue recognition  sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  emerging issues task force eitf abstract no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and other related pronouncements 

table of contents the company develops  markets  licenses  and supports computer software products and services 
the company s services can be placed into several key revenue categories where each category has similar revenue recognition traits communications protection subscription based services  perpetual software license sales  the pocketscript e prescribing application  various transaction fees  and professional services 
a majority of the revenue generated by the company is through direct sales  however  the company employs a network of distributors and resellers 
under all service categories and distribution models  the company recognizes revenue after all of the following occur persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in the event the arrangement has multiple elements with delivered and undelivered elements  revenue for the delivered elements are recognized under the residual method only when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists to allocate the fair value of the total fees to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
occasionally  when zixcorp is engaged in a complex product deployment  customer acceptance may have to occur before the transaction is considered complete 
in this situation no revenue will be recognized until the customer accepts the product 
subscription based services include the communications protection services of zixmail  zixvpm  zixport  zixauditor  anti spam signature subscriptions  and anti virus subscriptions  as well as certain products acquired from mydoconline 
these services include delivering licensed software and providing customer support and secure electronic communications throughout the subscription period 
the customer is often provided an appliance during the subscription period with pre installed software or contractually subscribes to a zixdata center resident service 
in a subscription service  the customer typically does not own a perpetual right to a software license  but is instead granted the use of that license during the period of the subscription 
subscriptions are generally annual non refundable contracts 
the subscription period begins on the date specified by the parties when the service is fully functional for the customer  which is consequently deemed to be the date of acceptance 
revenues from subscription services are recorded as service revenue as the services are rendered from the date of acceptance over the subscription period 
subscription fees received from customers in advance are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenues ratably over the subscription period 
in  the company sold anti spam filtering  email content filtering  and web filtering solutions and certain products acquired from mydoconline to customers under perpetual licensing arrangements 
these perpetual software licenses are normally sold as part of multiple element arrangements that include annual maintenance and or subscription  and may include implementation or training services 
acceptance for these products is generally when delivered if they are self installable by the customer and upon installation if installation is required to be done by zixcorp professional services 
these products are primarily self installed 
where vsoe has not been established for undelivered elements  revenue for all elements is deferred until those elements are delivered or their fair values determined 
however  if vsoe is determinable for all of the undelivered elements  and the undelivered elements are not essential to the delivered elements  the company will defer recognition of the fair value related to the undelivered elements and recognize as revenue the remaining portion of the arrangement through application of the residual method 
evidence of vsoe for implementation and training services associated with the anti spam  email content filtering and web filtering arrangements is based upon standard billing rates and the estimated level of effort for the individuals expected to perform the related services 
installation and training revenues are recognized as the services are rendered 
the company establishes vsoe for maintenance based upon maintenance that was sold separately 
maintenance revenue is recognized over the term of the maintenance agreement  generally one year 
the company recognizes revenue on the pocketscript e prescribing service as a multiple element arrangement with separate units of accounting 
vsoe is determined for the undelivered elements  and the residual value is assigned to the hardware device and is recognized upon installation of the device at an end user location 
installation is determined by physical delivery of a functioning product 
the fair values of the undelivered elements relate to ongoing services and are recognized ratably over the period of the service 
the company establishes vsoe for the service elements based upon contract renewal rates or fair market values if the element is commonly sold by others 

table of contents some of the company s services incorporate a transaction fee per event occurrence or when predetermined usage levels have been reached 
these fees are recognized as revenue when the transaction occurs 
for contracts with customers to provide certain professional services as stand alone offerings  the company recognizes revenue as the services are rendered and utilizes the percentage of completion method when appropriate 
the company s products include various warranty provisions 
the company accrues warranty costs at the time it recognizes revenues 
warranty expense was not material to any period presented 
software development costs costs incurred in the development and testing of software used in the company s secure e messaging and e prescribing services related to research  project planning  training  maintenance and general and administrative activities  and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
the costs of relatively minor upgrades and enhancements to the software are also expensed as incurred 
certain costs incurred during development of these software applications  including costs of materials  services and payroll and payroll related costs for employees directly associated with the development project  qualify for capitalization 
due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of future net revenues to be generated from these services  all development costs incurred through december  related to such products have been expensed and are included in research and development expenses 
costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional costs would be capitalized 
no research and development costs have been capitalized because the company believes that technological feasibility is established concurrent with general release to customers 
stock based employee compensation the company has various stock based compensation plans covering employees and directors as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  the company used the intrinsic value method to account for stock based compensation plans under the provisions of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
management reviews its estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to the carrying value of long lived assets and goodwill  expected useful life of property and equipment and the valuation allowance for its us deferred tax assets 
revisions to such estimates are based upon currently available facts and circumstances 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting estimates are described below 
property and equipment  depreciation zixcorp s net property and equipment at december  was  with related depreciation of  recognized during the year 
as described in the critical accounting policies section of the management discussion and analysis  the various classifications of assets have different depreciation periods based on the asset s estimated useful life 
historically these estimates have been shown to closely correlate to the asset s actual useful life  however  any reasonable change in the estimated useful life on any of the company s assets would likely not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or operations 
long lived  other intangible assets and goodwill the company s long lived assets subject to amortization  comprised of identified intangibles and property and equipment aggregating  or of total assets at december   are reviewed for impairment when certain triggering events occur where there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired 
the amount of a potential 
table of contents impairment is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the value determined from a projected discounted cash flow method  using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
the discount rate currently used in these cases is 
assumptions are made with respect to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the related asset 
an impairment charge would be recorded for an amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeded the discounted projected net cash flows 
the company recorded an impairment charge of  related to the connect service acquired in the mydoconline acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during and  the company completed three acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in connection with these acquisitions were based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
the fair values were determined by management  generally based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and in two instances valuations prepared by independent appraisal experts 
the fair values have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
goodwill  totaling  or of total assets at december   represents the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired in the september acquisition of elron software and the january acquisition of mydoconline 
the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired 
evaluations for possible impairment are based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit including the assigned goodwill value 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the unit  market values of comparable businesses where available or the company s market capitalization based on outstanding stock values 
an impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of the unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the impairment test in used a discount rate of  estimated to be the company s weighted average cost of capital 
the resulting net present values of future cash flow by reporting unit were significantly greater than the carrying value of the reporting units 
additionally  and to test sensitivity to the discount rate assumption  the company utilized a rate of and achieved net present values of future estimated cash flows sufficiently greater than the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets 
the company also compared an allocated market capitalization of the company to the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets as a final test which also resulting in significant market value in excess of carry value for each reporting unit 
future changes made to the current estimates or assumptions  including such factors as order volumes and price levels  life spans of purchased technology  continuity of acquired customers  alternative uses for property and equipment and levels of operating expenses  could result in an unanticipated impairment charge from the write down of the company s long lived assets or goodwill 
deferred tax assets as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company recognizes deferred tax assets on its consolidated balance sheet if it is more likely than not that the subject net operating loss carryforwards and unused tax credits will be realized on future federal income tax returns 
at december   the company continued to provide a full valuation allowance against accumulated us deferred tax assets of approximately  reflecting the company s historical losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income 
if the company begins to generate us taxable income in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which its estimates and assumptions are based were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance no longer required 
reversal of all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that certain of the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 

table of contents results of operations revenues the company s revenues have grown substantially from through from success in the secure e messaging market  primarily driven by hipaa requirements in the healthcare industry  and from the acquisitions of new technologies  primarily anti spam  web filtering and e prescribing

approximately to of the backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue in excluding the aventis customer deposit and backlog assumed by cyberguard 
the timing of revenue is affected by both the length of time required to deploy a service and the length of the service 

table of contents a master services agreement was entered into with aventis  inc aventis for  on the same date as the mydoconline acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements for the performance  by zixcorp  of various future services 
the services are to be delivered in minimum amounts of   and  prior to january   january   and january   respectively 
the january  deadline was subsequently extended to april  aventis will forfeit any unused amounts annually if services are not requested by aventis in accordance with the terms of the master services agreement 
the services will be defined on an ongoing basis over the life of the agreement and valued in accordance with pricing for similar services rendered by the company to other customers 
aventis paid the  upon execution of the master services agreement 
since the company s services to be provided to aventis have not yet been fully defined  the  payment has been recorded as a customer deposit 
as the services are defined and priced in individual project agreements  the value of the defined element will be reclassified to deferred revenues and then recognized as revenue in accordance with applicable revenue recognition criteria 
the company is required to return to aventis any unused portion of the deposit only in the event of material breach of the contract by the company  in the event the company or a party employed or engaged by the company is debarred pursuant to the generic drug enforcement act of or similar state  local or foreign law  in the event zixcorp files for bankruptcy  or in the event of force majeure 
the company believes that it is unlikely any of these events will occur 
the company s obligations associated with the master services agreement are secured by a first priority lien on the company s property and equipment and accounts receivable 
as of december   the company has provided  of services to aventis under this master services agreement 
management follows several general metrics to gauge business performance and the results of these metrics can have an effect on management s estimate of future revenue 
these metrics include order input  backlog  renewal rate customer retention of secure e messaging service contracts observations of the mix of single year verses multi year service contracts for secure e messaging and deployments to physicians of the e prescribing products 
company wide order input for was  which excludes a  customer deposit from aventis 
this was a increase over the backlog at december  was  compared to a backlog of  at december  the renewal rate for secure e messaging customers was in excess of throughout the course of  comparable data for this figure is not readily available 
in the company has experienced an increase in the number of customers who elect to sign up for services for the standard offering of three years verses a one year term 
the company expects this preference for a longer contract term to continue in and the company has priced its services in a manner which encourages longer term contractual commitments from customers 
the primary demand for deployment of e prescribing devices in was insurance payors purchasing the devices and related services from the company for physicians in a sponsorship arrangement  whereby the payor sponsors certain physicians to receive the device and services from zixcorp 
during the company deployed pocketscript service to approximately  physicians under two such initiatives 
the larger of the two was the erx collaborative initiative a collaborative effort between tufts health plan and blue cross blue shield massachusetts  and neighborhood health plan and the other was the wellpoint initiative 
the company believes that the sponsorship model is currently the prevalent market demand model 
while the company has additional deployments to conduct under existing sponsorship agreements  growth in this area will require additional payor sponsors or a change in the market demand model 
cost of revenues in  the company s costs of revenue increased as the company s revenues increased 
cost of revenues rose substantially in while remaining relatively flat from to the increase in was almost entirely in the care delivery services and caused by the acquisition of mydoconline and investments made to enter the e prescribing market 
the costs of revenues for the different communications protection services were either flat or increased only slightly year on year 
at december   a substantial amount of the company s cost of revenues is not directly variable to revenues 
these costs represent the base 
table of contents cost required to provide the various service offerings such as the data center and the customer support function 
the company believes it has the capacity to grow revenues further  assuming market demand  while maintaining a growth in costs of revenue less than the revenue growth rate 
the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the company s cost of revenues variance variance year ended december  vs 
vs 
total cost of revenues the  net decrease in cost of revenues between and consists of a  decrease in non cash expenses offset by an increase of  in cash expenses 
the decrease in non cash expenses was primarily due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization for property and equipment of  resulting from certain data center equipment becoming fully depreciated  which was partially offset by  for amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of pocketscript and elron software 
the increase in cash expenses is due primarily to personnel additions totaling  which were necessary to expand the company s deployment and client services capabilities to support the order growth of the company s secure e messaging services 
additionally  with the company s increased volume of business coupled with the acquisitions of pocketscript and elron software  cash expenses increased over cash expenses by approximately  in each of the areas of travel  data center maintenance and support  and outside consultants  including professional fees associated with the company obtaining the aicpa systrust tm certification 
the  increase in cost of revenues between and is primarily due to incremental operating costs resulting from the acquisitions of pocketscript  inc  on july   elron software  inc  on september  and mydoconline on january   and increased headcount in to expand the company s deployment and client services capabilities to support the forecasted order growth of the company s care delivery services  primarily the deployment of e prescribing handheld devices 
personnel costs accounted for approximately  of the increase 
non personnel costs accounted for the remainder of the increase and consisted of significant cost elements including  for direct costs associated with the deployment of e prescribing handheld devices   for the amortization of intangible assets   for third party health information content license fees and royalties   for occupancy costs   for off site data center support costs associated with the mydoconline acquisition that were eliminated in the second quarter of with the migration of those support services into the company s data center   for travel related expenses and  for outside consulting services primarily associated with the three acquired businesses 
a significant portion of the company s cost of revenues has not been and is not expected to be directly variable to the revenue generated  such as the cost of operating and maintaining the zixdata center which is currently not fully utilized 
accordingly  costs associated with the data center are expected to grow at a much slower pace than revenue 
cost of revenues also includes the activities of field deployment  professional services and customer service and support 
the company has two product groupings  communications protection and care delivery 
the two categories have both distinct and shared costs of revenues 
most notable of the shared costs is the zixdata center 
management estimates and makes assumptions regarding these shared costs to calculate an estimated cost of revenues per reporting unit 
the total cost of revenues of  is estimated to be comprised of  relating to communications protection and  relating to care delivery  including allocations of shared costs 
the results show that communications protection has revenue in excess of the estimated costs of revenue and that additional revenue in this product line requires only modest increases in the costs of revenues 
for the communication protection services  in the near term  the company expects to continue growing the cost of revenues at rates less than the associated revenue growth rates for the same services and thus continue to improve the gross margin 
for the care delivery services in  the company experienced growth in cost of revenues in excess of the associated revenue 
as the deployment infrastructure for this service has now been built out to meet current and expected near term demands  in the near term  the 
table of contents company expects the costs of goods sold to increase less than the associated revenue for the same services 
future trends in the costs and revenues for care delivery are unknown and will depend on future demand 
additionally  other than the non cash amortization of the fair value of developed technology acquired with the purchase of elron software  cost of revenues related directly to software sales has not been significant 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased in versus a relatively consistent investment level between and the increase was the result of newly acquired products via business acquisition and increased focus on the e prescribing market 
the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the company s research and development expenses variance variance year ended december  vs 
vs 
total research and development the  net decrease in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to a  reduction in non cash expenses consisting primarily of a  decrease in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment resulting from certain computer equipment becoming fully depreciated and a  charge in for the cost to license certain patents held by tumbleweed communications corp 
these decreases in non cash expenses were partially offset by increased cash expenses of  most of which consisted of personnel costs resulting from the acquisitions of pocketscript and elron software in the third quarter of the  increase in research and development expenses between and is primarily due to incremental operating costs resulting from the acquisitions of pocketscript  inc  on july   elron software  inc  on september  and mydoconline on january  personnel costs accounted for approximately  of the increase 
non personnel costs accounted for the remainder of the increase and consisted primarily of  for outside consultants involved primarily in software development services   for in process research and development expense associated with the mydoconline acquisition   for common stock issued in lieu of cash compensation for employee bonuses and severance costs and  for travel related expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment resulting from certain equipment becoming fully depreciated

vs 
total selling  general and administrative expenses the  net increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was due to increased cash expenses of  and a decrease in non cash expense of  the increase in cash expenses was mainly caused by the acquisitions of elron and pocketscript in and related personnel and facilities costs 
in addition  legal fees decreased  as the company concluded its legal action against visa usa  inc and visa international service association in the decrease in non cash expenses was primarily due to a  decrease in stock based compensation related to stock option grants for employees and third party service providers and  recorded in for non recurring costs related to the yahoo inc advertising arrangement 

table of contents the  net increase in selling  general and administrative expenses between and is primarily due to incremental operating costs resulting from the acquisitions of pocketscript  inc  on july   elron software  inc  on september   and mydoconline  on january  the acquisition related personnel  facilities and intangible amortization expenses increased selling  general and administrative expense by approximately  in addition  audit and legal fees increased by  due to increased regulatory requirements but this was offset by a  decrease in advertising and promotion 
as a result of the company s continued focus on cost control  selling general and administration was reduced in the second half of verses the first half of while the company experienced increased costs in some areas  namely costs associated with new sarbanes oxley compliance requirements  reductions were made that offset and exceeded the increased corporate governance costs

company management determined that the company should reduce costs relating to the connect service which was a product acquired in the mydoconline acquisition 
the connect service is a subscription based web service that enables patients and physicians to securely communicate online for a variety of purposes  including online doctor visits  administrative questions  appointment requests  billing questions  prescription requests  and referral requests 
the company determined that continuing to operate the mydoconline connect service was not consistent with the company s business and financial goals 
accordingly  company management determined that it would suspend research and development investment for the connect service  cease sales and marketing efforts to obtain new customers for the connect service and  where reasonably feasible and appropriate  migrate existing connect customers to other vendors 
in reviewing the long lived asset value for the connect service  the company applied the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company s decision  as outlined above  significantly and adversely changed the extent and use of the connect service  for which the company has recorded an identifiable intangible asset 
the resulting test for recoverability resulted in an impairment to the developed technology of approximately  reflected in the company s financial results

table of contents improvements from secure messaging as a result of the subscription model of the business continued growth of secured e messaging business the company expects incremental cash receipts in the range of  to  compared to for the secure messaging products 
this growth is somewhat predicable based on past trends due to the subscription nature of the business  whereby  the company has been consistently adding new annual service contracts while experiencing very minimal attrition of existing and renewing customers 
at the low end of this range  the company assumes they will collect contractually billed amounts  experience continued renewal rates of  and continue new customer orders at the same rate demonstrated over the last years 
should new first year customer orders increase quarter on quarter throughout  the high end of the range should be reached 
based on the above  the company believes it has adequate resources and liquidity to sustain operations through and is targeting incremental cash flow improvements throughout the year to augment its liquidity going into however  operating in emerging markets involves risk and uncertainties  and there are no assurances that the company will ultimately achieve or achieve in a sufficiently timely manner its targeted improvements

recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
r  share based payment in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
it establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions with employees  and carries forward without change prior guidance for share based payments for transactions with non employees 
sfas r requires the fair value based method for measuring and recognizing the cost of stock based compensation 
when adopted  sfas no 
r will replace the intrinsic value measurement objective in apb opinion and will require companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires grant date fair value to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
such cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  the requisite service period which is usually the vesting period 
the standard also requires the company to estimate the number of instruments that will ultimately be issued  rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
zixcorp is required to apply sfas no 
r to all awards granted  modified or settled in our first reporting period after june  the company is also required to use either the modified prospective 
table of contents method or the modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  the company must recognize compensation cost for all awards granted after we adopt the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that are outstanding on that date 
under the modified retrospective method  we must restate our previously issued financial statements to recognize the amounts we previously calculated and reported on a pro forma basis  as if the prior standard had been adopted 
under both methods  companies are permitted to use either a straight line or an accelerated method to amortize the cost as an expense for awards with graded vesting 
the standard permits early adoption 
zixcorp has commenced analyzing the impact of sfas r  but have not yet decided whether the company will elect to adopt early  if the company elects to adopt early  then at what date would it do so  whether the company will use the modified prospective method or elect to use the modified retrospective method  and whether the company will elect to use straight line amortization or an accelerated method 
additionally  the company cannot predict with reasonable certainty the number of options that will be unvested and outstanding in the future 
accordingly  the company cannot currently quantify with precision the effect that this standard would have on its financial position or results of operations in the future  except that the company will probably recognize a greater expense for any awards that may be granted in the future than would have been recognized under current guidance

there is no assurance that any of our services will become generally accepted or that they will be compatible with any standards that become generally accepted  nor is there any assurance that enough paying users will ultimately be obtained to enable us to operate these businesses profitably 
failure to enter into new sponsorship agreements for or generate other revenue opportunities from our pocketscript e prescribing service could harm our business 
our pocketscript business has incurred significant operating losses 
in  orders for our pocketscript e prescribing service have come exclusively from sponsorship agreements with healthcare payors  such as health insurance companies  pharmacy benefit managers  or self insured companies 
under our payor sponsorship business model  the healthcare payor typically pays for the cost of deploying the pocketscript service to the end user physician and for the cost of a one year subscription to use the service 
all end user physicians who are using the pocketscript service and for whom we are currently recognizing revenue are doing so under a subscription arrangement that has been paid for by a healthcare payor 
although we believe that physicians will pay to use the pocketscript service following the one year of service paid for by the healthcare payors or that healthcare payors will extend their sponsorship  there is no assurance that they will do so 
failure to sign a follow on order with the one healthcare payor noted above or signing new sponsorship agreements with other payors in the coming months  or in identifying other revenue opportunities for our e prescribing services  such as add on applications  prescription transaction fees  and or new uses for the transaction data itself  will prevent us from achieving significant revenues from our e prescribing services 
competition in our businesses is expected to increase  which could cause our business to fail 
our zixcorp branded solutions are targeted to the secure e messaging protection and e transaction services market 
our pocketscript and mydoconline businesses are targeted toward the emerging markets for electronic prescriptions and online communication among the healthcare community 
as the public s and governmental authorities awareness about the need for privacy and security of electronic communications has increased over the past few years  an increasing number of competitors have entered the market 
although there are many large  well funded participants in the information technology security industry  few currently participate in the secure e messaging protection and e transaction services market in which our zixcorp branded solutions compete 
most other product only solutions in this market require extensive increases in overhead to implement and deploy them 
our zixcorp branded solutions can be made operational in a very short period of time compared to the longer procurement and deployment cycles common with the solutions of many of our competitors 
our service offerings are focused on the secure communications market  including secure e messaging and protection management 
companies that compete with our zixcorp branded secure e messaging and protection business include content management and secure delivery companies  such as tumbleweed communications corp 
and other secure delivery participants such as pgp corporation  certified mail  authentica  and sigaba corporation 
our zixcorp branded services and elron products also compete with several product companies that deliver anti virus solutions that may also contain limited email messaging spam protection capabilities  including mcafee  inc  sophos  inc  symantec corporation and trend micro  inc 
we also compete with companies that offer web filtering products  such as secure computing corporation  surfcontrol incorporated  websense  inc and netiq corp 

table of contents in addition  we face competition from vendors of internet server appliances  operating systems  networking hardware  network management solutions and security software  many of which now  or may in the future  develop or bundle secure e messaging  messaging spam protection and or web filtering capabilities into their products 
we may face increased competition as these competitors partner with others or develop new product and service offerings to expand the functionality that they can offer to their customers 
we believe that the secure e messaging  e prescribing and e transaction services market is growing  unlike many segments of the information technology security industry which are not growing 
our competitors may  over time  develop new technologies that are perceived as being more secure  effective or cost efficient than our own 
these competitors could successfully garner a significant share of the market  to the exclusion of our company 
furthermore  increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced margins or the failure of our business to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any of which could harm our business 
our pocketscript e prescribing service applies the benefits of e messaging to the medical prescription process by enabling providers to write and transmit prescriptions electronically from anywhere directly to the pharmacy 
our pocketscript service is expected to grow as more physicians leverage technology in delivering healthcare services  coupled with the fact that the number of prescriptions written annually in the united states continues to increase 
participants in the e prescribing space include allscripts healthcare solutions  ramp corporation  dr 
first  inc  instantdx llc  and iscribe 
competition from these companies and from vendors in related areas  such as electronic medical records vendors which are expected to include e prescribing services as an element of their service offering are expected to increase 
our mydoconline business offers an internet based healthcare service  dr 
chart 
dr 
chart is a web based communication tool that connects healthcare providers and laboratories by enabling doctors to initiate lab orders  check medical necessity compliance and view results rapidly and accurately using a secure internet connection 
competitors include medica  inc  atlas development corporation  careevolve  and labtest systems  inc 
all of the competitors offer the same basic services that dr 
chart offers 
we expect to face increasing competition in this arena and our competitors may develop products and services that are perceived to be better than ours 
our inability to successfully and timely develop and introduce new e messaging  e prescribing  and e transaction products and related applications and services and to implement technological changes could harm our business 
the emerging nature of the secure e messaging  e prescribing  and e transaction services business and its rapid evolution require us to continually develop and introduce new products and related applications and services and to improve the performance  features  and reliability of our existing solutions and related applications and services  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
we also have under development new feature sets for our current zixcorp branded service offerings and are considering new secure e messaging services 
the success of new or enhanced services depends on several factors primarily market acceptance 
we may not succeed in developing and marketing new or enhanced services that respond to competitive and technological developments and changing customer needs 
this could harm our business 
if the market for secure e messaging  e prescribing  and e transaction products and related applications and services does not continue to grow  demand for our services will be adversely affected 
the market for secure electronic communications is a developing market 
continued growth of the secure e messaging  e prescribing  and e transaction products and related applications and services market will depend  to a large extent  on the market recognizing the need for secure electronic communications  such as email encryption  e prescribing  and electronic lab e lab results 
failure of this market to grow would harm our business 
if healthcare providers fail to adopt the pocketscript and mydoconline solutions  we will fail to achieve the critical mass of physicians and patients to build a successful business 
our pocketscript e prescribing service and our mydoconline service are targeted to the emerging market for providing secure communications among healthcare providers to deliver information in an efficient  economical manner 
these are emerging markets  and the success of our pocketscript and mydoconline services is dependent  in large 
table of contents measure  on physicians and other healthcare providers changing the manner in which they conduct their medical practices by beginning to use secure wireless and internet communications channels to communicate with medical laboratories  payors  drug formularies  and others 
our challenge is to make these new businesses profitable 
to do so may require us to invest significant resources  including significant amounts of cash 
there is no assurance that enough paying users will ultimately be obtained to enable us to operate these businesses profitably 
in early november  we announced a material charge for impairment to an intangible asset of approximately  which was reflected in our third quarter financial results 
the asset impairment resulted from a decision of our management to suspend research and development and terminate sales and marketing efforts for our connect service  which was one of the products offered by the mydoconline portion of our business  because continuing to operate the service was not consistent with our goal of achieving cash flow breakeven 
it is possible that we may incur further charges for other asset impairments in the future as we evaluate the prospects of our various lines of business 
capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may be difficult to project  and we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems to meet increased use  which would result in reduced revenues 
while we have ample through put capacity to handle our customers requirements for the medium term  at some point we may be required to materially expand and upgrade our technology and network hardware and software 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in usage on our network  particularly since we have significantly expanded our potential customer base by our acquisition of pocketscript and mydoconline  whose service offerings are supported by our zixdata center 
in addition  we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware and software capabilities in a timely manner to accommodate increased traffic on our network 
if we do not timely and appropriately expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware and software  we may lose customers and revenues 
security interruptions to our data centers could disrupt our business  and any security breaches could expose us to liability and negatively impact customer demand for our services 
our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our data centers currently  our zixdata center located in dallas  texas  the austin  texas  data center used for fail over and business continuity services  and the mason  ohio data center used for quality assurance and staging of new customers of our pocketscript e prescribing service 
we must protect these centers from loss  damage  or interruption caused by fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  or other events beyond our control 
any damage or failure that causes interruptions in our data centers operations could materially harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  our ability to issue digitally signed certified time stamps and public encryption codes in connection with our zixcorp branded services and to support pocketscript s e prescribing service and mydoconline s service depends on the efficient operation of the internet connections between customers and our data centers 
we depend on internet service providers efficiently operating these connections 
these providers have experienced periodic operational problems or outages in the past 
any of these problems or outages could adversely affect customer satisfaction 
furthermore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and the market perceives them to be secure 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  attacks by hackers  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
in addition  we are vulnerable to coordinated attempts to overload our systems with data  resulting in denial or reduction of service to some or all of our users for a period of time 
we do not carry insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events  therefore  it is possible that we may have to use additional resources to address these problems 
secure messages sent through our zixport and zixmessage center messaging portals  in connection with the operation of our secure e messaging protection and e transaction services  include personal healthcare information as well as personal financial information 
this information will reside  for a user specified period of time  in our secure data center network  individual prescription histories transmitted through our pocketscript system will reside in our secure data center network  and the personal healthcare information transmitted through our mydoconline dr 
chart system will reside in our secure data center network 
federal and state laws impose significant financial penalties for unauthorized disclosure of personal healthcare 
table of contents information and personal financial information 
exposure of this information  resulting from any physical or electronic break ins or other security breaches or compromises of this information  could expose us to significant liability  and customers could be reluctant to use our internet related services 
pending litigation could have a material impact on our operating results and financial condition 
beginning in early september  several purported shareholder class action lawsuits and one purported shareholder derivative lawsuit were filed in the us district court for the northern district of texas against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
the purported class action lawsuits seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of purchasers of zixcorp s common stock between october  and may  the purported shareholder class action lawsuits allege that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements and or omissions in violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of the exchange act during this time period 
the purported shareholder derivative lawsuit relates to the allegedly materially false and misleading statements and or omissions that are the subject of the purported shareholder class action lawsuits 
the derivative lawsuit names zixcorp as a nominal defendant and as actual defendants the individuals named in the purported shareholder class action lawsuits mentioned above  as well as zixcorp s outside directors 
the suit seeks to require zixcorp to initiate legal action for unspecified damages against the individual defendants named in the purported shareholder class action lawsuits 
the suit also alleges breaches of fiduciary duty  abuse of control  insider selling and misappropriation of information and seeks contribution and indemnification against the individual defendants 
these lawsuits may require significant management time and attention and could result in significant legal expenses 
while we believe these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously  since these legal proceedings are in the preliminary stages we are unable to predict the scope or outcome of these matters and quantify their eventual impact  if any  on our company 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flow  and financial condition 
we maintain insurance that may limit our financial exposure for defense costs and liability for an unfavorable outcome  should we not prevail  for claims covered by the insurance coverage 
we may have to defend our rights in intellectual property that we use in our services  which could be disruptive and expensive to our business 
we may have to defend our intellectual property rights or defend against claims that we are infringing the rights of others 
intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive 
infringement claims could require us to develop non infringing products or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 
our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to develop or license the necessary technology 
furthermore  it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property  thus enabling them to effectively compete against us 
defects or errors in our services could harm our business 
we subject our zixcorp branded products solutions to quality assurance testing prior to release 
there is no assurance that the quality and assurance testing previously conducted by the businesses we acquired on their current products and services conform to our standards for quality assurance testing 
regardless of the level of quality assurance testing  any of our solutions could contain undetected defects or errors 
in particular  our pocketscript system is used to dispense prescription drugs 
defects or errors in our pocketscript system could result in inaccurate prescriptions being generated  which could result in injury or death to patients 
thus  undetected defects or errors could result in loss of or delay in revenues  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  litigation claims  increased insurance costs  or increased service and warranty costs 
any of these could prevent us from implementing our business model and achieving the revenues we need to operate profitably 
public key cryptography technology is subject to risks 
our zixcorp branded solutions  the pocketscript e prescribing service  and the mydoconline service employ  and future products and services may employ public key cryptography technology 
with public key cryptography technology  a public key and a private key are used to encrypt and decrypt messages 
the security afforded by this technology depends in large measure on the integrity of the private key  which is dependent  in part  on the application of certain 
table of contents mathematical principles 
the integrity of the private key is predicated on the assumption that it is difficult to mathematically derive the private key from the related public key 
should methods be developed that make it easier to derive the private key  the security of encryption products using public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated and such products could become unmarketable 
this could require us to make significant changes to our products  which could damage our reputation and otherwise hurt our business 
moreover  there have been public reports of the successful decryption of certain encrypted messages 
this  or related  publicity could adversely affect public perception of the security afforded by public key cryptography technology  which could harm our business 
we depend on key personnel 
we depend on the performance of our senior management team including our president  chief operating officer  and acting chief executive officer richard d 
spurr  and our vice president of finance and administration  chief financial officer and treasurer bradley c 
almond  and their direct reports and other key employees  particularly highly skilled technical personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain  and motivate these individuals 
there are no binding agreements with any of our employees that prevent them from leaving our company at any time 
there is competition for these personnel 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our failure to attract  retain  and motivate key employees could harm our business 
we could be affected by government regulation 
exports of software products using encryption technology  such as our zixcorp branded services  are generally restricted by the us government 
although we have obtained us government approval to export our solutions to almost all countries  the list of countries to which our solutions cannot be exported could be revised in the future 
furthermore  some countries impose restrictions on the use of encryption products such as ours 
failure to obtain the required governmental approvals would preclude the sale or use of our solutions in international markets 
furthermore  boards of pharmacy in the various states in which our pocketscript business operates regulate the process by which physicians write prescriptions 
while regulations in the states in which these businesses currently generally operate permit the electronic writing of prescriptions  such regulations could be revised in the future 
moreover  regulations in states in which these businesses do not currently operate may not be as favorable and may impede our ability to develop business in these states 
furthermore  future state or federal regulation could mandate standards for the electronic writing of prescriptions or for the secure electronic transmittal of personal health information through the internet that our technology and systems do not comply with  which would require us to modify our technology and systems 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
our stock price may decrease as a result of the dilutive effect caused by the additional number of shares that may become available in the market due to the issuances of our common stock in connection with the capital funding and acquisition transactions we completed over the last year 
as of march   there was a short position in our common stock of  our directors and executive officers own a substantial percentage of our securities 
their ownership could enable them to exercise significant control over corporate decisions and to implement corporate acts that are not in the best interests of our shareholders as a group 
our directors and executive officers beneficially own shares of our securities that represent approximately measured as of february  of the combined voting power eligible to vote on matters brought before our shareholders  including securities and associated warrants beneficially owned by antonio r 
sanchez  jr  a former director and father of a current director antonio r 
sanchez  iii  and current beneficial owner of approximately measured as of february  of our outstanding common stock  and john a 
ryan  our chairman 
therefore  our directors and executive officers  if they acted together  could exert substantial influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders 
these matters would include the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership and voting power may discourage or prevent someone from acquiring our business 
one investor owns a large percentage of our outstanding stock and could significantly influence the outcome of actions 
george w 
haywood and an ira for the benefit of mr 
haywood beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock measured as of the date of this filing without giving 
table of contents effect to the potential issuance of our common stock pursuant to the notes and the warrants held by amulet limited  omicron master trust  and rodman renshaw  llc 
therefore  mr 
haywood could exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors 
mr 
haywood s interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders 
this concentration of ownership and voting power may discourage or prevent someone from acquiring our business 
we have a substantial amount of debt and may be unable to service or refinance this debt or servicing this debt may restrict cash available for our business operations 
after giving effect to the issuance of the convertible promissory notes payable in november and the use of proceeds therefore  our total outstanding indebtedness will be approximately  this high level of debt could have negative consequences 
for example  it could result in our inability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the notes  which among other things  require us to maintain specified cash levels and limit our ability to incur debt and sell assets  which could  in turn  result in an event of default that if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on our operations  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal payments on our debt or to meet required cash reserves  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for working capital  capital investments  and other business activities  increase our vulnerability to adverse industry and general economic conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital investments  and other business activities  limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms that are commercially reasonable or at all  and limit our flexibility to plan for  and react to  changes in our business and our industry 
we have a significant amount of convertible securities  including the convertible promissory notes payable the notes and the warrants  outstanding and may issue additional equity securities in the future 
conversion or redemption of the notes into our common stock  exercise of the warrants and issuance or conversion of other securities will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders 
the notes issued in november may be converted by the note holders at an initial conversion price of per share 
if fully converted at this price  we would be obligated to issue an additional  shares of our common stock 
on march   we agreed to restructure the notes and agreed to redeem  of the notes at of par with cash or shares of our common stock by july  and an additional  of the notes at of par with cash or shares of our common stock by december  at a redemption rate that will require that we issue shares of our common stock valued at a discount to the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock for a specified number of trading days preceding the applicable redemption date 
the note holders also have the right to demand redemption of the entire principal amount of the notes at of par under certain circumstances 
in addition  we have the option to pay accrued interest on the notes using our common stock shares  valued at a discount to the volume weighted average price for the common stock for a specified number of trading days preceding the interest payment date 
we have also issued warrants covering  shares of our common stock to the holders of the notes  and additional warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were issued to the broker of the debt transaction 
the issuances of these shares of common stock in respect of the notes and the warrants would result in a substantial dilution of our stockholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or redemption of the notes or exercise of the warrants could materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  at some point in the future we may determine to seek additional capital funding or to acquire additional businesses 
these events could involve the issuance of one or more types of equity securities  including debt convertible into equity  common and convertible preferred stock  warrants to acquire common or preferred stock or any combination thereof 
such equity securities could be issued at or below the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
in addition  we incent our employees and attract new employees 
table of contents by issuing shares of our common stock and options to purchase shares of our common stock 
the interest of our existing stockholders may be diluted by any equity securities issued in capital funding financings an or business acquisitions and would be diluted by any such future share issuances and stock option grants to employees 
we may have liability for indemnification claims arising from the sale of our web inspector and message inspector product lines 
we disposed of web inspector and message inspector product line on march  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in selling those products  we agreed to provide customary indemnification to the purchasers of those businesses for breaches of representations and warranties  covenants  and other specified matters 
indemnification claims could be asserted against us with respect to these matters 
we may encounter other unanticipated risks and uncertainties in the markets we serve or in developing new products and services  and we cannot assure that we will be successful in responding to any unanticipated risks or uncertainties 
there are no assurances that we will be successful or that we will not encounter other  and even unanticipated  risks 
we discuss other operating  financial or legal risks or uncertainties in our periodic filings with the sec 
we are  of course  also subject to general economic risks

our future financial condition and results of operations  as well as any forward looking statements  are subject to change and to inherent risks and uncertainties  such as those disclosed in this document 
we do not intend  and undertake no obligation  to update any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not believe that it faces material market risk with respect to its cash  marketable securities and restricted cash investments  which totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
cash investments and marketable securities consist primarily of daily money market funds and high quality municipal bonds that possess extended maturity dates  but short term optional redemption dates and a day interest rate reset provision 
these investments do not include derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments as such terms are defined by the sec in applicable regulations 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any interest rate market risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not materially impact the company s operating results or cash flows due to the short term  high credit quality nature of the company s cash investments and marketable securities
