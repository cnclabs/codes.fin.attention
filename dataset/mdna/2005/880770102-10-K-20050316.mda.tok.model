 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  teradyne implemented the sec s sab guidelines  retroactive to the beginning of the year 
this was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on prior years resulted in a charge to income of million net of income taxes of million or per diluted share which has been included in income for the fiscal year ended december  for the fiscal year ended december   teradyne recognized million in revenue that is included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of january item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the historical information contained in this document  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  made pursuant to section e of the securities exchange act of  that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of teradyne s plans  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form k 
teradyne s actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements 
factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in certain factors that may affect future results and elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates teradyne has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect its reported and expected financial results 
preparation of financial statements and use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  investments  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  bad debts  income taxes  pensions  warranties  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition in accordance with the guidance provided by the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of loss have passed  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally pass to teradyne s customers upon shipment 
in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination  acceptance or cash payment  teradyne defers revenue recognition until such events occur 
for equipment that includes hardware and software that is incidental to the product  revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
certain contracts require teradyne to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications  which are generally conducted prior to shipment 
where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  or in the case of new products  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 
for multiple element arrangements  teradyne defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price which is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered 
for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit  the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in the control of teradyne 
teradyne also defers the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance  which represents deferred profit 
fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
teradyne s post shipment obligations include installation  training services  one year standard warranties  and extended warranties 
installation does not alter the product capabilities  does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors 
installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter 
training services are optional and do not affect the customer s ability to use the product 
teradyne defers revenue for the fair value of installation and training 
extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and teradyne defers revenue in accordance with fasb technical bulletin teradyne s products are generally subject to warranty and related costs are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized 
teradyne classifies shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue 
service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
connection systems revenue is generally recognized upon shipment according to the shipping terms of the arrangement as there is no installation required and there are no contractual acceptance requirements 
teradyne does not provide its customers with contractual rights of return for any of its products 
for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product  revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
teradyne recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements  revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists for such elements 
in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement  all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered 
vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 
for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under sop no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs 
these arrangements require significant production  modification or customization 
in all cases  changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
with respect to contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured  generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 
inventories inventories  which include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value 
teradyne records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such a writedown is identified through the quarterly review process 
the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses 
stock option and stock purchase plans teradyne accounts for its director and employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
teradyne s employee stock purchase plan is a non compensatory plan 
teradyne s stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of apb accordingly  there have been no charges for employee or director stock options or employee stock purchase plans 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid in capital 
teradyne makes pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method was followed under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
see note b accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for pro forma stock option and stock purchase plan information 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r 
in interim or annual periods beginning after june   sfas r would eliminate the ability to account for equity based compensation using the intrinsic value based method under apb sfas r requires companies to calculate equity based compensation expense for stock compensation awards based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant 
under sfas r  equity based compensation is required to be recognized in companies financial statements 
teradyne expects to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of  as required 
for the years ended december   and  had sfas r been effective  teradyne would have recognized additional non cash equity based compensation expense of million  million  and million  respectively  applying the provisions of sfas income taxes on a quarterly basis  teradyne evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance 
as a result of its review undertaken at december   teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance 
due to the continued uncertainty of realization  teradyne maintained its valuation allowance at december  and teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence  including sustained profitability  exists that realization is more likely than not 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets teradyne assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors teradyne considers important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of teradyne s use of the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when teradyne determines that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  teradyne measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks 
teradyne assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the volatility of the industries that teradyne serves can cause certain of its customers to experience shortages of cash flows  which can impact their ability to make required payments 
teradyne maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed periodically taking into account the customer s current payment history  the customer s current financial statements and other information regarding the customer s credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of teradyne s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered

semiconductor test systems bookings within the soc market showed a continuation of the growth in asian markets from into  mainly related to subcons in taiwan and singapore 
over  teradyne saw a rise in bookings driven primarily by semiconductor testing needs in the wireless  broadband  consumer electronics  and mass storage datacom markets  which are serviced by the j  catalyst and flex products  and whose chips are sold mainly by european and us semiconductor companies 
many of these chips are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcons in many parts of asia  but concentrated in taiwan and singapore 
the economic downturn which prevailed in past years has pushed companies to lower fixed costs 
as a result  an increasing trend by chip makers has been to outsource non core competency testing needs to subcons in low cost regions 
as total semiconductor test systems bookings have grown  the bookings from subcons have continued to make up a large percentage of total orders 
bookings from subcons increased to million in from million in  and made up of bookings in compared to in semiconductor test systems backlog increased from to primarily due to increased orders from subcons and foundries located in the asian markets 
the growth in connection systems orders from to was a result of continued spending for wireless network deployments in the united states and europe as well as an increase in network spending for both the enterprise and service provider markets 
the computer server market was also strong 
bookings were up appreciably for connection systems vhdm hsd backplane interconnect product lines as well as the nexlev family of high speed  high density mezzanine connectors 
similar to  the growth in orders was partially offset by a decline in orders due to the decision to exit a portion of connection systems lower margin ems product line 
the increase in connection systems bookings from to was due in part to a decrease in cancellations in  as well as an increase in demand in the telecommunications market  driven by wireless network deployments  which increased for both us and european telecommunications equipment providers in the latter part of the fourth quarter of compared to the first half of orders in the assembly test systems segment increased from to  primarily driven by increases in the mil aero business and increased sales of in circuit products 
the growth in these areas was offset by a decline in orders resulting from the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual x ray and rework product lines in the net decrease in assembly test systems orders from to is due primarily to the sale of the manufacturing software and the manual x ray and rework product lines 
this decrease was offset by a increase in orders by government agencies and contractors in the mil aero business  which had a twofold increase in orders from the first half to the second half of teradyne s cancellations for its four reportable segments for the last three years are as follows in millions semiconductor test systems connection systems assembly test systems other test systems semiconductor test systems experienced million of cancellations and backlog adjustments in approximately of this amount was related to cancellations  while the remainder was a backlog adjustment related to management s estimate of what may be canceled in future periods 
the connection systems cancellations in were from major customers in the telecommunications and networking infrastructure industries  due principally to product program cancellations 
teradyne s net bookings by region as a percentage of total net bookings are as follows united states south east asia europe taiwan singapore japan rest of the world for the past three years  teradyne s backlog of unfilled orders for its four reportable segments is as follows in millions semiconductor test systems connection systems assembly test systems other test systems customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice  subject to possible cancellation penalties 
in   and there were no significant cancellation penalties received 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellation of orders  teradyne s backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period 
delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on teradyne s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
revenue teradyne s net revenue for its four reportable segments for  and is as follows percent change percent change in millions except percent change semiconductor test systems connection systems assembly test systems other test systems the increase in semiconductor test systems sales from to is attributable to growth in the overall soc test market  and a share gain by semiconductor test systems in that market 
the worldwide market for semiconductor test equipment excluding memory testers grew by approximately in semiconductor test system s share in that market grew from to much of the increased sales for semiconductor test systems came from subcon customers for use in their asian facilities  primarily in singapore and taiwan 
the revenue derived from subcons was driven by higher demand from their mixed signal soc customers  led by sales of catalyst and flex systems 
as is described in the bookings section  semiconductor test systems has seen growth in revenue from to due to increased need for testing in the wireless  broadband  and to a lesser extent  mass storage datacom sectors 
sales of the j product were also relatively strong in  serving the microcontroller and high volume logic customer segments 
similar to the increase in sales from to  the increase from to was attributable to increased demand from subcons located in the asian markets  particularly  singapore  taiwan  and malaysia 
connection systems sales in increased to million led by stronger customer demand for connection systems high speed  high density interconnect products  which more than offset the decrease in sales associated with the exiting of the lower margin ems business in connection systems sales declined from to primarily as a result of the decision to exit the lower margin ems business 
the segment saw downward pricing pressure throughout the past three years 
the increase in assembly test systems sales from to was due to increases in both the commercial and mil aero businesses 
commercial business growth was due to increased sales of in circuit test products  while the increase in mil aero sales was generated by a number of large projects which were undertaken in these increases were offset  in part  by decreases from the sale of the manual x ray  rework and aoi product lines in from through  the commercial business saw decreases in revenue  particularly due to the sale of product lines referenced above  while mil aero revenue increased slightly year over year 
teradyne s four reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated net revenue for each of the last three years semiconductor test systems connection systems assembly test systems other test systems teradyne s net revenue by region as a percentage of total revenue is as follows united states europe south east asia singapore taiwan japan rest of the world teradyne s product and service revenue breakout for the past three years is as follows percent change percent change in millions except percent change product revenue service revenue service revenue is derived from the servicing of teradyne s installed base of products and includes maintenance contracts  repairs  extended warranties  parts sales and applications support 
in the past three years  no single customer accounted for more than of consolidated net revenue 
in   and  teradyne s three largest customers in the aggregate accounted for  and of consolidated net revenue  respectively 
gross margin point change point change dollars in millions gross margin percent of total revenue the gross margin improvement from to was the result of several factors 
an improvement of points is credited to an increase in sales volumes and a shift in the mix of revenues  with higher semiconductor test systems content which has higher incremental margins 
the remainder is attributable to lower material costs and a reduction in fixed manufacturing costs  including depreciation and facility costs resulting from past restructuring actions 
teradyne s gross margin improvement from to was impacted by a variety of factors  including an improvement of points related to reduced manufacturing costs and increased volume levels  and an improvement of points related to an increase in volume and a shift in product mix 
inventory provisions decreased from million in to million in  which contributed a point gross margin improvement 
the breakout of product and service gross margin is as follows point change point change dollars in millions product gross margin percent of product revenue point change point change dollars in millions service gross margin percent of service revenue teradyne assesses the carrying value of its inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions 
forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand 
this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory 
obsolete inventory  which represents items for which there is no demand  is fully reserved 
excess inventory  which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed  is written down to estimated net realizable value 
these write offs and write downs consist of raw materials and components 
sales of previously reserved inventory items result in recovery of the related inventory provision which is recorded in cost of revenues 
during the year ended december   teradyne recorded excess and obsolete provisions in cost of revenues of million and million  respectively 
of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded  million related to semiconductor test systems  million related to assembly test systems  million related to connection systems and million related to other test systems 
during the year ended december   teradyne recorded excess and obsolete provisions in cost of revenues of million and million  respectively 
of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded  million related to assembly test systems which included million relating to the discontinuance of manufacturing  distributing and primary support of the aoi product line and million related to semiconductor test systems soc parts and components 
during the year ended december   teradyne recorded excess and obsolete provisions in cost of revenues of million and million  respectively 
of the million of total excess and obsolete provisions recorded  million related to semiconductor test systems  including million of memory test inventory related to probe one and j product line discontinuances 
the probe one and j inventory had been fully written off as of december  there is no material exposure remaining for the probe one or j products 
during the years ended december  and  teradyne sold inventory that was previously reserved for which had a gross margin impact of million and million  respectively 
teradyne scrapped million  million  and million of inventory which had been previously written down or written off during the years ended december   and  respectively 
teradyne has no set timeline for scrapping the remaining inventory 
as of december  and  teradyne had inventory reserves for amounts which have been written down or written off of million and million  respectively 
of the reserves at december   million  million  million  and million relate to inventory provisions recorded in    and prior to  respectively

engineering and development change change dollars in millions engineering and development percent of total revenue during  teradyne maintained its commitment to sustained levels of investment in research through continued engineering and development spending 
more than two thirds of teradyne s total engineering and development expenses are incurred by the semiconductor test systems segment  where a new test platform requires up to three years for development and costs between million 
during and  semiconductor test systems reduced the number of platforms under major development  which increased the resources for continued engineering on selective platforms 
the consolidation of multiple product divisions within semiconductor test systems into one group has enabled more leverage and reuse for application specific integrated circuits development and instrumentation 
the increase of million in engineering and development spending from to consists of the following amounts million increase due to variable employee compensation  million increase in prototype material for engineering development projects  million increase in outsourced project engineering  and million increase in travel and training costs  these increases were offset in part by the following million decrease in salaries and fringe benefits due to a decrease in headcount  offset by salary increases effective july   and million decrease in depreciation and facility costs as a result of facility closures and lower capital spending  including a decrease of million in accelerated depreciation related to asset writedowns and facility closures in the reduction in engineering and development expenses from to resulted primarily from the exiting of product lines within semiconductor test systems and assembly test systems 
the elimination of memory test within the semiconductor test systems segment resulted in a reduction of million in engineering expenses from to in addition  semiconductor test systems consolidated engineering facilities  outsourced certain software engineering development to a low cost region and limited the amount of engineering work done by outside consultants in an effort to reduce costs 
as a result of the sale in assembly test systems of its manufacturing software product line and manual x ray inspection and rework product line as well as the discontinuance of the automated optical inspection products  engineering expenses from to decreased by approximately million 
the decrease from to in engineering and development spending resulting from the discontinuance of product lines and actions taken to reduce costs consists of the following amounts million as a result of a workforce reduction  partially offset by a million increase from the elimination of company wide paycuts and the granting of previously frozen salary increases in the third quarter of  million from a reduction in outsourced contract engineering  million from a decrease in depreciation as a result of the recent writedown of assets  as well as the trend to rent or lease  rather than purchase  development tools  and million from reduced office and facility costs 
selling and administrative change change dollars in millions selling and administrative percent of total revenue the increase in spending of million from to was principally due to the following approximate amounts million increase due to variable employee compensation  million from an increase in consulting expenses  and million increase in travel and training costs  these increases were offset in part by the following million in lower depreciation costs due to asset writedowns and capital spending cutbacks  and million decrease in rental and lease payments due to increased sublease income and facilities consolidation 
the decrease in spending from to was principally due to the following approximate amounts million as a result of a workforce reduction  partially offset by a million increase from the elimination of company wide paycuts and the granting of previously frozen salary increases  million in reduced utility costs from the consolidation of facilities  lower promotional spending and travel cutbacks  million from a decrease in consulting spending and legal fees  and million in lower depreciation due to the writedown of assets 
restructuring and other charges the tables below represent activity related to restructuring charges for the years ended december    and the accrual for severance and benefits is reflected in accrued employees compensation and withholdings 
the accrual for lease payments on vacated facilities is reflected in other accrued liabilities and other long term accrued liabilities and is expected to be paid out over the lease terms  the latest of which expires in teradyne expects to pay out approximately million against the lease accruals over the next twelve months

there were approximately  employees terminated across teradyne during the year ended december  for further details on teradyne s restructuring and other charges during  and see note l restructuring and other charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  teradyne committed to a restructuring plan the plan as part of an ongoing effort to lower expenses 
pursuant to the plan  teradyne believes that it will incur costs for severance and related employee benefits  impairment charges and remaining lease obligations related to a vacated facility  and other charges 
the total charges expected to be incurred under the plan are million 
the actions taken in accordance with the plan are expected to generate cost savings of approximately million annually  primarily in the connection systems and assembly test segments 
through march   teradyne has incurred charges of approximately million  related to severance and related employee benefits  remaining lease obligations and related asset impairments  and other charges 
goodwill impairment unless conditions dictate otherwise  teradyne s annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
teradyne tested the assembly test systems and connection systems reporting units  for impairment during its annual test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in either reporting unit as of december  and during the quarter ended september   teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue  bookings and profit for the fiscal years through from the previous quarter s forecast for the assembly test systems segment and reduced its workforce by employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook 
as a result  teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the assembly test systems segment as of september  teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the assembly test systems segment did not exceed its fair value and thus no impairment charge was recorded 
the fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
during the quarter ended september   as a result of contraction in the assembly test systems market to its lowest level in a decade as evidenced by various market reports available to teradyne  teradyne decreased its forecasted revenue  bookings and profit for fiscal years through from the previous quarter s forecast for the assembly test systems segment and reduced its workforce by employees to appropriately size the segment given the revised business outlook 
as a result  teradyne performed an interim impairment test for the goodwill related to the assembly test systems segment as of september  teradyne concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the assembly test systems segment exceeded its fair value and recognized a million goodwill impairment charge recorded in goodwill impairment in the consolidated statements of operations 
the impairment charge was measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the assembly test systems segment to its carrying value 
the fair value of the segment was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
interest income and expense change change in millions interest income interest expense the increase in interest income from to was due primarily to an increase in interest rates in the latter half of and increased cash balances throughout the decrease in interest income from to was attributable to lower cash balances and lower interest rates 
the decrease in interest expense from to and from to was primarily attributable to the prepayment of teradyne s california mortgage of million in the third quarter of which reduced interest expense for the fourth quarter of and all of  as well as the repurchase of million of teradyne s convertible notes in the third quarter of other income and expense  net other income and expense  net for the years ended december    and includes the following income expense in thousands gain on sale of investment collection of loan other than temporary impairment of common stock investment fair value adjustment on warrants mortgage prepayment penalty other than temporary impairment of investment writedown of investment in an engineering service provider total gain on sale of an investment in common stock 
the loan had previously been valued at zero due to its uncertainty of collection 
penalties related to prepayment of a million mortgage loan collateralized against certain california real estate properties  which was to mature on january  income loss before income taxes change change in millions semiconductor test systems connection systems assembly test systems other test systems corporate total the change to an income position from a loss position from to was mainly attributable to increased sales in the semiconductor  connector and assembly test systems segments  as well as continued cost reductions throughout the company 
the decrease in the loss before income taxes from to in semiconductor test systems  connection systems  and assembly test systems was primarily due to cost reduction actions in the respective segments and market conditions during the year

tax expense for also included an irs settlement related to the closing out of tax years through during  teradyne utilized previously reserved net operating losses to reduce taxable income and lower the effective tax rate 
teradyne did not record an income tax benefit against the loss incurred in until sufficient positive evidence exists  including an appropriate level of profitability  teradyne will not record tax benefits on operating losses in future results of operations 
due to the continued uncertainty of realization  teradyne maintained its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december  and teradyne does not expect to significantly reduce its valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence  including sustained profitability  exists that realization is more likely than not 
the effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
for the year ended december   teradyne recorded a tax provision of million resulting in a tax rate of 
the tax rate of is primarily due to the recording of a provision for income taxes to establish a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  teradyne recorded a tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
the evidence that teradyne reviewed during the fourth quarter of included actual revenues and net loss for the fiscal year compared to earlier teradyne forecasts  the inability to get to break even during despite implementing several restructuring programs  and a reduction in revenues and an increase in the loss forecasted for the fiscal year as a result of its review undertaken at december   teradyne concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized 
contractual obligations the following table reflects teradyne s contractual obligations as of december  purchase obligations non cancelable lease commitments interest on debt convertible senior notes pension funding notes payable other debt total in thousands beyond total minimum payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease income of million due in the future under non cancelable subleases

the inventory  accounts payable  deferred revenue and accrual balances were partially offset by a decrease of million in the accounts receivable balances primarily due to an decrease in days sales outstanding  based on annualized fourth quarter net revenues  from days in to days in changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of million in primarily due to a decrease in inventory balances of million across all segments 
changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of million in primarily due to a decrease in inventory balances across all segments and the receipt of a tax refund in march of investing activities consist of purchases  sales and maturities of marketable securities  proceeds from the sale of businesses  proceeds from asset disposals  proceeds from the sale of product lines  cash paid for assets and purchases of capital assets 
capital expenditures increased by million in compared to additions of internally constructed systems for use in marketing and engineering activities in the semiconductor test systems segment accounted for approximately million of the increase in capital expenditures due to the recent introduction of the flex platform 
the remainder of the increase was attributable to purchases of manufacturing and engineering equipment across teradyne to support the increase in revenues in and continued investment in research and development 
capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in financing activities include sales of teradyne s common stock  as well as repayments of debt 
during and  repayments of long term debt used cash of million and million  respectively as teradyne repurchased a portion of its outstanding convertible senior notes in the third quarter of  and prepaid its mortgage on its california properties in the third quarter of during  and  issuances of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans generated million  million  and million  respectively 
on october   teradyne issued million principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes in a private placement and received net proceeds of million 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a rate which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
teradyne began making annual interest payments of million  paid semi annually  on the notes commencing on april  the notes are senior unsecured obligations of teradyne that rank equally with teradyne s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
in the event of a change in control by which teradyne merges with or sells substantially all of its assets to a third party  the holders of the notes may be able to require teradyne to redeem some or all of the notes either in discounted teradyne common stock or in cash 
on february   the securities and exchange commission declared effective a registration statement on form s covering both the notes and the shares of common stock into which they can be converted 
on or after october   teradyne may redeem the notes in whole or in part at the prices set forth below 
the redemption price  expressed as a percentage of principal amount  is as follows for the designated periods period redemption price beginning on october  and ending on october  beginning on october  and ending on october  and thereafter equal to of the principal amount 
the board of directors of teradyne has authorized management to repurchase up to million of the outstanding notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below 
in the third quarter of and the first quarter of  teradyne repurchased million and million of the notes  respectively 
the decision to repurchase a portion of the notes was based on the fair market value of the notes being below the redemption price during the period 
currently  management intends to repurchase the notes on the open market through negotiated transactions when management believes that such price is beneficial to teradyne 
there are a number of factors that will affect the timing of when and the amount of the notes that management may elect to repurchase  including the price of the available notes  teradyne s stock price  teradyne s available cash and marketable securities  prevailing interest rates  and teradyne s anticipated liquidity needs 
if  at some point in the future  teradyne s stock price is greater than the conversion price of approximately per share  management may elect to convert a portion of the notes into equity  to avoid the continuation of interest payments and to conserve capital 
however  there can be no assurance that even if teradyne s stock price is above the conversion price upon the notice of redemption that the notes will convert into equity as teradyne s stock price may drop between the redemption notification date and the actual redemption date 
if this were to occur  teradyne would be forced to redeem the portion of the notes called into cash 
there are a number of factors that will affect the timing and amount that management may elect to redeem including teradyne s stock price  teradyne s available cash and marketable securities and teradyne s anticipated liquidity needs 
teradyne believes its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of million will be sufficient to meet working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
teradyne plans to contribute approximately million in to teradyne s us qualified pension plan which is currently under funded 
inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
retirement plans teradyne s pension expense  which includes the us qualified pension plan  certain qualified plans for non us subsidiaries and a supplemental executive defined benefit plan  was approximately million for the year ended december   which was of teradyne s cost of revenue and operating expenses 
the largest portion of teradyne s pension expense was million for its us qualified pension plan  which is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected return on plan assets for teradyne s us qualified pension plan assets of 
in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption  teradyne evaluated input from its investment manager and pension consultants  including their review of asset class return expectations 
teradyne also considered its historical year compounded return of for the period ending december   which has been in excess of the broad equity and bond benchmark indices 
based on these historical returns  teradyne believes that was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal teradyne will continue to evaluate its expected return on plan assets at least annually  and will adjust these returns as necessary 
the current asset allocation for teradyne s us qualified pension plan is invested in equity securities and invested in fixed income securities  which is in accordance with the plan s asset allocation requirements 
teradyne s actual asset allocation as of december  was virtually identical to its asset allocation model 
teradyne s investment manager regularly reviews teradyne s actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with teradyne s targeted allocations 
teradyne bases its determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized 
as of december  in the us qualified pension plan teradyne had cumulative losses of approximately million  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the discount rate that teradyne utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on the citigroup pension liability index formerly salomon brothers pension liability index  which was at at december   down from at december  as a result  teradyne selected for its december  discount rate  which was down from as of december  each year teradyne considers the citigroup pension liability index  along with other indices including the moody s aa rated corporate bond yield and the citigroup year aaa aa rate 
teradyne estimates that its pension expense for the us qualified pension plan will be approximately million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the pension expense estimates are based on a discount rate 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in teradyne s pension plans 
teradyne performed a sensitivity analysis  which expresses the estimated us qualified pension plan pension expense that would have resulted for the year ended december   if teradyne changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 
discount rate return on plan assets in millions teradyne s funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible 
the assets of these plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities 
the value of teradyne s us qualified pension plan assets has increased from million at december  to million at december  the investment performance returns and teradyne contributions have decreased the deficit of teradyne s us qualified pension plan  net of benefit obligations  from million at december  to million at december  during  teradyne contributed million to the us qualified pension plan 
teradyne plans to contribute approximately million in to this plan

certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information we provide  statements made by our employees or information included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k contain statements that are not purely historical  but are forward looking statements  made under section e of the securities exchange act of  which involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  forward looking statements made herein include projections  plans and objectives for our business  financial condition  operating results  future operations  or future economic performance  statements relating to the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital requirements  capital expenditures  expectations as to customer orders and demand for our products and statements relating to backlog  bookings and cancellations  gross margins and pricing considerations 
these statements are neither promises nor guarantees but involve risks and uncertainties  both known and unknown  which could cause our actual future results to differ materially from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
our business is impacted by worldwide economic cycles  which are difficult to predict 
capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries  such as teradyne  have  in the past  been negatively impacted by sudden slowdowns in the global economies  and resulting reductions in customer capital investments 
future slowdowns in global economies and reductions in customer capital investments  which may adversely impact our business  are difficult to predict 
acts of war  terrorists attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks may adversely impact our business 
acts of war and terrorists attacks may cause damage or disruption to our employees  facilities  customers  suppliers and distributors which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation or financial condition 
as we sell and manufacture products both in the united states and internationally  the threat of future terrorist attacks could lead to changes in security and operations at those locations which could increase our operating costs and which may adversely affect our business 
such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems 
all of these conditions make it difficult for us  and our customers  to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for electronics  which historically have been highly cyclical 
our business and results of operations depend in significant part upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products 
the market demand for electronics is impacted by economic slowdowns and the effects of hostile acts 
historically  the electronics and semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply  which often have had a severe negative effect on demand for test equipment  including systems we manufacture and market 
we believe that the markets for newer generations of electronic products such as those that we manufacture and market will also be subject to similar fluctuations 
we are dependent on the timing of orders from our customers and the deferral or cancellation of previous customer orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot assure that the level of revenues or new orders for a calendar quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters 
in addition  any factor adversely affecting the electronics industry or particular segments within the electronics industry may adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we have taken measures to address the slowdown in the market for our products which could have long term negative effects on our business 
during    and  we took measures to address slowdowns in the market for our products 
in particular  we reduced our workforce  closed and or sold facilities  discontinued certain product lines  implemented material cost reduction programs and reduced planned capital expenditures and expense budgets 
each measure we took to address such slowdowns could have long term negative effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  increasing our debt  and making it more difficult to respond to customers or competitors  as the market and customer orders turn around 
we may not be able to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand 
because we took measures in recent years to scale back operations and reduce expenses in response to decreased customer demand for products and services  we may not be able to satisfy a rapid increase in customer demand 
our ability to meet rapid increases in customer demand is also  to a certain extent  dependant upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to meet increased product or delivery requirements  over which we have little or no control 
our business may be adversely impacted by acquisitions which may affect our ability to manage and maintain our business 
since our inception  we have acquired a number of businesses 
in the future  we may undertake additional acquisitions of businesses that complement our existing operations 
such past or future acquisitions could involve a number of risks  including the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel  the costs associated with and or the inability to effectively integrate an acquired business into our culture  product and service delivery methodology and other standards  controls  procedures and policies  the inability to retain the management  key personnel and other employees of an acquired business  the inability to retain the customers of an acquired business  the possibility that our reputation will be adversely affected by customer satisfaction problems of an acquired business  potential known or unknown liabilities associated with an acquired business  including but not limited to regulatory  environmental and tax liabilities  significant underperformance of the acquired business relative to our expectations  the amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles  which may adversely affect our reported results of operations  and litigation which has or which may arise in the future in connection with such acquisitions 
for example  in connection with the august acquisition of each of herco technology corp  a california company  and perception laminates  inc  a california company  a complaint was filed on or about september  and is now pending in federal district court  san diego  california  by the former owners of those companies naming as defendants teradyne and two of our executive officers 
this case is further described in part i  item legal proceedings in this form k 
additionally  in  we were designated as a potentially responsible party prp at a clean up site in los angeles  california 
this claim arises out of our acquisition of perception laminates  inc in august prior to that date  perception laminates had itself acquired certain assets of alco industries inc under an asset purchase agreement dated july  this matter is further described in part i  item legal proceedings in this form k 
we currently are and in the future may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business 
from time to time  we may be subject to litigation or other administrative and governmental proceedings that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and  in the event of an adverse decision  pay damages in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
for example  on april   hampshire equity partners ii  lp hep  filed a complaint against teradyne and teradyne connection systems segment tcs asserting fraud and negligence based claims  and a claim for intentional interference with economic opportunity 
in the complaint  hep alleges that it relied upon statements made by a representative of tcs to a hep agent during its due diligence prior to investing million in connector services corporation  aka amax plating  inc csc 
hep seeks to hold teradyne and tcs responsible for its decision to invest in csc and for the losses it has suffered upon the bankruptcy of csc 
hep seeks damages in an unstated amount exceeding million 
the case is currently pending in the us district court of the southern district of new york 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims and will defend ourselves vigorously 
management does not believe that the outcomes of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
this case is further described in part i  item legal proceedings in this form k 
our business may be adversely impacted by divestitures of lines of business which may affect our ability to manage and maintain our business 
since our inception  we have divested certain lines of business 
in the future  we may undertake additional such divestitures 
such past or future divestitures could involve a number of risks  including the diversion of the attention of management and other key personnel  disruptions and other effects caused by the divestiture of a line of business on our culture  product and service delivery methodology and other standards  controls  procedures and policies  customer satisfaction problems caused by the loss of a divested line of business  restructuring  inventory and other charges which may affect our results of operations  and the decreased diversification of our product lines caused by the divestiture of a line of business which may make our operating results subject to increased market fluctuations 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights 
our products incorporate technology that we protect in several ways  including patents  copyrights  trade secrets and by contract ip 
however  even with these protections  our ip may still be challenged  invalidated or subject to other infringement actions 
while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate  no single element of our ip is in itself essential 
if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective  our business could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others 
an assertion of patent infringement against us  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products  or require a significant use of management resources and necessitate a lengthy and expensive defense which could adversely affect our operating results 
if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products  our revenues will be adversely affected 
we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers 
in a rapidly evolving market  such as ours  the development of new technologies  commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success 
successful product development and introduction depends upon a number of factors  including new product selection  ability to meet customer requirements  development of competitive products by competitors  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing  and assembly processes and product performance at customer locations 
we are subject to intense competition 
we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments 
some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
we also face competition from internal suppliers at several of our customers 
some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics 
new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products 
moreover  increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to risks of operating internationally 
a significant portion of our total revenue is derived from customers outside the united states 
our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets  changes in tariffs and exchange rates  social  political and economic instability  acts of terrorism and international conflicts  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  cultural differences in the conduct of business  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  and compliance with customs regulations 
in addition  an increasingly large portion of our products are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations  including china  and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan  singapore  china and other parts of asia 
as a result  we are subject to a number of economic and other risks  particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions 
disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business 
our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees 
competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry 
our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees 
the loss of one or more key or other employees  our inability to attract additional qualified employees  or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements  we could have reduced revenues and earnings 
certain components  including semiconductor chips  may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements 
approximately of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive 
if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products  we could lose time sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products  and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors  over whom we do not exercise any control 
we are also dependent on the financial strength of our suppliers and may be subject to litigation arising from our relationships with suppliers and others 
there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 
we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use  storage  discharge  site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
if we fail to comply with present and future regulations  or are required to perform site remediation  we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
present and future regulations may also restrict our ability to expand facilities  require us to acquire costly equipment  or require us to incur other significant costs and expenses 
pursuant to present regulations and agreements  we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in california  massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations 
as of december   we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the california  massachusetts and new hampshire sites 
on january   the european union adopted the following directives i the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the rohs directive  and ii the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive the weee directive 
both the rohs directive and the weee directive will alter the type and manner in which electronic equipment is imported  sold and handled in the european union 
ensuring compliance with the rohs directive and the weee directive and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus  could have a negative impact on the business  operations and financial condition 
the rohs directive and the weee directive will be become effective on july  and august   respectively 
we have substantially increased our indebtedness 
on october   we completed a private placement of million principal amount of convertible senior notes the notes due october  and received net proceeds of million 
as a result  we have incurred approximately million principal amount of additional indebtedness  substantially increasing our ratio of debt to total capitalization 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult to make payments on our debt and other obligations  make it difficult to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service for indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in our business and the industries in which we compete  place us at a possible competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
during the year ended december   and in the first quarter of  teradyne took steps to reduce its indebtedness  including repurchasing a total of million of the notes on the open market pursuant to the board of directors authorization given to management to repurchase up to million of the outstanding notes in open market purchases at negotiated prices below 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations  including our obligations under the notes 
we may not be able to satisfy certain obligations in the event of a change in control 
the indenture governing the notes contains provisions that apply to a change in control of teradyne 
if a change in control occurs  the holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase all of the notes not previously called for redemption 
the price that we are required to pay is of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased  together with interest accrued but unpaid to  but excluding  the repurchase date 
at our option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  instead of paying the repurchase price in cash  we may pay the repurchase price in common stock valued at of the average of the closing prices of common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding and including the third trading day prior to the repurchase date 
if we are required to repurchase the notes  there is no guarantee that we will have enough funds to pay such amounts 
as a result  a change in control could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations 
if our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or certain of our other obligations  we would be in default under the terms thereof  which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur 
any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial position and operating results 
in addition  we cannot assure that we would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the notes if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations 
moreover  we cannot assure that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity 
we may need additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain 
we expect that our existing cash and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
however  we have a finite amount of cash and in the event we may need to raise additional funds  due to losses or other reasons  we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
further  if we issue additional equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock 
future financings may place restrictions on how we operate our business 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  if and when needed  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities  grow our business or respond to competitive pressures  which could seriously harm our business 
we will be required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense  which will adversely affect our operating results there has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options 
we currently disclose pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually by calculating the grants fair value and disclosing the impact on net income loss and net income loss per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas r or any other future laws and regulations requiring us to record the fair value of all stock options as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations will adversely affect operating results 
note b accounting policies  of the consolidated financial statements reflects the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on net income loss and net income loss per share if it had been in effect during the year ended december  included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  are additional stock based compensation disclosures 
provisions of our charter and by laws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult 
our basic corporate documents  our stockholder rights plan and massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control  even if a change in control might be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 
our annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability 
the following factors set out below are expected to impact future operations competitive pressures on selling prices  our ability to introduce and the market acceptance of new products planned for and beyond  changes in product revenue mix resulting from changes in customer demand  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter resulting from the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase due to capital expenditure approvals and constraints occurring at the end of a quarter  or the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from a competitor seeking the business  engineering and development investments relating to new product introductions in and beyond  and the expansion of manufacturing and engineering operations in asia  the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet product quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products  especially if product demand increases rapidly  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory relating to the lack of demand for and the discontinuance of products  and impairment charges for certain long lived assets 
in particular  due to the introduction of a number of new  complex test systems in and and the planned introduction of other systems in and beyond  there can be no assurance that we will not experience delays in shipment of our products or that our products will achieve customer acceptance 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we have and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
we have significant guarantees and indemnification obligations from time to time we make guarantees to customers regarding the performance of our products  guarantee certain indebtedness obligations of our subsidiary companies and have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers  directors  employees and agents  to the extent permitted by law  arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer  director  employee or agent  is or was serving at our request in such capacity 
if we become liable under any of these obligations  it could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
for additional information regarding guarantees and indemnification obligations see part i  note j commitments and contingencies in this form k 
in addition to the guarantee and indemnification obligations set forth in this k  teradyne occasionally guarantees the performance obligations and responsibilities of its subsidiary and affiliate companies 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments  forward currency contracts and accounts receivable 
teradyne maintains cash investments primarily in us treasury and government agency securities and corporate debt securities  rated aa or higher  which have minimal credit risk 
teradyne places forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require collateral to secure accounts receivable 
exchange rate risk management teradyne regularly enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in european and japanese currencies 
these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year 
these contracts are used to reduce teradyne s risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
in addition  we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts 
the gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income 
teradyne does not engage in currency speculation 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of december  and  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk management teradyne is exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
the principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities 
debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages 
in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk  a fluctuation in interest rates was assumed 
since the notes were out of the money at year end  they were treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored 
market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
on these bases  the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is million and million as of december  and  respectively
