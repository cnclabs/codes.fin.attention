item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under 
summary of business considerations and certain factors that may affect future operating results and or stock price on page overview applied signal technology  inc provides advanced digital signal processing products  systems  and services used in reconnaissance of telecommunications signals for intelligence gathering  a process referred to as signal intelligence 
our primary customer is the united states government 
signal reconnaissance systems are comprised of collection and processing equipment 
signal collection equipment consists of sophisticated receivers that scan through potentially thousands of cellular telephone  microwave  ship to shore  global communication network  and military transmissions in the radio frequency rf spectrum with the goal of collecting certain specific signals 
our signal processing equipment uses advanced software and hardware to evaluate characteristics of the collected signals and selects those most likely to contain relevant information 
at inception in  we focused our efforts primarily on processing equipment 
over time  we have broadened our scope to add specialized collection equipment and complete signal processing systems  and related services 
our revenues are primarily generated from sales of our products and services to two agencies of the united states government 
our contracts can be divided into two major types fixed price and cost reimbursement 
fixed price contracts are typically characterized by negotiated prices for efforts that involve little or no development risk 
cost risks associated with building and delivering products under fixed price contracts are borne solely by the contractor 
cost reimbursement types of contracts are characterized by negotiated target costs and fees  and are generally associated with engineering development work where there is a high degree of risk and uncertainty 
although risks associated with cost reimbursement contracts are borne by the customer  we cannot exceed contract ceilings without the approval of our customer 
the following table represents the revenue concentration by contract type fy fy fy cost reimbursement contracts fixed price contracts we believe that the mix of contract types in fiscal year will be similar to fiscal year cost reimbursement contracts can include fixed fees  incentive fees  or award fees 
in the case of cost plus fixed fee contracts  the fee dollars are negotiated and fixed at the inception of the contract 
cost plus incentive fee contracts include a negotiated fee that may be adjusted during the performance of the contract by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs 
cost plus award fee contracts can include fees consisting of a base amount that is fixed at the inception of the contract and an award amount that is earned in whole or in part during the performance of the contract based upon the evaluation of the customer 
in fiscal year  we experienced significant revenue growth  which we believe was a result of increased spending by the us government on signal intelligence solutions 
we believe the us government s emphasis on protecting us citizens  due to the current state of world affairs  has created a renewed emphasis upon signal intelligence gathering 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions  and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and  therefore  consider these to be critical accounting policies 
see 
notes to condensed financial statements  
note summary of significant accounting policies  included elsewhere in this report for more information about these critical accounting poli cies  as well as descriptions of other significant accounting policies 
revenue and cost recognition 
the majority of our contracts are accounted for in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of opinion  accounting for performance of construction type and production type contracts 
these contracts are executed by using written contractual arrangements  most of which require us to design  develop  manufacture  and or modify our complex products  and perform related services according to specifications provided by the customer 
we account for cost reimbursement contracts by charging actual labor  materials  and other direct costs  plus estimated indirect costs of operations as incurred incurred costs 
indirect costs include overhead  research and development  and general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative costs are not applied to certain subcontract costs associated with our cost reimbursement contracts 
these subcontracts must be in excess of  and must meet certain other predetermined criteria 
we recognize contract revenues and profits on cost reimbursement contracts by applying an estimated fee rate to all incurred costs on an individual contract basis 
fee calculations are based on either negotiated fee amounts or management s assessment of the fee amounts that are likely to be earned 
our policy for recognizing interim fees on our cost plus award fee contracts is based on management s assessment as to the likelihood that the award fee or an incremental portion of the award fee will be earned  on a contract by contract basis 
management s assessments are based on numerous factors including contract terms  nature of the work to be performed  our relationship and history with the customer  our history with similar types of projects  and our current and anticipated performance on the specific contract 
no award fee is recognized until management determines that it is probable that an award fee or a portion thereof will be earned 
historically  management s estimates have generally been consistent with actual fees awarded 
however  changes in facts and circumstances could arise within an award fee period causing management to either lower or raise the award fee estimate in the period in which it occurs 
our engineering services contracts are typically performed on a level of effort basis 
revenue is recognized in accordance with our policy regarding cost reimbursement contracts 
we account for fixed price contracts by using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method  labor  materials  and other direct costs  plus estimated indirect costs of operations are charged as incurred incurred costs 
a portion of the contract revenue  based on estimated profits and the degree of completion of the contract as measured by a comparison of the actual and estimated costs  is recognized as revenue each period 
for those contracts in which all of the terms have not yet been finalized  revenue does not include an estimated fee rate on cost 
management reviews contract performance  costs incurred  and estimated completion costs regularly 
revenues and profits are adjusted on all contracts in the period in which changes  including anticipated losses  become determinable 
unexpected increases in the cost to develop or manufacture a product  whether due to inaccurate estimates in the bidding process  unanticipated increases in material costs  inefficiencies  or other factors  are borne by us on fixed price contracts  and could have a materially adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition 
unexpected cost increases in cost reimbursement contracts may be borne by us for purposes of maintaining customer relationships 
historically  the effect on operating results and financial condition from cost reimbursement losses has been minimal 
indirect rate variance adjustment to operations 
we record contract revenues and costs of operations for interim reporting purposes based on annual targeted indirect rates 
during our interim reporting periods  variances may accumulate between the actual indirect rates and the annual targeted rates 
timing related indirect spending variances are removed from contract costs  research and development  and general and administrative expenses and are included in inventory as part of work in process during these interim reporting periods 
these rates are reviewed regularly  and we record adjustments for any material  permanent variances in the period they become determinable 
we believe that this estimate is the preferred practice used within our industry 
at year end  the revenues and costs are adjusted for actual indirect rates 
our accounting policy for recording the indirect rate variance is based on management s belief that variances accumulated during interim reporting periods will be absorbed by expected contract activities during the remainder of the year 
we consider the rate variance to be unfavorable when our actual indirect rates are greater than our annual targeted rates 
in contrast  a favorable rate variance occurs when our actual indirect rates are lower than our annual targeted rates 
during interim reporting periods  unfavorable rate variances are recorded as reductions to operating expenses and increases to work in process inventory 
favorable rate variances are recorded as increases to operating expenses and decreases to work in process inventory 
if we anticipate that actual contract activities will be different than planned levels  there are alternatives we can utilize to reduce the variance we can adjust some of our planned indirect spending during the year  modify our billing rates to our customers  or record adjustments to expense based on estimates of future contract activities 
if our rate variance is unfavorable  the modification of our billing rates will likely increase revenue and operating expenses  and decrease inventory 
fee percentages on fixed price and cost reimbursement contracts will generally decline as a result of any increase to indirect costs 
if our rate variance is favorable  the modification of our billing rates will decrease revenue and operating expenses  and increase inventory 
in this event  fee percentages on fixed price contracts will generally increase 
fee percentages on cost reimbursable contracts will generally be unaffected as a result of any reduction to indirect costs  due to the fact that programs will typically expend all of the funds available 
any impact on operating income  however  depends on a number of other factors  including mix of contract types  contract terms  and anticipated performance on specific contracts  and anticipated changes in inventory 
at the end of fiscal year  we absorbed a favorable indirect rate variance that accumulated during the fiscal year  by modifying our billing rates to our customers  which reduced revenues by approximately  and operating expenses by approximately  at the end of fiscal year  there was a charge to profit of  for a bonus payment to our employees that was not recovered in our billing rates to our customers 
at certain points during fiscal year  we determined that a portion of the indirect expenses would not be absorbed by expected contract activities 
as a result  we recorded a charge to profit of approximately   and  during the second  third  and fourth quarters  respectively 
these additional charges reflect a total of approximately  in indirect expenses that was excluded from our indirect billing rates in fiscal year allowance for bad debt 
since the majority of our revenues are generated from the us government  we regard the credit risk of our business to be minimal 
we record allowances for bad debt as a reduction to accounts receivable and an increase to bad debt expense 
these allowances are recorded in the period a specific collection problem is identified 
once the receivable is deemed uncollectible  the allowance is reversed and the receivable is written off 
at october  and  there was no balance for the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at october   the allowance for doubtful accounts balance was  there was no charge to bad debt expense during fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded approximately  to bad debt expense 
in fiscal year  we charged approximately  to bad debt expense due to the write off of an uncollectible balance of one customer 
inventory valuation and disposal 
we provide advanced digital signal processing products and systems to the us government 
typical life cycles of our equipment are eight to ten years or more 
in addition  we maintain spare parts in order to repair the equipment 
we evaluate our inventory quarterly  at interim reporting periods  and assess our ability to sell our equipment  which includes raw materials 
historically  we have sold our inventory at full cost so there is limited decrement in valuation 
if it is determined that a product has reached the end of its life cycle or there is no longer a need for certain equipment  the remaining inventory is disposed 
historically  we dispose of inventory at approximately the same time that the reduction to inventory is recorded and we do not hold inventory reserves 
the charges associated with disposed work in process and finished goods are included in contract costs in our statement of operations 
disposed raw material represents a minor amount and is included in general and administrative expenses on the statement of operations due to the fact that raw materials could be used in a variety of situations other than contract costs  including r d 
inventory activities during fiscal year and fiscal year included disposing of approximately  and  respectively  of obsolete products 
the disposed items included units in various stages of completion 
income taxes 
our income tax expense at interim reporting periods is based on an estimated effective tax rate 
this estimated tax rate is calculated based on the projected net income at the end of the fiscal year  and is reviewed at each reporting period 
at the end of the fiscal year  income tax expense is adjusted for actual results 
our effective tax rate can differ from the statutory rate  such as a result of expected benefits from r d credits and the reversals of valuation allowances 
price redetermination 
as a government contractor  we are subject to price redetermination on certain fixed price contracts if it is determined that we did not price our products and services consistent with the requirements of the federal acquisition regulations 
we did not incur any price redeterminations on any of our contracts during fiscal years   or operating results fiscal years comparison the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues from contracts  and  at the end of each period indicated  our backlog year ended october  revenues from contracts operating expenses contract costs research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income interest income expense  net income before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss backlog thousands of dollars results in fiscal year  new orders increased  revenues increased  and ending backlog increased 
operating income increased as a percentage of revenues due in part to the growth in revenues  and  in part  to an increase in program profitability generated from the sale of certain products 
however  the increase in our effective tax rate caused net income to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
in fiscal year  new orders increased approximately  revenues increased  and ending backlog increased  when compared to fiscal year in addition  our operating expenses grew at a lower rate than revenues 
the growth in revenue  in conjunction with controlled spending  led to a increase in net income during fiscal year over fiscal year we believe the increase in revenues is the result of the us government s renewed interest in spending on signal intelligence solutions 
in fiscal year  we experienced a increase in orders compared to fiscal year this led to an increase in year over year revenues of and a increase in our ending backlog 
as a result of the growth in revenues in fiscal year and a lower operating cost structure when compared to fiscal year  we returned to profitability in fiscal year revenues revenues were approximately   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
revenues increased by during fiscal year over fiscal year and by during fiscal year over fiscal year the primary reason for the continued increase in revenues in recent years is an increase in engineering development efforts designed to provide a variety of signal intelligence solutions to the us government 
these signal intelligence solutions have helped to support the us government s efforts on counterterrorism 
the following table identifies the source of our revenues for fiscal years   and by customer type fy fy fy intelligence agencies military law enforcement foreign commercial within the customer types  two intelligence agencies and one branch of the military represented a significant portion of revenues 
the table below identifies the revenue concentration from each significant customer 
fy fy fy first intelligence agency second intelligence agency one branch of the military our largest contract  within one of the intelligence agencies  accounted for approximately   and of revenues in fiscal years   and  respectively 
another significant program  within one branch of the military  represented approximately of revenues for fiscal year this program began during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and generated an immaterial amount of revenue for that year 
revenues from the us government can also be categorized as direct purchases and subcontracts  where we are the supplier to another contractor 
the following table distinguishes revenue between those two categories 
fy fy fy direct purchases subcontracts new orders and backlog we received new orders of approximately   and  during fiscal years   and  respectively 
new orders have continued to increase in recent years due to the emphasis by the us government on counterterrorism 
our backlog consists of the uncompleted portions of existing contracts excluding unexercised options 
at the end of fiscal year  ending backlog was  representing a increase to fiscal year it should be noted that net new orders and backlog are expected to be reduced by approximately to million when we complete negotiations of a stop work order related to a portion of our largest contract 
these negotiations will clarify the scope of the stop work order 
we anticipate the completion of these negotiations during the first or second quarter of fiscal year we estimate that our opportunity to generate revenues from this contract was reduced by approximately to million in fiscal year  and will be reduced by approximately to million in fiscal year  and the balance in fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  ending backlog was approximately  representing a increase from fiscal year ending backlog of approximately  the increase to the ending backlog balance of fiscal year was due to new orders of approximately  during the fourth quarter 
contract costs contract costs consist of direct costs incurred in the performance of contracts  including labor  materials  and overhead costs 
contract costs were approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year  compared to approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year  and approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year the increase in our contract costs  in absolute dollars  in fiscal year  was consistent with our fiscal year revenue growth 
as a percentage of revenues  contract costs did not increase significantly over fiscal year the increase in contract costs  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was a result of an increase in our cost reimbursement contracts  since these contracts are typically negotiated for a smaller profit 
research and development expenses company directed investment in research and development consists of expenditures recoverable from customers through billing rates and expenditures funded by us from operations 
research and development expenses were approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year  compared to approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year  and approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year r d expenses grew in absolute dollars due to management s decision to return r d spending as a percentage of projected revenues to levels comparable to our long term business model 
the decrease in research and development costs in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due to management s decision to utilize labor resources to meet our contractual commitments and therefore reduce overall r d spending during fiscal year general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include administrative salaries  costs related to marketing and proposal activities  costs related to product warranties  and other administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses were approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year compared to approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year and approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year in fiscal year  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues due to our ability to support significant revenue growth without proportionately increasing general and administrative activities 
in fiscal year  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue as compared to fiscal year as a result of management s decision to hold our cost structure in place 
product warranties our products  including associated firmware and software  are warranted against defective workmanship and materials for a period of one year from the date of acceptance by the original purchaser 
in addition  we offer extended warranties at a percentage of the purchase price 
an additional six month warranty may be purchased for of the unit or system purchase price 
alternatively  an additional one year warranty coverage may be purchased for of the unit or system purchase price 
warranty costs were approximately   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
interest income expense  net net interest income for fiscal year was approximately  compared to approximately  and  of net interest income in fiscal years and  respectively 
our cash and investment balances continued to increase in fiscal year  which generated an increased amount of interest income  as compared to fiscal year net interest income in fiscal year was significantly higher than fiscal year due to increases in cash and investment balances and due to interest payments in fiscal year of approximately  related to federal and state tax liabilities 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes for fiscal years and resulted in income tax expense of approximately  and  respectively 
in fiscal year  our provision for income taxes resulted in a benefit of approximately  our operating income grew during fiscal year  which led to the increased effective tax rate of 
in addition  our income tax expense included a reduction of approximately  associated with the second quarter reversal of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was originally recorded in fiscal year during the second quarter of fiscal year  we concluded  based on our evaluation of all the criteria outlined in the applicable accounting literature  that our deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be realized 
therefore  the remainder of our valuation allowance was reversed in that period 
the effective tax rate at the end of fiscal year was and differs from the federal statutory rate and our estimated effective tax rate at the end of the third quarter  primarily due to the reduction of the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was reduced in the fourth quarter due to the availability of potential carryback refunds for taxes paid in fiscal year the benefit rate of was comprised of a federal benefit of  partially offset by a miscellaneous state income tax expense of  the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to federal and state tax credits  the usage of valuation allowance  and a benefit as result of a tax law change during fiscal year  which allowed us to recover additional taxes paid in prior years 
analysis of liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity during fiscal year were the cash flows generated from operations and the issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plans 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we discovered a misclassification in the previously reported october  balance sheet and cash flow statement 
at october   approximately  of asset backed securities was misclassified on the balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents instead of as short term investments 
the misclassification has no impact on our statement of operations for any period  including revenues and net income 
the october  balance sheet and fiscal year statement of cash flows in this report have been changed to reflect the correct classification 
cash from operating activities 
net cash from operating activities has fluctuated significantly from year to year 
net cash provided was approximately   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the year to year variances are primarily the result of changes in net income  accounts receivable  refundable income taxes  inventories held by us  and accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net income for fiscal years   and was approximately   and  respectively 
net income increased in fiscal year due to the growth in revenues and increased program profitability from the sale of certain products 
net income increased in fiscal year due  in part  to a significant growth in revenues  and in part  to our operating expenses experiencing proportionately less growth than revenue 
accounts receivable balances increased by approximately   and  during fiscal years   and  respectively 
our billed and unbilled receivables balances increased at a higher rate during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year due to the increase in fiscal year revenues 
the increase of accounts receivable balances in fiscal year was driven primarily by two factors 
first  our forward loss balance reduced by approximately  which was an element of unbilled receivables 
second  increased efficiency in our collection process led to an overall decrease of our billed receivables 
the net effect created an increase in total accounts receivable 
in fiscal years and  we did not generate any cash from refundable income taxes 
in fiscal year  we received a federal tax refund of approximately  which was recorded in fiscal year inventories  prepaid expenses  and other current assets decreased by approximately  in fiscal year inventories decreased by approximately  due to the disposal of approximately  in obsolete products 
the decrease in inventory was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets by approximately  which was primarily due to a net increase in current tax assets of approximately  in contrast  inventories  prepaid expenses  and other current assets increased by approximately  in fiscal year fiscal year activities included an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of approximately  which was primarily driven by an increase to current deferred tax assets of approximately  this increase was partially offset by a decrease in inventories of approximately  this decrease to inventory included approximately  in ob solete products that were scrapped 
in fiscal year  inventories decreased approximately  this decrease was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of approximately  which included an increase to deferred tax assets of approximately  and prepaid income taxes of  accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances increased in fiscal years   and by approximately   and  respectively 
in fiscal year  accrued payroll liabilities increased by approximately  due to an increase in accrued bonus expense of approximately  in addition  accounts payable balances increased during fiscal year by approximately  due to an increase in contract costs that were incurred at the end of our fiscal year 
in fiscal year  accounts payable balances increased by approximately  due to our increased activity in contract costs 
accrued payroll and related liabilities increased approximately  due to an increase in the number of employees hired to meet the increase in our contractual commitments 
in addition  accrued payroll liabilities included a bonus accrual of approximately  which was paid in december in fiscal year  accrued payroll related liabilities increased approximately  mostly due to an increased participation in the stock purchase plan by our employees 
trade accounts payable in fiscal year increased by approximately  as a result of improved contract activities 
other immaterial liabilities increased by approximately cash from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal years   and was approximately   and  respectively 
in fiscal year  we received proceeds of approximately  from our available for sale securities  which was partially offset by purchases of approximately  during the third quarter of fiscal year  the company adopted an investment policy with a shorter average maturity date for our investment securities  resulting in the sale of longer term securities  and the purchase of shorter term securities and cash equivalents 
in addition  investing activities for fiscal year included property and equipment purchases of approximately  primarily to support the increase in our staff 
in fiscal year  we purchased approximately  in available for sale securities  while approximately  matured 
in addition  fiscal year property and equipment purchases were approximately  fiscal year investing activities included purchases of available for sale securities of approximately  and property and equipment of approximately  cash from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately   and  during fiscal years   and  respectively 
the sources of cash from financing activities during each of these three years were the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and stock option plans 
the primary difference between financing activities in fiscal year and fiscal year is the increased amount of dividend payments during fiscal year fiscal year dividend payments were approximately  and in fiscal year dividend payments were  the differences between financing activities in fiscal years and were the significant increase in cash provided from stock options exercises during fiscal year  and the absence of dividend payments in fiscal year stock option exercises generated cash inflows of approximately  in fiscal year and approximately  in fiscal year cash is generated primarily from operating activities  employee stock activities  and investing activities 
we believe the primary risk to liquidity is the potential decrease in demand for our products and services 
historically  this demand has been influenced by the needs of the united states intelligence community 
we believe that the funds generated from operations  existing working capital  and the amount available under our existing line of credit will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months 
at october   we had a cash secured line of credit with a bank in the amount of  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s reference rate at october  and accrued interest on those borrowings were payable monthly 
no fees were associated with the unused portion of the committed amount 
the line of credit will expire on march  under the line of credit  we had two standby letters of credit totaling approximately  at october  one letter of credit  related to our facilities lease  was approximately  the second letter of credit was obtained during the first quarter of fiscal year as a requirement of our workers compensation insurance  and was approximately  at october   there were no other borrowings 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of october  in thousands 
payments due by period fiscal year total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total our operating lease obligations consist of non cancelable lease agreements for our facilities  which expire at various dates between fiscal years and certain leases contain escalation clauses and requirements for the payment of property taxes  insurance  and maintenance expenses 
we had outstanding letters of credit at october    and totaling approximately   and  respectively 
in fiscal year  we entered into a purchase agreement for computer equipment of approximately  as of october  there was approximately  outstanding  which was paid in fiscal year product warranties 
our products  including associated firmware and software  are warranted against defective workmanship and materials for a period of one year from the date of acceptance by the original purchaser 
in addition  we offer extended warranties at a percentage of the purchase price 
an additional six month warranty may be purchased for of the unit or system purchase price 
additional one year warranty coverage is of the unit or system purchase price 
warranty costs were approximately   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a variable interest entity is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
this pronouncement requires the consolidation of variable interest entities created after january  consolidation provisions apply for periods ending after march  for variable interest entities  other than special purpose entities  created prior to february  we do not have a ny variable interest entities  including special purpose entities  that must be consolidated and therefore the adoption of the provision of fin will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the eitf task force reached a consensus on issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance for determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired and the disclosure requirements relating to those impairments 
eitf is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of eitf did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 inventory costs  or sfas sfas amends arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
this statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material  and requires those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently assessing the potential impact of sfas in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas the statement requires that the costs resulting from share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the statement requires companies to use the fair value based payment measurement method in accounting for share based payment with employees as well as for goods and services received from non employees 
sfas r is effective for all awards granted after the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the adoption of this statement is expected to have a material impact on our financial positions or results of operations

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
the average days to maturity of our investment portfolio is days 
due to the short term nature of these cash investments  we do not believe that there is a material interest rate risk 
as of october   our total cash and investments balance that was sensitive to interest rate risk was approximately  the sensitivity of our portfolio is if yields were to fluctuate by basis points  the total effect to the investment portfolio balance would be approximately  the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents  and short term securities  at fair value  that are sensitive to interest rate risk in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term  available for sale securities asset backed securities corporate securities government securities money market securities
