overview 
a summary of our fiscal year results is as follows revenues grew over the prior year  primarily due to our tax services and business services segments  with this growth somewhat offset by a revenue decline at our mortgage services segment 
diluted earnings per share declined from fiscal year to  primarily due to lower profitability in our mortgage services segment 
current year results included a non operating gain of per diluted share for legal recoveries 
tax services fell short of its target client levels  although increases in our pricing and the complexity of returns prepared allowed the segment s revenue growth to continue 
segment revenues increased over the prior year and segment pretax income increased million  or 
mortgage services origination volumes of billion were at record levels  but margin compression drove gains on sales of mortgage assets to decline to million 
business services revenues and pretax income increased and  respectively  over the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher demand for traditional accounting  tax and consulting services 
investment services reported a pretax loss of million compared to million in the prior year 
operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year showed marked improvement  which we hope will continue into the fiscal year consolidated results of operations in s  except per share amounts restated restated year ended april  revenues

we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to securing an understanding of our financial statements  as they require the use of significant judgment and estimation in order to measure  at a specific point in time  matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop precisely as forecasted  and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment 
revenue recognition 
we have many different revenue sources  each governed by specific revenue recognition policies 
our revenue recognition policies can be found in item  note to our consolidated financial statements 
additional discussion of our recognition of gains on sales of mortgage assets follows 
gains on sales of mortgage assets 
we sell substantially all of the non prime mortgage loans we originate to the trusts  which are qualifying special purpose entities qspes  with servicing rights generally retained 
prime mortgage loans are sold in whole loan sales  servicing released  to third party buyers 
gains on sales of mortgage assets are recognized when control of the assets is surrendered when loans 
table of contents h r block form k are sold to trusts and are based on the difference between cash proceeds and the allocated cost of the assets sold 
we determine the allocated cost of assets sold based on the relative fair values of cash proceeds  msrs and the beneficial interest in trusts  which represents the ultimate expected outcome from the trusts disposition of the loans 
the relative fair value of the msrs and the beneficial interest in trust is determined using discounted cash flow models  which require various management assumptions  limited by the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans by the trusts see discussion below in valuation of residual interests and valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
the following is an example of a hypothetical gain on sale calculation in s acquisition cost of underlying mortgage loans fair values net proceeds beneficial interest in trusts msrs computation of gain on sale net proceeds less allocated cost   recorded gain on sale recorded beneficial interest in trusts recorded value of msrs   variations in the assumptions we use affect the estimated fair values  which would affect the reported gains on sales 
gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
see discussion in off balance sheet financing arrangements related to the disposition of the loans by the trusts and subsequent securitization by the company 
valuation of residual interests 
we use discounted cash flow models to determine the estimated fair values of our residual interests 
we develop our assumptions for expected losses  prepayment speeds  discount rates and interest rates based on historical experience and third party market sources 
variations in our assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values  which may require us to record impairments or unrealized gains 
in addition  variations will also affect the amount of residual interest accretion recorded on a monthly basis 
residual interests valued at million and million were recorded as of april  and  respectively 
we recorded million in net write ups in other comprehensive income and million in impairments in the income statement related to our residual interests during fiscal year as actual performance differed from our assumptions
