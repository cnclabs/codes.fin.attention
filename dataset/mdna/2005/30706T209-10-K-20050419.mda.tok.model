merger and change in fiscal year end on march   familymeds group  inc fmg entered into an agreement and plan of merger with drugmax  inc drugmax which was amended on july  and also on october  under the terms of the amended merger agreement  on november   fmg merged into drugmax  and drugmax was the surviving corporation in the merger the merger 
the separate existence of fmg ceased and the name of the surviving corporation is drugmax 
drugmax issued  shares of drugmax common stock to certain fmg preferred shareholders and fmg note holders in connection with the merger 
the fmg note holders received  drugmax shares in exchange for their notes and the remaining  drugmax shares were allocated to fmg s preferred shareholders based on liquidation preferences 
fmg s common shareholders received no consideration in the merger 
in addition  drugmax issued  shares of drugmax restricted common stock and options to purchase  shares of drugmax common stock at per share to certain employees and directors of fmg that remained employees and directors of drugmax after the merger and issued warrants to purchase  shares of drugmax common stock at per share to the former fmg stockholders  warrant holders and note holders 
the warrants were allocated among the fmg stockholders  warrant holders and note holders in the same manner as the drugmax common stock

table of contents overview we operate as one business segment which includes specialty pharmacy operations representing the prior fmg operations and drug distribution operations representing the prior drugmax operations 
we are a specialty pharmacy and drug distribution provider formed by the merger on november  of drugmax  inc and familymeds group  inc 
fmg 
we work closely with doctors  patients  managed care providers  medical centers and employers to improve patient outcomes while delivering low cost and effective healthcare solutions 
we are focused on building an integrated specialty drug distribution platform through our drug distribution operations and our specialty pharmacy operations 
as of january   we operated two drug distribution facilities  under the valley drug company and valley drug south names  and specialty pharmacies in states under the arrow pharmacy nutrition center and familymeds pharmacy brand names 
our platform is designed to provide services for the treatment of acute and complex health diseases including chronic medical conditions such as cancer  diabetes and pain management 
we often serve defined population groups on an exclusive  closed panel basis to maintain costs and improve patient outcomes 
we offer a comprehensive selection of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals  non prescription healthcare related products  and diagnostic supplies to our patients  independent pharmacies  physicians  clinics  long term care and assisted living centers 
as of january   we are in violation of certain financial and other covenants on our senior credit facility and the lender could demand repayment of the million outstanding as of january  and could foreclose upon all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries 
additionally  we have a history of losses 
these matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
management believes that the covenant violations were primarily attributable to lower than expected pre merger operating results of the drug distribution operations and the goodwill impairment charge 
management believes that with the purchasing synergies from the merger and the effect of the reduction in costs associated with the elimination of certain redundant positions as a result of the merger  that the company will continue as a going concern 
additionally  the company expects to receive an amendment to the senior credit facility during the second quarter of to waive existing covenant violations and amend covenant requirements going forward 
however  there is no assurance that the lender will waive the violations and the lender could demand repayment of the million outstanding as of january  and could foreclose upon all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries 
strategy general our primary strategy is to build an integrated specialty drug distribution platform with multiple sales channels 
we believe this can be accomplished through the integration of our drug distribution operations and specialty pharmacy operations and through internal growth and acquisitions 
we believe the integration will uniquely enable us to supply specialty drugs to patients  physicians and other healthcare providers 
our concept of locating specialty clinic pharmacy operations near or in medical facilities was originated by our ceo  edgardo mercadante 
the strategy is driven by the location concept whereby situating a clinical or specialty type pharmacy near the point of acute or chronic care provides us with a first capture opportunity to service patients when they visit their physicians 
this also enables us to collaborate with the physician in the therapeutic regimen and may provide opportunities for lower cost 
table of contents generic or alternative pharmaceutical therapy 
we have recently placed significant emphasis on the higher cost injectable and orally administered specialty pharmaceuticals 
our focus for the future is increasing pharmacy revenues through these specialty pharmaceuticals 
as such  we believe that our pharmacies are most appropriately called specialty pharmacies 
specialty pharmacy operations as of january   we operated corporate pharmacies and franchised pharmacies in states  respectively 
of our pharmacies are located at or near the point of care between physicians and patients  oftentimes inside or near medical office buildings or on a medical campus 
the majority of our revenues come from the sale of prescription pharmaceuticals which represented approximately of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended january  our corporate pharmacies provide services to over  acute and chronically ill patients each year  many with complex specialty and medical product needs 
we operate our pharmacies under the trade names familymeds pharmacy and arrow pharmacy and nutrition centers 
familymeds is primarily used for pharmacies outside of new england 
the familymeds locations were primarily originated by acquiring the base pharmacy business from hmo s  hospitals and regional independent operators 
the locations are primarily clinic size with a small footprint usually less than  sq 
ft 
the arrow trade name is used in new england where most of the pharmacies were opened as a start up or re acquired from former arrow franchise operators who opened these legacy pharmacy operations as start ups 
these locations are primarily apothecary size  approximately  sq 
ft 
and may be more visible as retail type locations  though primarily nearby hospitals or medical campus locations 
our locations in michigan and certain locations elsewhere throughout our trading area may have a larger footprint to accommodate a comprehensive inventory of nutritional and home medical supplies 
there are more than  locations at or near the point of care available to open pharmacies nationwide 
because of our experience with operating pharmacies in these locations  we believe we are uniquely positioned to target these sites and increase our core pharmacy market presence 
we also believe that we can grow our specialty pharmacy operations through selective acquisitions 
by increasing our store count  through acquisitions or the opening of new pharmacies at or near the point of medical care  we believe we can increase our customer base  leverage our existing infrastructure and expand our geographic reach 
our strategy also includes offering our customers multiple sales channels by which our customers can purchase our products 
we offer them the opportunity to purchase a broad array of health related products online including a comprehensive selection of prescription medications  vitamins and nutritional supplements  home medical equipment  and health and beauty aids directly from our specialty pharmacies  by mail order  and via the internet 
familymeds 
com is the foundation of our internet offering 
this website is one of the few sites certified as a verified internet pharmacy provider site vipps by the national association of boards of pharmacy nabp 
the vipps program is a voluntary certification program designed to approve and identify online pharmacies that are appropriately licensed and prepared to practice internet pharmacy 
familymeds 
com is the non prescription internet commerce partner for select prescription benefit managers pbms  including medco health 
we will continue to pursue opportunities to partner with managed care and others providers to increase our sales through our internet sales channel 
our newest strategy is to operate and locate worksite pharmacies sm pharmacies that service a single  defined population for large employers who are seeking to control overall employee prescription drug benefit expenditures while maintaining high employee satisfaction through improved accessibility 

table of contents our worksite pharmacies sm offer prescription services exclusively to the employer s covered population 
we can deliver these services at or near the employer s work site by opening  staffing and managing a pharmacy 
our initial results have proven that this strategy reduces healthcare costs for the employer 
our research has shown that many employers  especially large fortune companies  are seeking more aggressive methods to control healthcare expenditures  especially the pharmacy component of benefits 
we have identified key large employers  those with over  employees in a single location  to be target opportunities for this type of employer sponsored worksite pharmacy sm 
in late  we opened a worksite pharmacy sm in the employee center of the mohegan sun casino in connecticut with more than  employees and dependents as potential patients 
through march  our performance at this location has exceeded our expectations 
the company has developed special clinical compliance and generic therapeutic programs to attract patients and reduce pharmacy expenditures 
we also have active programs designed to improve patient compliance and to reduce costs 
we have three major programs  a prescription compliance program called reliable refill  a discount plan called senior save and an automated telephony system designed to notify patients of recalls  provide refill reminders and notify our customers of other important information 
reliable refill is a compliance program that identifies prescriptions that are due to be filled and schedules them for filling before the patient has run out of the previous prescriptions 
our senior save program  introduced prior to the medicare modernization act  is our own discount program that gives senior customers access to all of our prescription and over the counter products at discounted prices 
our programs are designed to improve medication therapy management among patients with chronic therapeutic needs especially the elderly population 
our data warehouse identifies these patients and allows us to target these patients with special needs 
we believe our data warehouse and our medication therapy management programs uniquely position our company as a specialty pharmacy provider 
although we do not offer franchises for sale at this time  in the case of renewing franchisees  we are subject to the disclosure requirements of the federal trade commission and may be subject to pre sale disclosure requirements and registration requirements of various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises 
in addition  with respect to our existing franchisees  we also are subject to certain state laws regulating the franchisor franchisee relationship 
failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial financial penalties 
as of january   we held franchise agreements for eight stores and are not materially dependent on these agreements 
we believe the number of our franchised pharmacy locations will decrease over the next few years 
drug distribution operations prior to the merger in november between drugmax and fmg  the merger in november  the distribution operations sold branded and generic pharmaceuticals  over the counter products  health and beauty aids  nutritional supplements and other related products through distribution centers located in pittsburgh and new castle  pennsylvania and in st 
rose  louisiana 
in july  the pittsburgh facility was closed and its customers were transitioned to the louisiana facility 
pharmaceuticals were distributed primarily to independent pharmacies and a limited number of small regional chain retail pharmacy operators 
historically  dock to dock services were also offered 
these services included receiving pharmaceuticals on behalf of distributor directly from pharmaceutical companies then re shipping to the distributor 
while the dock to dock business component of the distribution operation has been a significant source of revenues historically  it had been a low margin business 
therefore  in prior to the merger  the company discontinued this service 
the strategy  started prior to the merger  was to focus efforts on growing generic pharmaceutical revenues which have higher margins 
additionally  from time to time  the strategy included seeking to acquire additional complementary product lines that enhanced our ability to provide higher margin pharmaceuticals 

table of contents valley drug company  the new castle facility  carries a full line of pharmaceuticals and is an authorized distributor for the vast majority of branded pharmaceutical manufacturers including pfizer and glaxo smith klein 
an outside sales force has been used to generate sales from this facility 
valley drug south  the louisiana facility  also carries a full line of pharmaceuticals and has relied on an inside sales force and telemarketers to generate sales 
since the merger  our strategy has been to reduce our cost of goods sold by integrating our specialty pharmacy operations and our drug distribution operations  reducing our cost of goods on generic pharmaceuticals  and increasing our generic and higher margin specialty pharmaceutical sales to existing customers 
our distribution facility in st 
rose  louisiana now supports our specialty pharmacies and more than million annually of our pharmaceutical needs for our specialty pharmacies are being directly sourced through the st 
rose facility 
since the merger  we have entered into new purchasing agreements with several manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals  and a prime warehouse agreement with d k 
now  d k and the generic manufacturers deliver pharmaceuticals to our warehouse in louisiana where we combine the orders by store and ship the products directly to our specialty pharmacies 
these new agreements coupled with the integration of our two operations  we believe  will reduce our cost of goods sold 
the new drug distribution strategy is to focus on distributing higher gross margin specialty pharmaceutical and generic drugs across our existing fmg physician relationships through direct marketing 
in addition the revised strategy emphasizes acquiring new customers physicians  pharmacies and more specialty healthcare providers through implementing an inside telephonic sales and marketing method 
historically  drugmax had limited experience using these sales and marketing strategies  therefore  management cannot determine its potential success in acquiring and deriving revenue and profits until the new strategy is fully operational and a new customer relationship management system crm is deployed later in the second half of comparison of operating results for the fiscal years ended january   december  and december  we refer to prescription products as rx products and to the remaining products  such as over the counter medications  home medical equipment and home health appliances  as non rx products 
while non rx reflects a smaller percentage of our overall revenues  the gross margin for non rx products is higher 
the rx portion of the specialty pharmacy business is dependent upon a number of third party customers that pay a portion or all of the rx cost on behalf of the customers  third party customers 
prescriptions generated by third party customers represented approximately of specialty pharmacy s rx sales in the fiscal year ended january  and for the fiscal year ended december  revenues from our drug distribution operations were million from the date of merger through january   of which represented branded pharmaceuticals  represented generic pharmaceuticals and represented non rx products

weeks in non rx mail order contracts non rx sales other  net drug distribution operations net increase decrease from to early  the specialty pharmacy operations contracted with several managed care companies to provide services from its automated distribution facility 
in this form k  we will refer to this business as contracted business 
in december  fmg decided to close its automated distribution facility and significantly reduce its mail order and e commerce operations  including its contracted business 
these operations accounted for million of net revenues related to the contracted business prior to the reduction in operations at the end of the first quarter of fiscal our specialty pharmacy operations now use smaller scale mail order and e commerce operations to service rx and non rx customers 
the net effect of store openings closings represents the difference in revenues by eliminating stores that were not open during the full periods compared 
during  we closed stores that accounted for million of net revenues during fiscal and opened acquired eight new stores during fiscal  which added million of net revenues 
we closed five stores during fiscal that accounted for million of net revenues 
we sold seven stores during fiscal that accounted for million of net revenue and opened two new stores during the year that added million of net revenues 

table of contents the reduction in franchise royalties from fiscal to fiscal is mainly due to the termination of certain franchise agreements related to the specialty pharmacy operations 
represents the net impact of price increases for brand name prescription products offset by an increase in lower priced generic prescription products 
the company s fiscal year is a or week period ending on saturday nearest to december fiscal  which ended on january   included weeks 
fiscal and fiscal  which ended on december  and december   respectively  each included weeks 
represents post merger revenues from november  through january  for the drug distribution operations 
the drug distribution operations net revenues for calendar year prior to the merger from january  to november   were an additional million unaudited  or million in total for calendar year we expect the drug distribution operations net revenues to decline in compared to as a result of the elimination of forward buying  imas  and our strategy of focusing on higher margin products which have lower net revenues as discussed elsewhere in this k 
gross margin gross margin was million or in fiscal this compares to million or in fiscal and million or in fiscal the decrease in the gross margin percentage is primarily the result of the inclusion of the lower gross margin drug distribution operations from the date of the merger  through january   which negatively impacted the fiscal gross margin percentage by approximately basis points 
this trend will continue in as a result of the inclusion of a full year of operating results for the lower margin distribution operations  however  gross margin improvements are expected from purchasing synergies that will positively impact the specialty pharmacy operations and will partially offset the decline in gross margin percentage on an overall basis 
information that helps explain our gross margin trend is detailed below fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal gross margin increases decreases are as follows in millions specialty pharmacy operations contracted business net effect of store openings closings franchise royalties prescription gross margin non rx mail order contracts non rx gross margin effect of weeks in vs 
weeks in other  net drug distribution operations net decrease increase gross margins benefited from the reduction of our contracted business in early  which had gross margins of approximately  the impact of which was not significant on fiscal or fiscal gross margins 

table of contents the net effect of store openings closings represents the difference in gross margin by eliminating stores that were not open during the full periods compared 
fiscal reflects the adverse affect by the efforts of managed care organizations  pharmacy benefit managers and other third party payors to reduce their prescription costs 
in recent years  our industry has undergone significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs 
as employers and managed care organizations continue to focus on the costs of branded and specialty pharmaceuticals  we expect there will continue to be negative pressure on gross margins 
rx gross margin for the specialty pharmacy operations benefited from an increase in generic drug sales in fiscal  which normally yield higher gross margin dollars and percentages than brand name rx sales 
the company s fiscal year is a or week period ending on saturday nearest to december fiscal  which ended on january   included weeks 
fiscal  which ended on december   included weeks 
the gross margin earned on sales of the drug distribution operations was approximately from the merger date  november   through january  estimated future gross margin percentages are uncertain because of the reduced opportunities for forward buying  imas  reduced vendor charge backs and credits as discussed elsewhere herein 
total operating expenses operating expenses include selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  write downs of long lived assets  and the gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets and intangible assets 
intangible assets include the amounts allocated to prescription files for prescriptions acquired in previous purchase business combinations of the specialty pharmacy operations 
a prescription file refers to the actual prescription maintained by a pharmacy for each prescription filled 
each prescription file has monetary value to a pharmacy because when pharmacies and or prescription files are sold  the customers are more likely to leave their accounts with the purchaser than to transfer their business to a third party pharmacy  as such the prescription base is thought of as a repeatable source of revenue 
accordingly  when pharmacies are sold  the number of prescription files is taken into consideration when determining the purchase price of the pharmacy 
intangible assets also include goodwill  trademarks  and authorized distributor licenses which were recorded in connection with the merger 
the authorized distributor licenses permit the drug distribution operations to purchase pharmaceutical products directly from the manufacturers 
total operating expenses were million or of net revenues in fiscal this compares to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal and million  or of net revenues  in fiscal information that helps explain our operating expense trend is detailed below fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses increases decreases are as follows in millions specialty pharmacy operations selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expense impairments of long lived assets  excluding goodwill goodwill impairment charge gain on disposal of fixed assets and intangible assets drug distribution operations net increase

fiscal includes a million non cash charge relating to  restricted shares and  stock options granted to fmg employees in connection with the merger 
specialty pharmacy selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net specialty pharmacy revenues were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal is primarily due to a reduction in the number of stores and employees 
depreciation and amortization expense was approximately million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal includes amortization expense of million related to intangible assets recorded in connection with the merger for the period from november  to january  such amortization for fiscal will be approximately million 
during fiscal  and  we expensed approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to the impairment of prescription file intangible assets and estimated lease obligations for sold stores 
as of january   we completed an assessment of the carrying value of the goodwill related to our drug distribution reporting unit and we determined that a goodwill write off of million was required as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the reporting unit resulting from the decline in the price of our common stock since the merger terms were announced and declining profitability in the drug distribution operations as opportunities for forward buying and increased competition have negatively impacted estimated future cash flows

interest expense  net interest expense  net was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense  net from fiscal to primarily results from million of interest on fmg s million subordinated convertible notes issued in january these notes provided for interest at maturity of million 
accordingly  all interest was accrued as of the original maturity date october and no interest on the notes was recorded during the fiscal year ended january  these notes and the related interest were converted into shares of drugmax common stock in connection with the merger 

table of contents also in connection with the merger  drugmax issued warrants to purchase  shares of drugmax common stock at per share to the former fmg stockholders  warrant holders and note holders 
the warrants were allocated among the fmg stockholders  warrant holders and note holders in the same manner as the drugmax common stock 
drugmax recorded noncash interest expense of approximately million in fiscal related to the portion of the warrants issued to the former fmg note holders 
the charge was based on the fair value of the warrants to purchase  shares at per share issued to the fmg noteholders  using a black scholes valuation as of the merger date

net loss per share the net loss per basic and diluted share for fiscal was compared to a net loss per basic and diluted share for fiscal of and for fiscal as discussed above  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in fiscal of approximately million  which increased the net loss per basic and diluted share by 
the weighted average shares used in the calculation of net loss per share have been restated to give effect to the merger of drugmax with fmg 
the transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger  with fmg deemed the accounting acquirer 
accordingly  for periods prior to the merger  the shares outstanding represent the number of shares that former fmg common shareholders would have received in the transaction  on an as if converted basis  had the merger consideration not been distributed to the preferred shareholders based on liquidation values  or approximately million shares 
for periods subsequent to the merger  shares outstanding represent actual shares outstanding 
as of january   approximately million shares were outstanding 
future calculations of net loss per share or earnings per share will be based on the actual weighted average number of shares outstanding 
inflation and seasonality management believes that inflation had no material effect on the operations or our financial condition for fiscal  and management does not believe that our business is materially impacted by seasonality  however  significant promotional activities can have a direct impact on sales volume for our distribution operations in any given quarter

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not make use of any off balance sheet arrangements that currently have or that we expect are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we utilize operating leases for many of our store locations 
we do not use special purpose entities in any of our leasing arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a contains a discussion of the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates and judgments  including the most significant judgments and estimate 
we based our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other facts that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets merger related the merger resulted in million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
the values assigned to goodwill and intangibles  as well as their related useful lives  are subject to judgment and estimation by the company 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets related to the merger were determined based on the purchase price allocation 
the valuation of the identifiable intangible assets acquired was based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets  while the initial value assigned to goodwill was the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
judgments were required to estimate future cash flows in order to determine the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired as well as estimate the useful lives for the identifiable assets to be amortized over 
useful lives for identifiable intangibles are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including historical cash flows 
after goodwill is initially recorded  annual impairment tests are required  or more frequently if impairment indicators are present 
the amount of goodwill cannot exceed the excess of the fair value of the related reportable unit which is based on the company s stock price over the fair value of reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities 
downward movement in the company s common stock price has a material effect on the fair value of goodwill in future measurement periods 
as of january   we completed an impairment test of the goodwill related to the merger and determined that a write off of million was required which was recorded in fiscal the impairment of the drug distribution reporting unit is a result of lower revenues and profitability and a decline in the fair value of the company s common stock since the merger terms were announced and the purchase price was determined 
additionally  the drug distribution operations have experienced declining 
table of contents profitability as opportunities for forward buying and increased competition have negatively impacted profitability 
the company s stock price decreased from for the five day period from the merger announcement date to as of january  significant judgments and estimates were required in connection with the impairment test to determine the estimated future cash flows and fair value of the reporting unit 
to the extent our estimates change in the future or our stock price decreases from january   further goodwill writedowns may occur 
as of january   we had remaining goodwill of million recorded 
impairment of other long lived assets the company reviews other long lived assets  including property plant and equipment and prescription file intangible assets  to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the related assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets  including prescription file intangible assets  exceeds the future cash flows for the assets 
for purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment of other long lived assets  the company evaluates assets at the store level for specialty pharmacy operations 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainty since we must use judgment to estimate future sales  profitability and cash flows 
when preparing these estimates  we consider historical results and current operating trends and our consolidated revenues  profitability and cash flow results and forecasts 
these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  the cost of real estate  the continued efforts of third party customers to reduce their prescription drug costs  the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns 
if these projections change in the future  we may be required to write down our long lived assets 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment include property and equipment as well as intangible assets  which as of january  were approximately million and million  respectively  and million and million  respectively  at december  trade receivables allowance for doubtful accounts at january  and december   trade receivables included approximately million and million  respectively  of amounts due from various insurance companies  governmental agencies and individual customers 
of these amounts  there was approximately million and million reserved as of january  and december   respectively  for a balance of net trade receivables of million and million  respectively 
as of january  accounts receivable for drug distribution operations were million  which is net of a reserve of million we use historical experience  market trends and other analytical data to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts 
based upon these factors  the reserve at january  is considered adequate 
although we believe that the reserve estimate is reasonable  actual results could differ from our estimate  and such differences could be material 
if the estimate is too low  we may incur higher bad debt expenses in the future resulting in lower net income or higher net losses 
if the estimate is too high  we may experience lower bad debt expense in the future resulting in higher net income or lower net losses 
vendor rebates  allowances and chargebacks as of january  and december   amounts due from vendors relating to rebates  allowances and chargebacks were million and  respectively  which approximately million was reserved as of january  we are eligible for vendor rebates  allowances and chargebacks from pharmaceutical vendors and manufacturers based on contractual arrangements 
rebates and allowances are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold is the period they are received from the vendor or manufacturer unless such rebates and allowances are reasonably estimable at the end of a reporting 
table of contents period 
we record chargeback credits due from our vendors in the period when the sale is made to the customer which is eligible for contract pricing from the manufacturer 
the amounts due are often difficult to estimate based on changes in industry practices and amounts received may differ from our estimates 
if our estimate of amounts due from vendors is too high our earnings losses will be adversely effected in the future 
inventories inventories consist of pharmaceuticals and other retail merchandise owned by us 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method for pharmaceutical inventory and retail method for retail merchandise inventory or market 
physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each location to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated 
we use historical data to estimate our inventory loss reserves and we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our inventory loss reserves during the past three years 
if the estimate of inventory losses is too low we may incur higher cost of sales in the future resulting in lower net income or higher net losses 
if the estimate of inventory losses incurred is too high  we may experience lower cost of sales in the future resulting in higher net income or lower net losses 
inventories as of january  and december  were approximately million and million  respectively  net of approximately million and million of inventory loss reserves  respectively
