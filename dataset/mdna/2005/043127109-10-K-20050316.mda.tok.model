introduction we are a leading supplier of power conversion and embedded computing solutions 
our products are designed and manufactured to meet the system needs of oems in voice and data communications applications including server and storage  enterprise networking  wireless infrastructure and telecommunications 
we have a global presence in north america  europe and asia  including five manufacturing facilities and nine design centers 
our business is organized into two business segments  power conversion and communications products 
the power conversion segment designs and manufactures a broad range of power conversion products including ac dc  on board dc dc and pol converters 
additionally  we design and manufacture specific use power systems such as rectifiers and dc dc power delivery systems used in the wireless infrastructure and rf amplification system applications 
the communications products segment designs and manufactures embedded board level products and protocol software for applications  including cpus and wan i o boards 
our products are components and sub systems of our customers products  and accordingly  our revenue is dependent on the success of our customers products and services 
our customers success is impacted by macroeconomic and industry trends  primarily corporate spending on information technology and capital spending by communications services providers 
the market sectors in which we sell our products are extremely competitive 
in evaluating our products  customers consider quality  reliability  technology  service and cost relative to our competitors 
the trend towards dpa systems is the technological shift having the greatest impact in our power conversion segment 
we invest heavily in pol and other dpa technologies in order to grow our competitive advantage in this area 
in our communications products segment  telecommunications equipment and wireless infrastructure manufacturers are increasingly utilizing open standards in their products 
we have responded by investing in the development of new products that meet open standards  such as advancedtca 
in order to meet the cost requirements of our customers  we have consolidated our production in low cost countries 
we generate cash through net income  efficient working capital and capital equipment management and equity and debt financing transactions 
we are financed through a mixture of equity and debt 
we took actions in to lengthen the maturity of our debt and to allow us more flexibility to invest in our business 
our debt is in the form of convertible senior subordinated notes due in and an asset based senior revolving credit facility  the availability under which is determined in accordance with a borrowing base calculation using domestic accounts receivable and inventory 
overview following the severe downturn in the communications market in and  we initiated restructuring activities to lower operating costs  which were largely complete in beginning in late and throughout the end markets resumed growth 
to accommodate this growth  we set four objectives maintain profitability throughout the year  grow market share  enter new communications market segments and continue to invest in industry leading technology 
these goals were achieved during as outlined below maintain profitability 
we achieved profitability during the fourth quarter of and continued to incrementally grow earnings each sequential quarter in key contributors to earnings growth were increased revenues  driven by new product introductions and improvement in end market demand  as well as improved gross margins 
net income increased from million in the first quarter of to million in the fourth quarter 
in  net income was million  an increase of million from the net loss reported in gross margins  as a percentage of revenue  increased from in to in  due to a favorable sales mix  lower incremental costs on higher production volumes and manufacturing cost reductions  resulting from the prior years restructuring actions 
the improvement in profitability contributed to the increase in operating cash flow to million in after funding million of capital expenditures to expand production capacity  our cash and marketable securities increased million to million at the end of grow market share 
we consider revenue growth to be the most meaningful indicator of market share gains 
with revenue growth of in  our fastest growth was in the wireless infrastructure sector  which grew to of revenue in from in server and storage sector accounted for of our revenues  distribution and other was  and telecommunications and networking was in enter new market segments 
in  we successfully entered the power rectification and power amplification product segments  winning several large programs with major customers 
products for these new segments will be introduced into production in early with shipments starting in the second half of continue investments in technology 
to continue our leadership position within our core market sectors  it is necessary to invest in new technologies for future products 
during  we invested million or nearly of revenue in research and development  consistent with our spending 
this included spending on development of advancedtca products for embedded systems products  as well as a communications protocol for digitally controlled and monitored products within the power conversion segment 
a total of new product models  including new pol modules  were introduced in  across the power conversion and communications products segments  further expanding the large selection of innovative products available to our customers 
our performance in strengthened our competitive position within our target market sectors and further improved our financial condition 
our goals for are similar to  as we continue to focus on the faster growth markets within the communications industry  increasing market share with our significant customers and expanding our customer base 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by united states generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the impact and any associated risk related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or its current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly  and we consult with our sales and customer service organizations in order to determine the projections for each component and finished good 
due to the magnitude of the value of our inventory  unanticipated changes to our forecast or product lifecycles could result in adjustment to the provision for excess and obsolete inventory that is material to our results 
the estimate of inventory reserves is critical in both of our segments 
at december   our inventory reserve balance was million  representing of the value of our gross inventory 
this compares with million  or of gross inventory  at the end of the decrease in the reserve balance in is due to the disposal of obsolete inventory  offset by additional inventory provisions based on reductions in forecasted demand for certain products 
warranties the terms of the warranties we offer to our customers vary depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective products returned to us during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
at the time of sale  we record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual historical return rates and communications of warranty related matters from our customers 
changes in such estimates can have a material effect on net income 
the estimate of warranty obligations is critical in both segments 
the reserve is determined by first comparing the historical relationship between warranty costs  which are made up of labor and materials required to repair the parts returned  and revenue over the prior two years to calculate a rate 
the rate is then applied to shipments under warranty using a sliding scale  based on historical return patterns 
the reserve also includes specific large exposures that are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we have recognized expenses related to warranty costs of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established 
goodwill we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas goodwill and other intangible assets on december  under sfas  we assess goodwill using a two step approach on an annual basis in august of each year  our selected measurement date  or more frequently  if indicators of impairment exist 
sfas states that potential impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the assets of that unit 
the amount of the impairment to recognize  if any  is calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
management s assumptions about future sales and cash flows on which the fair value estimate is based require significant judgment as prices and volumes fluctuate due to changing business conditions 
the impact of recognizing a goodwill impairment charge was material to our results of operations in and could be material in the future to our consolidated financial results 
our updated assessment of impairment of goodwill in and concluded that impairment did not exist in those periods 
during  based on business conditions at that time  as a result of this assessment  we recognized an impairment loss of million 
for additional information on the assessment and impairment  please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
the balance of goodwill was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
we will continue to assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas in future periods 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to calculate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we compute our annual tax provision based on statutory tax rates and planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we earn income 
we establish reserves for income tax contingencies  in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies  when it becomes probable that a tax return position may not be successfully defended if challenged by taxing authorities 
these contingencies are adjusted based on facts and circumstances  such as the settlement of tax audits  changes in tax regulations and the expiration of statutes of limitations 
while it is difficult to predict the outcome or the timing of a resolution to any particular tax contingency  we believe that the recorded amounts reflect the probable outcome of any known tax items 
favorable resolutions of contingencies are recognized as a reduction to our tax provision in the period of resolution 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
factors considered in assessing the requirement for a valuation allowance are the carry forward period of our net operating losses  historical and expected future taxable income by jurisdiction and tax planning strategies 
due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of the net operating loss carry forwards before they expire  we recorded a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
net deferred tax assets were million and million  net of the valuation allowance  at the end of and  respectively 
results of operations consolidated sales 
the following table summarizes revenue by business segment in comparison to previous periods in millions compared to compared to power conversion communications products total in  revenue grew across all of our market sectors due to improved end user demand and increased market share with our existing customers 
revenue increased sequentially from million in the first quarter to million in the fourth quarter of power conversion revenue increased million in primarily due to higher sales to customers in the server and storage sector 
the higher sales were driven by increased end user demand  as corporations raised spending on information technology infrastructure after several years of constrained expenditures  and market share gains at our larger server and storage customers 
market share gains resulted from our ability to meet accelerated development schedules required to support several large customer programs and successful introduction of new products in  including higher power density ac dc front end power supplies 
in our communications products segment  revenue increased million in compared to prior year due to recovery of the wireless infrastructure market sector and market share gains at our larger wireless infrastructure customers 
our customers benefited from increased spending by communications service providers on wireless infrastructure due to the deployment of g and g networks 
we realized market share gains as our larger wireless infrastructure customers outsourced development of certain embedded systems to us and we have started to ship the resulting new products 
in the past  our customers would have designed and manufactured many of the embedded systems internally 
the increase in revenue in compared to was due primarily to higher sales to wireless infrastructure and telecommunications customers in our communications products segment  as our customers experienced an increase in end user demand 
this was partly offset by a decrease in sales to server and storage customers in our power conversion segment  reflecting a slowdown in demand for information technology infrastructure in the first half of gross profit 
below is a comparison of gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue for  and in millions compared to compared to gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue the increase in gross profit in of million  compared to  was primarily due to higher revenue partly offset by price concession to customers  the positive effect of sales mix and manufacturing cost reductions 
higher revenue and favorable sales mix contributed approximately million to the gross profit increase in sales mix reflects growth of our communications products segment  which includes higher margin software content and a historically higher pricing structure than power conversion  and accounted for of our total sales in compared to in manufacturing cost reductions resulting from our past restructuring actions contributed approximately million to the increase in gross profit in the restructuring actions  reflecting the closures of our kindberg  austria and youghal  ireland factories to reduce excess capacity and lower manufacturing costs  were substantially complete at the end of the increase in gross profit in compared to was due to manufacturing cost reductions resulting from our restructuring actions  the positive effect of sales mix and a million charge for increased excess and obsolete inventory reserves recorded in the charge resulted from a refinement in our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory resulting from industry trends toward shorter product lifecycles and other factors 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for  and are as follows in millions of revenue selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring and related charges goodwill impairment total operating expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in was primarily due to increases in expenses related to compliance with new regulatory standards  and increases in bonuses and sales commissions due to growth in revenues and profitability improvements in sg a increased by million in compared to prior year due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of million  offset by a million decrease in costs due to restructuring actions 
these restructuring actions  which are discussed below  were intended to reduce infrastructure and personnel and to maintain the proper relationship between operating expenses and revenue 
research and development expenses increased in in order to support revenue growth and new technology investments  including digital control in power conversion and advancedtca in communications products 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses were in each of the periods presented 
we believe a strong commitment to invest in research and development activities is vital to our ability to provide our customers with technologically capable  low cost product alternatives 
as a result  we expect the level of research and development expenses in to maintain its current relationship with revenue 
restructuring and related charges are discussed below in restructuring and related charges and goodwill impairment charges are discussed below in impairment of goodwill 
restructuring and related charges 
pursuant to our restructuring plans  we recorded restructuring charges of million and million in and  respectively 
restructuring charges recorded in were not significant 
the amounts recorded in relate to transfer of manufacturing functions to our china facility and further consolidation of our business in europe 
charges included million for employee termination costs and million related to facility closures 
restructuring charges recorded in included amounts related to the closure of our kindberg  austria and youghal  ireland manufacturing facilities 
charges were comprised of million for employee termination expenses  million related to facility closures and million to record a liability for payback of development grants in ireland 
for additional information on our restructuring actions  please see note of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill 
on december   we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of sfas  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization but is subject to an annual impairment test 
our annual assessment of the fair value of our reporting units was performed in and in accordance with sfas  with no impairment being recognized as a result of these assessments 
due to adverse business conditions in our end markets  our impairment tests performed in the third quarter of indicated that an impairment existed and we recognized a goodwill impairment loss in the power conversion segment for million and the communications products segment for million 
the total impairment charge of million is included in operating expenses in loss on debt extinguishment 
losses on debt extinguishment were million and million in and  respectively 
in conjunction with the placement of our convertible notes in  a portion of the net proceeds from the placement was used to pay off our then outstanding million subordinated convertible note to finestar international ltd 
finestar 
the losses on debt extinguishment were comprised of the accretion of the remaining debt discount related to the transactions with finestar million  along with the write off of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs million 
for additional information on the placement of convertible debt completed in and the transaction with finestar  please see note of the consolidated financial statements 
in march  we entered into an asset based revolving credit facility with fleet capital corporation  which replaced our prior revolving credit facility 
loss on debt extinguishment in also includes million in expense related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs in association with our previous credit agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to amend the revolving credit facility in place at that time 
one of the results of this amendment was a reduction in the overall availability borrowing capacity under the agreement 
we recorded debt extinguishment expenses of million at the time related to the reduction in the facility s capacity 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net is detailed as follows in millions compared to compared to interest expense less interest income net interest expense as discussed above  the promissory note previously outstanding with finestar was paid off in the third quarter of as a result of the placement of convertible notes in  the million note outstanding with finestar at was replaced with million of notes at 
the additional borrowings and the higher interest rate resulted in a higher interest expense in compared to the reduction in interest expense in compared to was primarily the result of the reduced level of borrowings 
we entered with substantially lower borrowings on our revolving credit facility compared to the beginning of during the first quarter of  we replaced our then existing revolving credit facility with a million  five year revolving asset based credit facility with fleet capital corporation 
using cash generated from operations  the outstanding debt on our credit facility was further reduced to zero at the end of  compared to million at the end of provision benefit for income taxes 
below is a comparison of the provision benefit for income tax and effective tax rate for  and in millions provision benefit for income taxes effective tax rate the difference in the and tax rates was due to the distribution of profits and losses by jurisdiction  adjustments to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets recorded at various locations  changes in tax regulations and a million benefit in from the release of a tax contingency accrual upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
the difference in the and tax rates was the result of losses in certain tax jurisdictions that require a valuation allowance for the related deferred tax benefits and non deductibility of the majority of the goodwill impairment loss 
net income loss 
the net income loss recorded in each of the last three years was as follows in millions  except per share data net income loss net income loss per basic share net income loss per diluted share basic shares outstanding diluted shares outstanding in comparison to  the increase in net income in resulted from the increased gross profit due to higher revenue  favorable product mix and manufacturing cost reductions 
in comparison to  the improvement in net loss in resulted from the goodwill impairment loss  the additional excess and obsolete inventory charges and the significantly higher restructuring charges that were recorded in in addition  the higher gross profit in as a result of manufacturing cost savings contributed to the improvement 
power conversion results for the power conversion segment in compared with prior years are as follows in millions compared to compared to revenue operating income loss the increase in revenue in the power conversion segment recorded in compared to prior year was primarily attributable to higher sales to our server and storage customers 
demand improved as corporations increased spending on information technology infrastructure  reversing trends experienced in previous years 
operating income increased million in compared to as a result of higher revenues and manufacturing cost reductions  partly offset by increased research and development expenses 
higher revenues contributed approximately million  including the favorable impact of lower marginal costs achieved through greater utilization of our factories 
manufacturing cost reductions resulting from our past restructuring actions increased operating income by approximately million in research and development costs increased million in to support revenue growth and investment in new technologies  such as digital control 
while research and development costs increased in  the relationship of such costs to our revenue remained consistent with the decrease in revenue recorded in compared to was primarily the result of lower sales to our server and storage customers  somewhat offset by increased sales to distribution customers 
the decline in server and storage revenue reflected lower demand from corporations for information technology infrastructure  occurring in the first half of we expanded our sales staff and distribution networks in the us and europe  resulting in the growth in sales to distribution customers in the primary reason for the lower operating loss in is a reduction in charges compared to the prior year 
operating income in included a million charge for goodwill impairment  an excess and obsolete inventory charge million and restructuring charges in excess of the amount recorded in million 
the remaining improvement was due to manufacturing costs savings from the restructuring actions implemented in communications products results for the communications products segment in compared with prior years are as follows in millions compared to compared to revenue operating income loss revenue increased in our communications products segment in compared to prior year primarily due to higher sales to our wireless infrastructure customers 
the increased sales reflect a recovery of demand in the wireless infrastructure market sector and market share gains at our larger customers 
the increase in revenue in compared to is primarily the result of higher sales to our wireless infrastructure and telecommunications customers 
sales of existing products grew as our customers responded to improved end user demand 
the effect of higher revenue contributed million to the increase in operating income in  partly offset by million in higher research and development costs to support revenue growth and fund development of products designed to meet advancedtca standards 
operating income improved million in from the operating loss reported in due to the reduction in charges and the effect of higher revenue of approximately million 
a goodwill impairment charge of million and restructuring charges of million were recorded in liquidity and capital resources the following table presents selected financial statement information for each of the past three years in millions  except statistical data cash and cash equivalents short term marketable debt securities long term debt and capital leases convertible subordinated debt cash and marketable securities  net of debt working capital statistics days of sales outstanding days of inventory on hand days of accounts payable outstanding the primary sources of cash currently available to us are cash on hand  cash from operations and funds available under our current revolving credit facility 
these amounts are available to finance capital expenditures  fund working capital needs and pay interest on our convertible senior subordinated debt 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at the end of to million at the end of however  a portion of our cash was used to purchase marketable debt securities  of which million was held at the end of cash and marketable securities increased in total by million in the primary source of cash in was net income  adjusted for non cash expenses 
cash flows from operating activities 
during  our cash flows from operating activities served as a source of cash of million 
net income  adjusted for non cash expenses  which include the effect of depreciation and amortization and various provisions and reserves  was the primary source of cash  providing us with million in operating cash during the year 
increases in accounts receivable million and inventories million  due to the higher level of sales  partly reduced cash provided by operating activities 
overall working capital performance was consistent with the level recorded at the end of a small increase in days of inventory on hand is due to the increase in the finished goods inventory levels maintained at local hubs for our major customers 
over the past three years  we have significantly improved our working capital performance as evidenced by the reduction in days of inventory on hand and the increase in days of accounts payable outstanding 
looking forward  we anticipate only modest improvement in our accounts receivable and accounts payable performance  as we believe we are operating at a close to optimal level for our industry 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities reflect a net cash use of million in  comprised primarily of capital expenditures million and investments in short term marketable debt securities million 
the increase in our capital expenditures in was inline with our prior expectations as the trends in design resulted in a higher number of surface mounted components in our products  which combined with the higher demand  dictated an increase in the number of smt lines  automated test equipment and other related production equipment we currently utilize 
in  we began to invest our excess cash that is not required to meet short term operating needs in marketable debt securities 
our investment policy is to protect the value of our investment portfolio and minimize principal risk by earning returns based on current interest rates 
our investments at december  consisted primarily of corporate  government and municipal debt securities with remaining contractual maturities of less than one year 
in the first quarter of  we paid the remaining million of contingent consideration for the acquisition of azcore technologies  inc in  we made deferred or contingent payments related to the acquisitions of spider software limited and azcore of approximately million 
all deferred and contingent obligations related to past acquisitions have been satisfied 
for additional information on our acquisitions  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from financing activities 
in  cash flows from financing activities were a source of cash of million 
the primary source of cash was the exercise of stock options 
on august   we completed an initial placement to qualified institutional investors of million of our convertible senior subordinated notes due  and on august   we completed the sale of an additional million 
net proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior subordinated notes in the third quarter of were approximately million of notes 
the placement was completed in order to replace the million convertible note that had previously been issued to finestar and to provide us with additional long term working capital 
the promissory note with finestar was to mature in and contained a provision that allowed either party to redeem the note in january the new convertible debt issuance has an extended maturity date and the possibility of redemption on the part of the holder is removed 
there is no financial covenant requirements associated with the convertible senior subordinated notes 
for additional information on the terms of the notes  please see note of the consolidated financial statements 
on january   we received an investment by finestar  an entity controlled by mr 
bruce cheng  founder and chairman of delta electronics  a leading global power supply  electronic component and video display manufacturer and one of our competitors 
after the first closing of our august placement of convertible senior subordinated notes due  we fully paid the convertible subordinated note outstanding with finestar 
additionally  because the finestar note has been paid in full  the shares of our common stock underlying the convertible note are no longer issuable upon conversion or subject to the registration statement on form s filed in connection with the finestar transaction 
on march   we entered into a five year  million senior revolving credit facility with fleet capital corporation 
the asset based facility replaced our prior senior revolving credit facility that was due to expire in march for additional information on the terms of our new asset based credit facility  please see note of the consolidated financial statements 
on the day the agreement was completed  we used million of cash on hand to pay off the amounts outstanding under our previous credit facility 
we then borrowed million on the new facility  resulting in a net reduction of total outstanding borrowings of million 
while the total availability under the facility may be as high as million  the amount available to be borrowed is based on our level of qualifying domestic accounts receivable and inventory  which is subject to changing business conditions 
generally  as our level of qualifying accounts receivable and inventory increases  our availability increases up to the prescribed limit 
as of the end of  our outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was zero  and our availability was million 
in addition to other affirmative and negative covenants customary for asset based credit facilities  we are also subject to an ebitda covenant that is triggered if the amount available to be borrowed plus cash deposited with fleet bank falls below million 
as of the end of the year  the availability and the cash deposited with fleet were above the prescribed limit  and we were not subject to the additional covenant 
up to million of the facility s capacity can be used for letters of credit 
our sources of cash are the cash we currently have on hand  the availability under on our asset based credit facility and cash generated from net income 
we are expecting to generate cash from net income in  but if our projections are significantly below our expectations  we believe that our other sources of cash are sufficient to cover our operating expenses  capital expenditures  restructuring requirements and interest payments for the next twelve months 
if we are not able to generate cash from operations for a sustained period of time  we would  after our cash on hand and available line of credit were depleted  need to identify additional sources of cash 
these sources could include additional issuances of debt or equity  sales of equipment or portions of the business 
from a long term perspective  our sources of cash are expected to remain the same 
we are dependent on generating cash from operations as our primary long term source of cash 
we would be required to identify other long term sources of cash if we were not able to generate cash from operations or if we decided to take on a strategic initiative  such as an acquisition  which would require cash 
we continually evaluate options with respect to additional financing  including the sale of debt or equity instruments and portions of the business 
any such financing or sale transactions could have an adverse effect on our stock price and could dilute our shareholders ownership interest in our company

forward looking statements typically use words or phrases such as estimate  plans  projects  anticipates  continuing  ongoing  expects  believes  or words of similar import 
we caution readers that a number of important factors  as well as factors discussed in our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission  could affect our actual results and cause them to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
forward looking statements included in this form k are made only as of the date hereof  based on information available as of the date hereof  and subject to applicable law to the contrary  we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
our future profitability depends on our ability to successfully develop and market our products in a volatile  competitive industry characterized by rapidly changing prices  technologies and customer demand 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  changing customer demands  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and  in some cases  short product life cycles 
the development of new  technically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment  as well as an accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
to respond to the needs of our customers in the communications industry  we must continuously develop new and more advanced products at lower prices 
we are making significant investments in next generation technologies  but there can be no assurance that these investments will lead to additional revenue and profitability 
our inability to properly assess developments in the communications industry or to anticipate the needs of our customers could cause us to lose business with our current customers and prevent us from obtaining new customers 
additionally  because our products are incorporated into our customers products as components or sub systems  our future profitability depends on the success of our customers products and the health of the communications industry in general 
price erosion due to competition could have a material effect on our profitability 
we operate in an industry where quality  reliability  stability  product capability and other factors influence our customers decisions to purchase our products 
because of the highly competitive nature of our industry  the price of our products is also a factor  and it could become a more important factor the more competitive our industry becomes 
the competitive nature of our industry could result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share  each of which would adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our strategies to manage the competition include  but are not limited to  maintaining an appropriate level of investment in research and development and sustaining and expanding relationships with our customers in the high growth sectors of our industry  however  there can be no assurance that such strategies will be effective 
we face risks by having most of our manufacturing capacity concentrated in foreign locations 
in  approximately of our total sales were from products manufactured in china and europe 
the closure of our facilities in austria and ireland in has concentrated our manufacturing capacity of our power conversion segment to our low cost facilities in china and hungary 
the cost structure of these facilities and its relationship to our customers expectations for the price of our products makes our future success dependent on the ability to efficiently utilize our foreign manufacturing locations 
international operations  however  are subject to inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  interruptions in air or sea transportation  political or economic changes  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  foreign currency exchange rates and potentially adverse tax consequences  any or all of which could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products and deliver those products to our customers 
we rely on significant relationships with a small number of customers and the loss of any of those customers or significant reductions in their purchases of our products could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
our ten largest customers accounted for of our total sales for the fiscal year  with sales to dell computer and ibm accounting for approximately and of our total sales  respectively 
the telecommunications industry has recently experienced a consolidation of both us and us companies  as evidenced by the merger of at t wireless and cingular 
as a result of these factors  it is possible that in fiscal and subsequent years an even greater percentage of our revenues will be attributable to a limited number of large service providers than in the past years 
while we are designed in to and derive revenue from several distinct products with each customer  we do not have long term contracts with customers and decisions by a small number of our customers to defer their purchasing decisions or to purchase products elsewhere could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the majority of our customers maintain a second source for the products they purchase from us and therefore could shift their purchases to another vendor 
in addition  if we were to experience an unanticipated catastrophic quality issue ie  a product or design failure  or even a less than catastrophic but significant issue  with one of our customers especially one of our two largest customers that threatened our relationship with that customer  the competitive nature of our industry could allow that customer to terminate its relationship with us and move its business to one of our competitors 
furthermore  a majority of our largest customers customarily dual source their major programs  meaning that they purchase comparable products or components from two sources to ensure a reliable supply of component parts for their products 
if we were to experience supply or quality issues on a dual sourced program  the customer could choose to move a greater percent of their orders to the secondary source without significant disruption to their supply chain 
if demand for our products were to increase  we could face production capacity constraints 
our current manufacturing capabilities are inline with the level of production we expect over the near term 
if demand were to increase drastically from our expectations  we would be forced to add additional production capacity on very short notice 
if our capacity constraints keep us from fulfilling customers orders  it could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations 
we face risks associated with the sale of our products in foreign locations 
international sales have been  and are expected to continue to be  an important component of our total sales 
in  international sales represented of our total sales 
because our customers do business in international locations  our future success is dependent on our continued growth and our ability to administer our sales operations in foreign markets 
the success and profitability of our international operations is subject to inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  increased import duties  interruptions in air or sea transportation  political or economic changes  difficulties in managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  foreign currency exchange rates and potentially adverse tax consequences  any or all of which could adversely affect our operations 
our future profitability may be adversely affected by a disruption in our supply chain 
as a result of the custom nature of certain of our manufactured products  components used in the manufacture of our products are currently obtained from a limited number of suppliers  and a small percentage of components are purchased from a single vendor 
should any of our suppliers have significant issues in designing or manufacturing our components in accordance with quality specifications or related regulations  there could be a disruption in our supply chain while we resolve the issues or transition to a different vendor 
a change in suppliers  which could take several months to properly transition  could cause a delay in manufacturing  additional manufacturing costs and a possible loss of sales that could adversely affect our future operating results and financial position 
with an asset based credit facility  we face risks associated with fluctuating credit availability 
the amount available for borrowing under our senior credit facility is calculated as a percentage of our domestic accounts receivable and inventory that meet certain criteria as set forth in the credit agreement  minus reserves as determined by our lender 
our lender maintains the right to change the advance rates and eligibility criteria for our domestic accounts receivable and inventory and the discretion to change or institute new reserves against our availability 
accordingly  the amount available for borrowing under our senior credit facility may be reduced due to the reduction in the amount of our eligible assets resulting from changing market conditions  and the application of or changes to eligibility criteria  as well as the reduction of advance rates and or the increase or change in reserve amounts  which may be imposed at the discretion of our lender 
these factors could have the result of reducing the amount we may borrow under the facility at a time when we have a need to borrow additional amounts or requiring repayments under the facility at a time when we do not have adequate cash flow to make such repayments or when such repayments may not be in our best interest due to the economic climate and or our financial condition at that time 
these consequences could negatively impact our liquidity and such impact could be material 
as of december   however  there were no amounts outstanding under our asset based revolving credit facility 
the provisions of our credit agreement could affect our ability to enter into certain transactions 
our senior credit facility may restrict our ability to enter into certain corporate transactions including  among other things  the disposition of assets  making certain capital expenditures and forming or acquiring subsidiaries unless we obtain the prior written consent of fleet capital corporation 
because we cannot guarantee that fleet capital corporation will  in all circumstances  provide consent for the specific purposes for which we intend  our ability to enter into certain corporate transactions  to the extent that we may require capital in addition to our cash and investments on hand  may be prohibited or delayed 
market consolidation could create companies that are larger and have greater resources than us 
our principal competitors include acbel polytech taiwan  delta electronics taiwan and thailand  emerson electric  invensys uk  lite on taiwan  power one  tyco international and motorola 
if our competitors consolidate  they would likely create entities with increased market share  customer bases  proprietary technology  marketing expertise and sales forces and would likely have increased purchasing leverage for acquiring raw materials 
such a development may create stronger competitors  which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets we serve 
we face  and might in the future face  intellectual property infringement claims that might be costly to resolve 
we have  from time to time  received  and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting that our products or technology infringe on a third party s patent or other intellectual property rights 
such claims have resulted in litigation in the past  and could result in litigation in the future 
if we do not prevail in any such litigation  our business may be adversely affected  depending on the technology at issue 
in addition  our industry is characterized by uncertain and conflicting intellectual property claims and  in some instances  vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have on occasion resulted in protracted and expensive litigation 
we cannot make the assurance that intellectual property claims will not be made against us in the future or that we will not be prohibited from using our technologies subject to any such claims or that we will not be required to obtain licenses and make corresponding royalty payments 
in addition  the necessary management attention to  and legal costs associated with  litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our future success could depend on the protection of our intellectual property  costs associated with enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our operating results 
we generally rely on patents and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in some of our technology and products  and such protections may become more important in our industry 
while we have been issued a number of patents and other patent applications are currently pending  there can be no assurance that any of the patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any rights granted under these patents will  in fact  provide us with competitive advantages 
in addition  there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications  or that claims on future patents will be broad enough to protect our technology 
also  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results 
our future profitability may be adversely affected by a change in governmental regulation 
our operations are subject to laws  regulations  government policies and product certification requirements worldwide 
changes in such laws  regulations  policies or requirements in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or sell our products could result in the need to modify products and could affect the demand for our products  which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 
for instance  in january of the european union issued directive ec of the european parliament and of the council  which restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 
this legislation is effective beginning july  in addition  several of our customers that operate in the regions not affected by this regulation have nevertheless chosen to comply with its provisions to reduce the hazardous impacts on the environment 
in order to comply with this legislation  we have identified alternative materials and manufacturing processes that have successfully passed our qualification and reliability testing 
while we expect to be fully compliant with this legislation within the required timeline  failure to achieve compliance could negatively impact our revenue 
we rely on certain key personnel and a loss of such personnel could adversely affect our business 
if we lose one or more members of senior management  or if we cannot attract and retain qualified management or technical personnel  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our capacity to develop and implement new technology depends on our ability to employ personnel with highly technical skills 
competition for such qualified technical personnel is intense due to the relatively limited number of engineers available 
increased leverage as a result of the issuance of our convertible debt may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   we had million of outstanding debt as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet included in this filing 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and the terms of the outstanding convertible notes do not restrict our future issuance of indebtedness 
our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations  including  without limitation a portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of interest required with respect to outstanding indebtedness  increases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as to competitive pressure  and depending on the levels of our outstanding debt  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate and other purposes may be limited 
our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance  which will be subject to the success of the marketing of our products  general economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt  we may be required  among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  including our outstanding convertible notes  or to sell selected assets 
such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms 
we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase our convertible notes upon a change of control 
our convertible notes issued in include a provision that the note holders have the right to tender the notes and request that the notes be repurchased if a change of control occurs 
should a change of control occur  no assurance can be given that we will have sufficient funds available to purchase notes that are tendered for repurchase or that we will be able to arrange financing on favorable terms 
a failure to repurchase the tendered notes constitutes an event of default under the indenture 
our board of directors ability to issue preferred shares could deter a change in control that could be profitable to our shareholders 
pursuant to our certificate of incorporation  as amended  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  of which  have been designated as series a junior participating preferred stock in connection with our rights agreement  and to establish the preferences and rights of any such shares of preferred stock issued 
the issuance of the preferred shares can have the effect of creating preferential dividends and or other rights and or delaying  making more difficult  or preventing a change of control of our company  even if a change of control is in the shareholders interest 
we have a rights agreement that could deter a potentially profitable take over by a third party 
under our rights agreement  rights are issued along with each of our shares of common stock 
a holder of such rights can purchase from us  under specified conditions  a portion of a preferred share  or receive common stock of our company  or receive common stock of an entity acquiring us  having a value equal to twice the exercise price of the right 
the exercise price of the right is currently 
our rights agreement may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company  even if a change of control is in the shareholders interest 
there are certain provisions of florida law that could limit acquisitions and changes of control 
the florida business corporation act  as amended  contains a section entitled control share acquisitions  which  in certain circumstances  eliminates the voting rights of shares acquired in quantities so as to constitute control shares  as defined under florida law 
florida law also restricts business combinations between our company and owners of our common stock unless certain conditions are met or the transaction is approved by two thirds of the voting shares of disinterested shareholders or by a majority of our disinterested directors 
these provisions may also have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our company or of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of our company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current trading price 
our shareholders will be diluted if we issue shares subject to options  warrants  convertible notes or payment of matching contributions under our k plan 
as of december   we had reserved the following shares of our common stock for issuance  shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants held by finestar international  which are subject to anti dilution provisions that provide for adjustments to the exercise price of the warrants for issuances of additional securities below a certain price   shares issuable pursuant to stock options outstanding   shares available for future grant under our stock option plans   shares issuable upon conversion of convertible senior subordinated notes issued in august  and  shares for the purpose of making matching contributions under our k plan 
the issuances of some or all of this reserved common stock would dilute our existing stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the past  we have managed our interest rate risk on variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swaps  pursuant to which  we exchanged our floating rate interest obligations for fixed rates 
the fixing of the interest rates offsets our exposure to the uncertainty of floating interest rates during the term of the debt 
we have significant assets and operations in europe and asia and  as a result  our financial performance could be affected by significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate potential adverse trends  our operating strategy takes into account changes in exchange rates over time 
accordingly  in the past  we have entered into various forward contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency revenues 
the principal currency hedged was the euro 
it is our policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet the objectives  as stated above 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
gains or losses that result from changes in foreign currency rates are recorded at the time they are incurred 
these gains or losses were not material in and in  we recorded a gain on foreign exchange transactions of million 
we currently have no hedging instruments outstanding
