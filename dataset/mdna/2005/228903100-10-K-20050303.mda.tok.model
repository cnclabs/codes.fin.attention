item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview for cryolife inc  cryolife or the company  the year ended december  was a period of continued growth of bioglue surgical adhesive bioglue 
for the year ended december  bioglue revenues accounted for of total revenue and for the first time supplanted preservation service revenues as the top component of company revenue 
bioglue revenues were enhanced by the bioglue syringe product  which was introduced in  and a list price increase that went into effect on december  domestically and in early internationally 
an additional list price increase on bioglue was implemented on january  cryolife continued to experience the ongoing effects of the august  order from the atlanta district office of the us food and drug administration fda the fda order  which resulted in the recall of certain tissues processed by the company between october  and september   and subsequent fda activity 
preservation service revenue in was negatively impacted by a shortage of high demand tissues available for shipment 
tissue scarcity was a direct result of increased tissue processing and release times and lower yields of implantable tissue per donor as a result of process changes implemented subsequent to the fda order  the exhaustion of much of the company s supply of tissue processed prior to october   and a reduction in procurement levels during the company experienced improvements in yields of implantable tissues per donor and margins for its tissue business during over the levels experienced in  and is taking steps intended to further improve its yields through process changes and process directives 
the company is also working to increase procurement of human tissues for processing over the levels experienced in the company instituted list fee increases for its cardiovascular and vascular tissues in july and january  to reflect the higher cost of processing these tissues subsequent to the fda order 
cryolife continued to actively monitor its cash flows in an effort to reduce the operating cash shortfall experienced by the company since the fda order 
the company focused its research and development spending on key opportunities  limited its capital expenditures  and targeted spending on regulatory filings to projects with strong market potential 
bioglue margins continued to be in excess of  and bioglue revenues provided operating cash flows to support the tissue business 
tissue margins are expected to improve as the company works to increase yields of implantable tissues per donor and to increase service fees to support higher tissue processing costs 
the company is also closely monitoring expenses related to the defense and resolution of lawsuits  in an effort to reduce selling  general  and administrative costs from the levels seen in and see item business 
for further discussion of the company s business and activities during critical accounting policies a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the consistent application of these policies enables the company to provide users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the following are accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
product liability claims in the normal course of business as a medical device and services company  the company has product liability complaints filed against it 
following the fda order  a greater number of lawsuits than has historically been experienced have been filed 
the company maintains claims made insurance policies to mitigate its financial exposure to product liability claims 
claims made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect 
thus  a claims made policy does not generally represent a transfer of risk for claims and incidents that have been incurred but not reported to the insurance carrier during the policy period 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to unreported product liability claims  and records accruals as necessary for the estimated cost of unreported claims related to services performed and products sold 
the company retained an independent actuarial firm to perform revised estimates of the unreported claims  the latest of which was performed in january as of december  the independent firm estimated the unreported product loss liability using a frequency severity approach  whereby  projected losses were calculated by multiplying the estimated number of claims by the estimated average cost per claim 
the estimated claims were calculated based on the reported claim development method and the bornhuetter ferguson method using a blend of the company s historical claim experience and industry data 
the estimated cost per claim was calculated using a lognormal claims model blending the company s historical average cost per claim with industry claims data 
based on the information included in the actuarial valuation  management has included an accrual of million as of december  for estimated costs for unreported product liability claims related to services performed and products sold prior to december  this accrual reflected management s estimate based on information available to it at the time the estimate was made 
actual results may differ from this estimate 
further analysis indicated that the liability could be estimated to be as high as million  after including a reasonable margin for statistical fluctuations based on actuarial simulation techniques 
the million balance is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million and other long term liabilities of million on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
as of february  the company had three outstanding product liability lawsuits against the company that are covered by three separate insurance policies  beginning with the policy year the company believes its insurance policies to be adequate to defend against the covered lawsuits in each of these time periods 
additionally  the company has five outstanding product liability lawsuits against the company that are not covered by insurance policies  as either the company has used all of its insurance coverage related to that policy year  or the claims were asserted against the company in periods after the coverage in the related incident year had lapsed 
additional uninsured claims may be filed in the future 
other product liability claims have been asserted against the company that have not resulted in lawsuits 
the company is monitoring these claims 
the company performed an analysis as of december  of the settled but unpaid claims and the pending product liability claims based on settlement negotiations to date and advice from counsel 
as of december  the company had accrued a total of million for settled but unpaid claims and pending product liability claims and recorded million representing amounts to be recovered from the company s insurance carriers 
the million accrual is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
this amount represents the company s estimate of the probable losses related to two settled but unpaid claims and three of the eight pending product liability claims 
the company has not recorded an accrual for the remaining five product liability claims because management has concluded that either a loss is remote or that  although a loss is reasonably possible or probable  a reasonable estimate of that loss or the range of losses cannot be made at this time 
the amount recorded as a liability is reflective of estimated legal fees and settlement costs related to these claims  and does not reflect actual settlement arrangements  actual judgments  including punitive damages  which may be assessed by the courts  or cash set aside for the purpose of making payments 
the company s product liability insurance policies do not include coverage for any punitive damages  which may be assessed at trial 
additionally  if the company is unable to settle the outstanding claims for amounts within its ability to pay or one or more of the product liability claims in which the company is a defendant should be tried with a substantial verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff s  there can be no assurance that such verdict s would not exceed the company s available insurance coverage and liquid assets 
if the company is unable to meet required future cash payments to resolve the outstanding product liability claims  it will have a material adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of the company 
see legal proceedings at part i  item for further discussion of the company s product liability claims 
deferred preservation costs tissue is procured from deceased human donors by organ and tissue procurement agencies  which consign the tissue to the company for processing and preservation 
preservation costs related to tissue held by the company are deferred until revenue is recognized upon shipment of the tissue to the implanting facilities 
deferred preservation costs consist primarily of direct labor and materials including laboratory expenses  tissue procurement fees  freight in charges  and fringe benefits  and indirect costs including allocations of costs from departments that support processing activities and facility allocations 
deferred preservation costs are stated on a first in  first out basis at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
the calculation of deferred preservation costs includes a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the costs included in deferred preservation costs contain several estimates due to the timing differences between the occurrence of the cost and receipt of final bills for services 
costs that contain estimates include tissue procurement fees  which are estimated based on the company s contracts with independent procurement agencies  and freight in charges  which are estimated based on the company s prior experiences with these charges 
these costs are adjusted for differences between estimated and actual fees when invoices for these services are received 
management believes that its estimates approximate the actual costs of these services  but estimates could differ from actual costs 
total deferred preservation costs are then allocated among the different tissues processed during the period based on specific cost drivers such as the number of donors and the number of tissues processed 
at each balance sheet date a portion of the deferred preservation costs relates to tissues currently in active processing or held in quarantine pending release to implantable status 
the company applies a yield estimate to all tissues in process and in quarantine to estimate the portion of tissues that will ultimately become implantable 
management determines this estimate of quarantine yields based on its experience in prior periods and reevaluates this estimate periodically 
due to the nature of this estimate and the length of the processing times experienced by the company  actual yields could differ from the company s estimates 
a significant change in quarantine yields could materially affect the deferred preservation costs per tissue  which could impact the amount of deferred preservation costs on the company s balance sheet and the cost of preservation services  including the lower of cost or market write down  described below  on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
during the company recorded impairment write downs of deferred preservation costs totaling million as a result of the fda order 
the amount of these write downs reflected management s estimates based on information available to it at the time the estimates were made and actual results did differ from these estimates 
the write down created a new cost basis  which cannot be written back up if and when these tissues become available for distribution 
the cost of human tissue preservation services in and was favorably affected by tissue shipments that were related to previously written down deferred preservation costs 
the cost of human tissue preservation services is not expected to be materially affected by these write downs in future periods 
the company regularly evaluates its deferred preservation costs to determine if the costs are appropriately recorded at the lower of cost or market value 
based on those evaluations  the company recorded expenses of million and million  respectively  for and as an increase to cost of preservation services on its consolidated statements of operations 
these charges reflect the write down of the value of certain deferred tissue preservation costs that exceeded management s estimates of the tissue s market value based on recent average service fees 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
as of december  deferred preservation costs consisted of million for allograft heart valve tissues   for non valved cardiac tissues  million for vascular tissues  and million for orthopaedic tissues 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax return purposes 
the company generated significant deferred tax assets beginning in primarily as a result of write downs of deferred preservation costs  accruals for product liability claims  and operating losses  reflecting reductions in revenues and additional professional fees  as a result of the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and reported tissue infections 
the company continued to generate deferred tax assets for the twelve months ended december  and primarily as a result of operating losses 
the company periodically assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance when management believes it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company evaluated several factors to determine if a valuation allowance relative to its deferred tax assets was necessary during the company reviewed its historic operating results  including the reasons for its operating losses in and  uncertainties regarding projected future operating results due to the effects of the adverse publicity resulting from the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and reported tissue infections  the changes in processing methods resulting from the fda order  and the uncertainty of the outcome of product liability claims 
based on the results of this analysis  the company determined that it was more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets would not be realized 
therefore  as of december  the company had a total of million in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and a net deferred tax asset balance of zero 
as of december  the company updated the evaluation of its deferred tax assets 
the company reviewed its historic operating results  including the operating losses which continued in  uncertainties regarding projected future operating results due to the effects of the fda order and subsequent activity  changes in processing methods subsequent to the fda order  and the uncertainty of the outcome of the remaining product liability claims 
based on the results of this analysis  the company determined that it was more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets would not be realized 
therefore  as of december  the company had a total of million in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and a net deferred tax asset balance of zero 
new accounting pronouncements the company was required to adopt emerging issues task force eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
the company adopted the recognition and measurement guidance of eitf for the interim period ending september  and the annual disclosure requirements for its year ended december  eitf clarifies the definition of and accounting treatment for other than temporary losses on debt and equity investments 
the adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance of eitf did not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of the company 
the financial accounting standards board has delayed implementation of certain requirements under eitf until the requirements are finalized the company cannot determine the effect of fully adopting eitf on the results of operations or financial position 
the company adopted eitf accounting for claims made insurance and retroactive insurance contracts by the insured entity eitf for the interim period ended june  eitf clarifies reporting for insurance policies  including providing guidance in accounting for prospective and retroactive insurance policies and guidance for situations when a company s fiscal year and insurance policy period do not coincide 
the adoption of eitf resulted in the company recording additional legal accruals and offsetting amounts recoverable from insurance as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings 
the company will be required to adopt sfas revised share based payment sfas r for the interim period ending september  sfas r requires companies to recognize the cost of all share based payments in the financial statements using a fair value based measurement method 
based on its preliminary analysis  the company anticipates that the effect of implementing sfas r on its results of operations will be less than the amounts in the pro forma footnote disclosures currently required  but will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  assuming that the company s stock price  option terms  and amounts of option grants are comparable with the company anticipates it will adopt sfas r using the modified version of prospective application  as defined in sfas r 
however  the company is continuing to evaluate the adoption of sfas r 
the company will be required to adopt sfas inventory costs sfas for the fiscal year ending december  sfas requires current period expensing of items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs and requires allocation of fixed production overheads to be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas on its results of operations and financial position 
results of operations in thousands year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues     revenues increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of bioglue and orthopaedic and vascular tissue preservation service revenues as compared to the prior year period 
revenues increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of bioglue  partially offset by decreases in cardiovascular and vascular tissue preservation service revenues as compared to the prior year 
a detailed discussion of the change in bioglue revenues and in preservation service revenues for each of the three major tissue types processed by the company continues in the detailed sections below 
bioglue three months ended december  twelve months ended december  bioglue revenues     bioglue revenues as a percentage of total revenue revenues from the sale of bioglue increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  the increase in revenues consisted of a increase due to volume  a increase due to price  and a increase due to foreign exchange 
the volume increase was primarily due to demand for the new bioglue syringe product  which was introduced in mid  partially offset by decreases in other bioglue products as customers transitioned to the syringe product 
the price increase was primarily due to an increase in average selling prices  due to list price increases that went into effect on december  domestically and in early internationally 
revenues from the sale of bioglue increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the increase in revenues consisted of an increase due to volume  a increase due to price  and a increase due to foreign exchange 
the volume increase was primarily due to demand for the new bioglue syringe product  which was introduced in mid and contributed of total sales of bioglue 
approximately of the volume increase in bioglue was due to customers that did not purchase bioglue in or smaller volume increases were noted in all other bioglue products 
the price increase was primarily due to an increase in average selling prices  due to the list price increases discussed above 
domestic revenues accounted for of total bioglue revenues in and of total bioglue revenues in the company anticipates that revenues from bioglue will continue to grow in as compared to on january  the company initiated list price increases for bioglue products 
the company anticipates that this price increase will favorably affect revenues in  in addition to anticipated growth in bioglue domestic and international sales volume 
cardiovascular preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  cardiovascular revenues     cardiovascular revenues as a percentage of total revenue revenues from cardiovascular preservation services increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  the increase in revenues consisted of a increase due to price  largely offset by a decrease due to volume 
the price increase reflected the fee increase that went into effect in july the fee increase primarily increased revenues for traditionally processed pulmonary valves and aortic valves 
the volume decrease was primarily due to a decrease in shipments of aortic and pulmonary valves 
the decrease in heart valve shipments reflects the continuing impact of the fda order and subsequent fda activity  as reflected in the reduced amount of tissues available for implantation due to a reduction in procurement levels during  the exhaustion of much of the company s supply of heart valve tissue processed prior to october   increased tissue processing and release times  and lower yields of implantable tissue per donor as a result of process changes implemented subsequent to the fda order 
revenues from cardiovascular preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the decrease in revenues consisted of a decrease due to volume  partially offset by an increase due to price 
the volume decrease was primarily due to a decrease in shipments of aortic and pulmonary valves  including synergraft processed valves  which demand higher service fees than traditionally processed valves 
the decrease in heart valve shipments reflects the continuing impact of the fda order and subsequent fda activity  as discussed above 
the price increase reflected the fee increase as discussed above 
revenues from cardiovascular preservation services for the twelve months ended december  include  in favorable adjustments to estimated tissue recall returns due to lower actual tissue returns under the fda order than were originally estimated in the company s procurement of cardiac tissues during the twelve months ended december   from which heart valves and non valved cardiac tissues are processed  decreased as compared to twelve months ended december  procurement levels of cardiac tissues remain significantly below procurement levels in the second quarter of  prior to the fda order 
the company anticipates that cardiovascular service revenues will benefit in if and to the extent tissues available for implantation increase due to expected improvements in the company s tissue processing yields 
process changes were implemented during and others are expected to be implemented in cardiac revenues for should also be favorably affected by the fee increases implemented in july and january  reflecting increased tissue processing costs 
as discussed in item business 
the company suspended the use of the synergraft technology in the processing of allograft cardiovascular tissue and in late september suspended the distribution of tissues on hand that were processed with the synergraft technology until the regulatory status of the cryovalve sg is resolved 
at this time  the company cannot estimate when or if it will resume processing allograft cardiovascular tissue using the synergraft technology  which historically yielded a higher price and margin than processing without synergraft 
the suspension had an adverse effect on revenues and margins for the company s tissue preservation services 
vascular preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  vascular revenues     vascular revenues as a percentage of total revenue revenues from vascular preservation services increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  the increase in revenues consisted of a increase due to price and a increase due to volume 
the price increase reflects the fee increase that went into effect in july on all vascular tissues 
the volume increase was primarily due to an increase in shipments of saphenous veins  due to improvements in availability of tissue as a result of improved yields during the second half of  partially offset by decreases in femoral vein shipments 
revenues from vascular preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the decrease in revenues consisted of a decrease due to volume  partially offset by a increase due to price 
the volume decrease was primarily due to a decrease in shipments of saphenous veins 
decreases were also experienced in synergraft processed femoral veins and arteries and traditional processed femoral veins  partially offset by increases in shipments of femoral arteries 
the decrease in vein shipments also reflects the impact of the fda order and subsequent fda activities  as reflected in the reduced amount of tissues available for implantation due to a reduction in procurement levels during  the exhaustion of much of the company s supply of vascular tissue processed prior to october   the suspension of shipments of synergraft processed femoral veins and arteries  and increased tissue processing and release times and lower yields of implantable tissue per donor as a result of process changes implemented subsequent to the fda order 
the price increase reflects the fee increase as discussed above 
revenues from vascular preservation services for the twelve months ended december  include  in favorable adjustments to estimated tissue recall returns due to lower actual tissue returns under the fda order than were originally estimated in the company s procurement of vascular tissues during the twelve months ended december  decreased as compared to twelve months ended december  procurement levels of vascular tissues remain significantly below procurement levels in the second quarter of  prior to the fda order 
the company anticipates that vascular service revenues will also benefit in if and to the extent tissues available for implantation increase through expected improvements in the company s tissue processing yields  as well as from the fee increases implemented in july and january orthopaedic preservation services december  december  orthopaedic revenues    orthopaedic revenues as a percentage of total revenue the company s orthopaedic preservation services were most affected by the fda order and subsequent fda activity 
revenues from orthopaedic preservation services increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  the increase in revenues consisted primarily of an increase due to volume 
the volume increase was primarily due to an increase in shipments of boned and non boned tendons 
increases were also experienced in shipments of menisci 
the increase in orthopaedic tissue shipments is directly related to the low volumes of shipments in due to temporary suspensions of orthopaedic tissue processing and shipments in and low levels of orthopaedic tissues available for shipment due to the disposal of much of the company s supply of orthopaedic tissue processed prior to october   increased tissue processing and release times  and lower yields of implantable tissue per donor as a result of process changes implemented subsequent to the fda order 
revenues from orthopaedic preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the increase in revenues consisted primarily of an increase due to volume  partially offset by a decrease due to price 
the volume increase was primarily due to an increase in shipments of boned tendons 
increases were also experienced in non boned tendons and menisci 
the increase in orthopaedic tissue shipments is directly related to the low volumes of shipments in as discussed above 
the increase in average service fees that went into effect in july for cardiovascular and vascular tissues did not include an increase in orthopaedic tissue processing fees 
revenues from orthopaedic preservation services for the twelve months ended december  include  in favorable adjustments to estimated tissue recall returns due to lower actual tissue returns under the fda order than were originally estimated in the company s procurement of orthopaedic tissues during the twelve months ended december  increased as compared to twelve months ended december  procurement levels of orthopaedic tissues remain significantly below procurement levels in the second quarter of  prior to the fda order 
the company anticipates that orthopaedic service revenues will also benefit in if and to the extent tissues available for implantation increase through expected improvements in procurement and in the company s tissue processing yields 
in addition  the company anticipates reintroducing osteochondral grafts in early  which have not been part of the company s service offerings since the fda order was issued in august grant revenues grant revenues decreased to  in from  in grant revenues in and were attributable to the activation control technology act research and development programs through aurazyme pharmaceuticals  inc aurazyme and the synergraft research and development programs 
in february the company formed the wholly owned subsidiary aurazyme to foster the commercial development of act  a reversible linker technology that has potential uses in the areas of cancer therapy  fibrinolysis blood clot dissolving  and other drug delivery applications 
the defense appropriations conference report included million for the development of biofoam 
cryolife plans to submit a proposal to the department of defense for the use of these funds by the end of february these funds are expected to result in an increase in grant revenues in cost of products cost of products aggregated million in compared to million in the increase in cost of products was primarily due to higher bioglue sales levels during when compared to cost of products as a percentage of total product revenues was in compared to in the decrease is primarily due to a favorable product mix driven by an increase in revenues from bioglue  which carries higher gross margins than bioprosthetic devices 
gross margins related to bioglue improved in as compared to as a result of increasing manufacturing efficiencies  higher throughput  and an increase in average selling prices 
the company anticipates aggregate cost of products will increase in to reflect volume increases 
the cost of products as a percentage of product revenues for is expected to be lower than due to favorable product mix  reflecting anticipated increased bioglue revenues relative to other product revenues 
cost of human tissue preservation services cost of human tissue preservation services increased to million in as compared to million in cost of human tissue preservation services for and includes the increases to cost of preservation services of million and million  respectively  reflecting the write down of certain deferred tissue preservation costs to market value 
see critical accounting policies deferred preservation costs above 
the increase in cost of human tissue preservation services is primarily due to increasing tissue processing costs due to process changes implemented subsequent to the fda order 
the write down of deferred tissue preservation costs in both and is primarily due to higher overhead cost allocations per unit associated with lower tissue processing volumes  changes in processing methods subsequent to the fda order  and a decrease in shipments of tissues processed with the higher margin synergraft process as compared to traditional processing 
cost of human tissue preservation services as a percentage of tissue preservation service revenues was in as compared to in cost of human tissue preservation services as a percentage of tissue preservation service revenues was favorably affected by shipments of tissue with a zero cost basis for which revenues were recognized but costs  estimated to be  in and million in  had already been recorded in previous periods primarily related to write downs of deferred preservation costs in the write downs of deferred preservation costs during created a new cost basis  which cannot be written back up when these tissues are shipped or become available for shipment 
the company anticipates that the aggregate cost of human tissue preservation services will increase if volume increases in the company anticipates that cost of human tissue preservation services as a percentage of tissue preservation service revenues will benefit in from any increases in the amount of tissues processed  or any increases in yields of implantable tissue per donor  as well as increases in average service fees due to fee increases implemented in july and january the cost of human tissue preservation services as a percentage of revenue will likely continue to be high compared to pre fda order levels as a result of lower tissue processing volumes and changes in processing methods  which have increased the cost of processing human tissue 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses general  administrative  and marketing expenses decreased to million in  compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
general  administrative  and marketing costs include net expenses related to litigation of million in and million in see legal proceedings at part i  item and critical accounting policies product liability claims for further information 
excluding the effect of litigation expenses  general  administrative  and marketing expenses in decreased slightly from the remaining decrease is primarily due to a reduction in legal and consulting fees related to product liability and regulatory issues of million  partially offset by an increase of approximately million in insurance premiums  separation costs related to the departure of two members of company management of  and an increase of approximately  in accounting and audit fees related to efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of general  administrative  and marketing expenses in both periods were impacted by increased insurance costs  legal costs  and professional fees as compared to pre fda order levels 
the company anticipates that insurance costs  legal costs  and professional fees will continue to be higher in than those experienced prior to the fda order 
the company presently expects general  administrative  and marketing expenses to be comparable to  excluding the effect of implementing sfas r as discussed in new accounting pronouncements above  although several important components are difficult to estimate or control 
for example  the company will continue to evaluate the level of accruals for product liability claims and make adjustments as required based on periodic actuarial analyses and product liability claim status 
adjustments to these accruals may be required during  and the effect of these adjustments may be favorable or unfavorable to general  administrative  and marketing expenses 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  representing of total revenues during these periods 
research and development spending in and was primarily focused on the company s tissue preservation  synergraft  and protein hydrogel technologies  which include bioglue and related products 
the company anticipates research and development expenses will increase in when compared to  due to increased spending on research related to the protein hydrogel technology used in bioglue  including biofoam  biolastic  biodisc  and new product line extensions for bioglue  synergraft  and tissue preservation 
the biofoam spending increase will be due in part to the defense appropriations conference report discussed in grant revenues above 
other costs and expenses interest expense decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease was due to the company s reduced average debt balances in as compared to  as a result of the company s pay off of the outstanding balance of its term loan in the third quarter of interest expense in and included interest on the financing of insurance premiums associated with the yearly renewal of certain of the company s insurance policies 
interest income decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease was due to the company s reduced average balances of cash and marketable securities during as compared to  as the company used cash to support ongoing operations and resolve product liability claims 
see additional discussion of the company s cash position in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
the company s income tax benefit of million in was primarily due to the receipt of tax refunds of million and anticipated refunds of million related to product liability expenses incurred in and the company did not record a receivable for the million carryback of expense in prior periods due to uncertainty regarding its realizability 
the company recorded a full valuation allowance against the tax benefit on the other losses generated in the company s income tax expense of million in was primarily due to the expense related to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
the effective income tax rate was in and  excluding the effects of the valuation allowances 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues as reported     estimated tissue recall returns  adjustment to estimated tissue recall returns adjusted revenues a     a the measurement adjusted revenues is defined as revenues prior to estimated tissue recall returns and adjustments made to estimated tissue recall returns 
this measurement may be deemed to be a non gaap financial measure as that term is defined in regulation g and item e of regulation s k and is included for informational purposes to provide comparable disclosure in the current and prior periods of revenues derived from services provided with respect to tissues and products shipped in the normal course of business 
the gaap number revenue as reported in the prior year periods was calculated by deducting the amount of estimated tissue recall returns for subsequent returns of fda recalled tissues from revenue related to tissues and products shipped in the normal course of business 
in order to compute revenues as adjusted this unfavorable item from the prior periods was added back to show a clearer comparison to current year periods and to illustrate the magnitude of the decrease in current year revenues 
the adjustment to estimated tissue recall returns was recorded during the current year periods to reduce the original estimate of the effect of returns of fda recalled tissues based on revised estimates 
in order to compute revenues as adjusted this item from the current year periods was added back for the reasons discussed above with respect to estimated tissue returns 
the presentation of revenue as reported without the presentation of adjusted revenues might mislead investors with respect to the magnitude of the decrease in the company s current year revenues relative to the prior year 
revenues as reported increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to continued growth in sales of bioglue  partially offset by a decrease in tissue service revenues 
revenues as reported decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  revenues as reported for the twelve months ended december  include  in favorable adjustments to the estimated tissue recall returns due to lower actual tissue returns under the fda order than were originally estimated 
revenues as reported for the twelve months ended december  were adversely affected by the estimated effect of the return of tissues subject to recall by the fda order  which resulted in an estimated decrease of million in preservation service revenues 
as of december  there was no remaining accrual for estimated return of tissues subject to recall by the fda order 
adjusted revenues decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this decrease in adjusted revenues for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in cryopreservation services revenues for cardiac  vascular  and orthopaedic tissues when compared to the prior year period  partially offset by an increase in sales of bioglue 
further discussion of the decrease in cryopreservation service revenues for each of the three major tissue types processed by the company and the increase in bioglue revenues continues in the detailed sections below 
bioglue three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues as reported     bioglue revenues as reported as a percentage of total revenue as reported bioglue revenues as reported as a percentage of total adjusted revenues a revenues as reported from the sale of bioglue increased and  respectively  for the three and twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december  the increase in revenues as reported for the three months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in bioglue sales volume due to an increase in demand in both foreign and domestic markets which increased revenues by  and an increase in average selling prices which increased revenues by 
the increase in revenues as reported for the twelve months ended december  was due to an increase in bioglue sales volume due to an increase in demand in both foreign and domestic markets which increased revenues by  and by an increase in average selling prices which increased revenues by 
volume increases in both the three and twelve months ended december  were led by large percentage increases in the bioglue ml and ml product sizes

the decrease in average service fees was largely driven by a change in product mix as shipments of heart valves decreased  while shipments of lower fee cardiac tissues such as non valved conduits and patch material increased 
the decrease in heart valve shipments is directly related to the reduced amount of tissues available for implantation due to a reduction in procurement levels during  the disposal of much of the company s heart valve tissue processed prior to october  and increased tissue processing times and lower yields of implantable tissue per donor as a result of process changes implemented in the latter half of and during in addition average service fees were negatively impacted by the company s suspension of shipments of synergraft processed cardiac tissues  which usually demand higher average service fees for heart valves and for non valved cardiac tissues

during the company temporarily suspended its processing of orthopaedic tissues as a result of the fda order 
the company resumed limited processing of orthopaedic tissues in late february and began shipments of these orthopaedic tissues processed since february with the shipment of non boned orthopaedic tissues in may and boned orthopaedic tissues in august during september the company halted the shipment of boned orthopaedic tissues in order to conduct an additional review of the systems in place to process and release boned orthopaedic tissues 
in december the company resumed shipment of boned orthopaedic tissues after the completion of its review 
these suspensions of processing  combined with the disposal of much of the company s orthopaedic tissue processed prior to october  in accordance with the fda order  resulted in low levels of orthopaedic tissues available for shipment in the latter half of and much of as a result of effects of the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and related events as discussed in item business

in february the company formed the wholly owned subsidiary aurazyme to foster the commercial development of act  a reversible linker technology that has potential uses in the areas of cancer therapy  fibrinolysis blood clot dissolving  and other drug delivery applications 
distribution revenues decreased to zero in from  in distribution revenues consisted of commissions received for the distribution of orthopaedic tissues for another processor 
cost of human tissue preservation services cost of human tissue preservation services decreased to million in as compared to million in cost of human tissue preservation services for includes an increase to cost of preservation services of million to adjust the value of certain deferred tissue preservation costs that exceeded market value  and the favorable effect on gross margin of approximately million related to shipments of tissue with a zero cost basis due to the prior write downs of these deferred preservation costs in the second and third quarter of the cost of human tissue preservation services for includes million in write downs of deferred preservation costs for tissues subject to the fda order 
the remaining decrease in costs is largely due to the reduced amount of tissue preservation services and related costs in the first seven months of as compared to the first seven months of  which was prior to the issuance of the fda order 
cost of human tissue preservation services as a percentage of total human tissue preservation service revenues was in compared to in the decrease in cost of human tissue preservation services as a percentage of revenues was also due to the effects of the adjustments and write downs in and discussed above  partially offset by an increase in overhead allocations associated with lower tissue processing volumes  changes in processing methods resulting from the fda order  and a decrease in tissue shipments of valves processed with the higher margin synergraft process as compared to traditional processing 
cost of products cost of products aggregated million in compared to million in the decrease in cost of products in was primarily due to a million write down of bioprosthetic valves  including synergraft and non synergraft processed porcine valves  in the third quarter of due to the company s decision to stop future expenditures on the development and marketing of these valves and to maintain its focus on its preservation services business and its bioglue and synergraft bovine vascular graft product lines 
the remaining increase in cost of products was due to higher bioglue sales levels during when compared to cost of products as a percentage of total product revenues was in compared to in the decrease is primarily due to the write down in discussed above 
the remaining decrease was due to a favorable product mix driven by an increase in revenues from bioglue  which carries higher gross margins than bioprosthetic devices 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses general  administrative  and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
the increase in expenses was primarily due to an accrual of million for the estimated and actual expense to resolve ongoing product liability claims in excess of insurance coverage  million for estimated unreported product liability claims related to services performed and products sold prior to december   and  for required insurance retention payments for the company s product liability insurance policies related to prior policy years see legal proceedings at part i item for further discussion of these items 
general  administrative  and marketing costs in were unfavorably impacted by a million accrual for estimated product loss claims incurred but not reported as of december  and a million accrual for retention levels under the company s liability and directors and officers insurance policies 
additional increases in costs for were due to an increase of approximately million in professional fees legal  consulting  and accounting due to increased litigation and issues surrounding the fda order and subsequent fda activity and an increase of approximately million in insurance premiums  offset by a million decrease in marketing expenses  including personnel costs and sales commissions 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses in both periods were impacted by increased insurance costs  legal costs  and professional fees as compared to pre fda order levels 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased to million in  compared to million in  representing of total revenues during these periods 
the decrease in research and development spending for year ended december  was primarily due to a delay in the timing of several external research studies  which are expected to take place in future periods  due to the company s focus on process improvements and addressing fda compliance requirements 
research and development spending in was primarily focused on the company s core tissue cryopreservation  synergraft  and protein hydrogel technologies 
research and development spending in was primarily focused on the company s synergraft and protein hydrogel technologies 
other costs and expenses goodwill impairment of million in consists of a write down for impairment of goodwill related to the company s tissue processing reporting unit 
this write down was taken in accordance with statement of accounting standards no 
 based on a valuation done by an independent valuation expert 
interest expense decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease was due to the company s reduced average debt balances in as compared to  as a result of scheduled principal payments which reduced the level of outstanding debt  and the company s pay off of the outstanding balance of the term loan in the third quarter of these decreases were partially offset by additional interest expense related to the company s financing of million in insurance premiums associated with the yearly renewal of certain of the company s insurance policies 
interest income decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease was due to the company s reduced average balances of cash and marketable securities during as compared to  as the company sold investments and used cash balances to support ongoing operations and resolve product liability claims 
the company s income tax expense of million in was primarily due to the expense related to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
the effective income tax rate was in  excluding the effects of the valuation allowance  and in seasonality the demand for bioglue appears to experience some seasonality  with a flattening or slight decline in demand generally occurring in the third quarter followed by stronger demand in the fourth quarter 
management believes that this trend for bioglue may be due to fewer surgeries being performed on adult patients in the summer months 
as bioglue is in a growth phase generally associated with a recently introduced product that has not fully penetrated the marketplace  the full nature of any seasonal trends in bioglue sales may be obscured 
the company will continue to evaluate the seasonal nature of bioglue sales 
the demand for the company s cardiovascular tissue preservation services is seasonal  with peak demand generally occurring in the second and third quarters 
management believes this trend for cardiovascular tissue preservation services is primarily due to the high number of surgeries scheduled during the summer months for school aged patients  who drive the demand for a large percentage of cryolife s cardiovascular tissues 
the demand for the company s human vascular and orthopaedic tissue preservation services and bioprosthetic cardiovascular and vascular devices does not appear to experience seasonal trends 
liquidity and capital resources net working capital as of december  net working capital current assets of million less current liabilities of million was million  with a current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities of to  compared to net working capital of million  with a current ratio of to at december  the company s primary capital requirements historically arose out of general working capital needs  capital expenditures for facilities and equipment  and funding of research and development projects  and the company funded those requirements through cash generated by operations  equity offerings  and bank credit facilities 
in recent periods the company s primary requirements for capital have arisen out of working capital needs created by increasing costs of operations and settlements of litigation combined with losses incurred in the company s tissue preservation services business 
operating results have also been negatively impacted by increases in general  administrative  and marketing costs over pre fda order levels  as a result of legal and professional fees and litigation costs 
for the twelve months ended december  the company funded these requirements primarily through existing cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities and through the proceeds from its equity financing  as discussed below 
overall liquidity and capital resources on january  the company s board of directors authorized an agreement with a financial advisory company to sell shares of the company s common stock in a private investment in public equity transaction the pipe 
the pipe was consummated on january   and resulted in the sale of approximately million shares of stock at a price of per share 
the sale generated net proceeds of approximately million  after commissions  filing fees  auditor s fees  attorney s fees  late registration fees  and other related charges  for general corporate purposes 
the company filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec covering the resale of the shares sold in the pipe by the investors 
on november  the company s board of directors authorized the grant of stock to company employees in lieu of annual performance based salary increases and to recognize the performance of certain company executives 
the stock grants totaled  shares of common stock  which were valued at  based on the stock price of on the date of grant 
certain federal and state withholding taxes related to the stock grant were paid by individual employees through deduction of earnings or through payments made in cash or company stock 
the company purchased  in treasury stock from employees to pay employee federal and state withholding taxes related to these stock grants 
on december  the company announced that it had filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec covering the sale from time to time of up to million of its common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  or any combination of these securities for its own account in one or more offerings 
depending on market conditions  the company may sell equity securities pursuant to its form s shelf registration statement in the first half of as of february  no offering of securities had been commenced in accordance with this registration statement  and there can be no assurance any offering will be commenced or consummated 
on february  cryolife and its subsidiaries entered into a new credit agreement with wells fargo foothill  inc as lender 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of million including a letter of credit subfacility of up to an aggregate of million or a borrowing base determined in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement 
generally  the borrowing base is of the appraised value of the business of cryolife  reduced by specified lender reserves 
the credit agreement places limitations on the amount that the company may borrow  and includes various affirmative and negative covenants  including financial covenants such as a requirement that cryolife maintain quarterly i a minimum aggregate borrowing capacity plus cash and cash equivalents  as defined  of million or ii achieve an increasing level of minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda and bioglue gross margins greater than for the preceding twelve months  and cash and cash equivalents  as defined  of million 
while the company expects that its aggregate borrowing availability under the credit agreement will equal million  there can be no assurance that the availability will remain at this level 
the credit agreement also includes customary conditions on incurring new indebtedness and limitations on cash dividends 
cash dividends on any class of capital stock are prohibited  provided that cash dividends on preferred stock may be paid so long as the company maintains million  in the aggregate  of cash  cash equivalents  and borrowing capacity  as defined 
there is no restriction on the payment of stock dividends 
commitment fees are paid based on the unused portion of the facility 
the credit agreement expires on february   at which time the outstanding principal balance will be due 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of cryolife and its subsidiaries 
on february  cryolife borrowed approximately  against the million then available under its revolving credit facility  and used such borrowings to pay certain expenses of the transaction 
the company expects that the following factors will continue to have an adverse impact on cash flows during the anticipated lower preservation services revenues as compared to preservation revenues prior to the fda order  subsequent fda activities  and related events discussed in item business  the high cost of human tissue preservation services as a percent of revenue  as compared to the period prior to the fda order  as a result of lower tissue processing volumes and changes in processing methods  which have increased the cost of processing human tissue and have decreased yields of implantable tissue per donor  an expected use of cash related to the defense and resolution of lawsuits and claims  and the legal and professional costs related to ongoing fda compliance 
the company believes the following factors should have a favorable impact on cash flow from operations during  although there can be no assurance that these factors will be successful expected increases in revenues due to increases in bioglue list prices implemented in january  expected increases in the service fees for cardiovascular and vascular tissues due to fee increases implemented in july and january  to reflect the higher cost of processing these tissues  anticipated improvements in yields of implantable tissues per donor over the levels experienced in and through process changes and process directives  expected increases in procurement of human tissues for processing over the levels experienced in  and anticipated decreases in cash payments related to the defense and resolution of lawsuits and claims from the levels seen in and the company believes that the company s existing cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities will enable the company to meet its liquidity needs through december  additionally  in february the company has entered into a credit agreement  discussed above  and depending on market conditions may sell equity securities pursuant to its form s shelf registration statement in the first half of as of february  no offering of securities had been commenced in accordance with this registration statement  and there can be no assurance any offering will be commenced or consummated 
the company s long term liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the success of bioglue and other products using related technology  the company s ability to increase the level of tissue procurement and demand for its tissue preservation services  the company s ability to reestablish sufficient margins on its tissue preservation services in the face of increased processing costs by improving yields and increasing prices  the company s spending levels on its research and development activities  including research studies  to develop and support its service and product pipeline  the amount and the timing of the resolution of the remaining outstanding product liability lawsuits and other claims see part i 
item legal proceedings  the outcome of other litigation against the company see part i 
item legal proceedings  and to a lesser degree  the company s success at resolving the issues with the fda regarding synergraft processing of human tissue 
if the company is unable to address these issues and continues to experience negative cash flows  the company anticipates that it may require additional financing or seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings  or other sources of capital to meet liquidity and capital requirements beyond december  additional funds may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of december  the company had accrued a total of million for pending product liability claims and  for other litigation and recorded a receivable for million representing the amounts due from insurance companies related to this litigation 
the net million accrual represents the company s portion of the estimated costs  net of insurance recoveries  required to resolve outstanding claims and does not reflect actual settlement arrangements or actual judgments  including punitive damages  which may be assessed by the courts 
these accruals are not cash reserves 
the timing and amount of actual future payments is dependent on when and if judgments are rendered  and or settlements are reached 
should payments related to the accrual be required  the company s portion of these monies would have to be paid from liquid assets 
the company continues to attempt to reach settlements of these outstanding claims in order to minimize the potential cash payout 
see additional discussion of these matters in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the amount and timing of the resolution of the uninsured indemnification claim  if brought see part i 
item legal proceedings  could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and liquidity 
if the company is unable to settle the outstanding product liability claims and other litigation  and any other similar claims that may be brought  for amounts within its ability to pay  or if one or more of the lawsuits in which the company is a defendant should be tried with a substantial verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff s  such verdict s could exceed the company s liquid assets 
there is a possibility that significant punitive damages could be assessed in one or more lawsuits which would have to be paid out of the liquid assets of the company  if available 
in addition  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of december  the company has million in an accrual for the estimated costs of unreported product liability claims related to services performed and products sold prior to december  the company has also recorded a million receivable representing an estimate of amounts due from insurance companies related to unreported product liability claims 
the million accrual does not represent cash set aside 
the timing of future payments related to the accrual is dependent on when and if claims are asserted  judgments are rendered  and or settlements are reached 
should payments related to the accrual be required  these monies would have to be paid from insurance proceeds and liquid assets 
since the amount accrued is based on actuarial estimates  actual amounts required could vary significantly from this estimate 
net cash from operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million  respectively for the twelve months ended december    and the company has experienced operating cash shortfalls in   and due to decreases in revenues as a result of the fda order  overhead costs  including the cost of employees and facilities  which did not decrease in accordance with the reduction in revenues  increases in general and administrative expenditures  primarily due to litigation settlement costs and increased professional fees  and increases in processing costs due to the company s efforts to address the fda s concerns 
these adverse factors were partially offset by the substantial increase in revenues from bioglue  which is a high margin product 
net cash used in was favorably affected by the receipt of approximately million in tax refunds 
the company uses the indirect method to prepare its cash flow statement  and as such the operating cash flows are based on the company s net loss  which is then adjusted to remove non cash items 
for the twelve months ended december   the company s million net loss included significant recurring non cash items that resulted in the company booking an expense without a corresponding cash payment  thereby generating favorable adjustments to the net loss 
these adjustments included million in depreciation and amortization  million in write downs for impairment of deferred preservation costs and inventories  and  in non cash employee compensation consisting of grants of company stock 
in addition  net losses are adjusted by changes in operating asset and liability balances to reflect the timing difference between recording a revenue or expense item and the actual receipt or disbursement of cash 
these adjustments included an unfavorable million due to the timing differences between the recording of receivables and the actual receipt of cash  an unfavorable million due to the buildup of deferred preservation costs and inventories for which vendors and employees have already been paid  a favorable million due to the timing differences associated with prepaid expenses and other assets  and an unfavorable million due to the timing differences between the recording of accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other current liabilities and the actual payment of cash 
the effect of a receipt of million in income tax refunds in the second quarter of for which a receivable had not previously been recorded was largely offset by the recording of a million income tax receivable in the fourth quarter of which is not expected to be received until the company expects that its operations will continue to generate negative cash flows from operating activities during cash used will primarily be a result of the company s projected net loss for significant additional cash payments related to settlements and tissue product costs could have a negative impact on future cash flows 
net cash from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to net cash provided of million for the twelve months ended december  and net cash used of  for the twelve months ended december  the  in current year cash provided was primarily due to million in cash generated from sales and maturities of marketable securities  net of purchases  partially offset by  in capital expenditures 
net cash from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   as compared to net cash used of million for the twelve months ended december  and net cash used of million for the twelve months ended december  the million in current year cash provided was primarily due to million in proceeds from the company s pipe equity offering discussed above and  in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by million in principal payments on short term notes payable and capital leases 
additionally   was used to purchase treasury stock from employees in association with the employee stock grants discussed above 
scheduled contractual obligations and future payments scheduled contractual obligations and the related future payments are as follows in thousands total thereafter capital lease obligations  operating leases      purchase commitments litigation settlement obligations total contractual obligations     the company s capital lease obligations result from the financing of certain of the company s equipment and leasehold improvements primarily purchased during the renovation of the corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities in previous years 
due to cross default provisions included in the company s term loan which was paid in full on august   the company was in default of certain capital lease agreements maintained with the lender under its then outstanding term loan 
therefore  the million due under these capital leases is reflected as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and million as of december  additional capital lease obligations result from the lease of a building related to company s ideas for medicine ifm manufacturing business  which the company sold in the company has a sublease agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of lemaitre vascular  inc  the current parent of ifm  to sublet the building housing the ifm manufacturing facilities  which effectively reduces the company s future obligations under this capital lease to zero 
the company s operating lease obligations result from the lease of land and buildings that comprise the company s corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities  leases related to additional manufacturing  office  and warehouse space rented by the company  leases on company vehicles  and leases on a variety of office equipment 
the company s purchase commitments result from agreements with suppliers to stock certain custom raw materials needed for the company s processing and production 
the company s litigation settlement obligations result from contractual agreements with plaintiffs to resolve outstanding legal matters through the payment of cash settlements 
stock repurchase during the company s board of directors authorized the purchase of shares of its common stock from employees to fund the payment of employee federal and state withholding taxes in association with the grant of stock to employees on november  repurchases of stock from employees in related to these stock grants totaled  no further purchases will be made related to the employee stock grants 
on july  the company s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million in shares of its common stock 
the purchase of shares was to be made from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions on such terms as management deemed appropriate 
as of december  the company had repurchased  shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  and an average price of per share 
this purchase authorization expired during  therefore no further purchases will be made under this authorization 
on march  the company s board of directors authorized the company to purchase up to million shares of its common stock 
as of december   the company had made no purchases under this authorization 
this purchase authorization was rescinded in  therefore no further purchases will be made under this authorization 
capital expenditures the company expects that its capital expenditures in will approximate its expenditures in  which were approximately million 
planned capital expenditures for are primarily related to routine purchases of tissue processing  manufacturing  computer  and office equipment needed to support the company s business 
the company expects to have the flexibility to increase or decrease the majority of its planned capital expenditures depending on its ability to generate cash flows
