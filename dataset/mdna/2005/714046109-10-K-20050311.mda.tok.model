the overall decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to productivity improvements throughout our company  including cost savings we derived from restructuring actions 
restructuring reversals charges  net compared to restructuring charges for were zero versus million of net reversals for the reversals comprised a combination of our changes in estimates of million and our charges of million 
the following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during  and balance at charges amounts paid and incurred changes in estimates balance at charges amounts paid and incurred changes in estimates balance at amounts paid balance at in thousands pre plans q plan q plan q plan q plan total q plan during  we incurred a million restructuring charge in life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics  which we refer to as our q plan 
the purpose of the restructuring was to further improve performance and take advantage of synergies between our former life sciences and analytical instruments businesses which we began integrating in the fourth quarter of the principal actions in this restructuring plan included lower headcount due to the continued integration of the life and analytical sciences business in a european manufacturing and customer care center as well  as headcount reduction at one of the optoelectronics manufacturing facilities to reflect recent declining demand for several product lines 
we planned to reduce headcount by we recorded restructuring charges by segment for as follows in millions life and analytical sciences optoelectronics total q plan this restructuring charge was primarily recorded in the second quarter of however  we recorded additional charges of million and million in the third and fourth quarters of  as required by sfas  as some employees who were notified of their employment termination in the second quarter were required to work for a period of time prior to receiving their severance 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we 
table of contents recorded a pre tax restructuring reversal of million due to fewer employee terminations as a result of higher attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and  accordingly  lower severance costs 
during  we completed all actions under the q plan  with the exception of a headcount reduction of one person that we expect to complete by the second quarter of q plan in connection with our decision to combine our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million during the fourth quarter of  which we refer to as our q plan 
the q plan allowed us to combine many business functions worldwide  with the intention to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses sales  service and research and development organizations 
the principal actions in the q plan included planned workforce reductions of people  closure of approximately facilities and disposal of underutilized assets 
the q plan resulted in the integration of our united states life and analytical sciences sales  service and customer care centers  the integration of european customer care and finance centers  the merging of a former life sciences european manufacturing facility with a former analytical instruments european manufacturing facility  and the merging of a portion of a former life sciences research and development facility in europe with a former analytical instruments facility in europe 
during  we expended million to execute these actions 
in addition  we recorded a reversal of million in the q plan due to fewer terminations as a result of higher than expected employee attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination and lower severance costs for actual terminations 
during  we expended an additional million to execute these actions 
the remaining liability associated with the q plan represents severance related to employees and ongoing lease commitments 
we expect to settle the remaining severance liability by the end of the first quarter of our current estimate is that our lease commitments on unoccupied buildings vary in length but primarily extend until mid q plan during the first quarter of  our management developed a plan to restructure several businesses 
we refer to these activities as our q plan 
the plan resulted in pre tax restructuring charges totaling million 
the principal actions in the q plan included planned workforce and overhead reductions resulting from reorganization activities  including the closure of a manufacturing facility  disposal of underutilized assets and general cost reductions 
q plan charges in our life and analytical sciences segment totaled million 
these charges comprised million in severance costs  million in asset impairments and million in lease commitments 
the charges were a result of actions we took as a response to decreased sales of components in our life and analytical sciences business 
these actions under the charges primarily included the downsizing of an additional manufacturing location and streamlining of the global sales and research and development organizations  primarily in europe  japan and the pacific rim 
we took these actions to reduce the number of employees in components of our business that had experienced declining demand 
q plan charges in our optoelectronics segment totaled million  comprising million in severance costs and million in asset write offs 
this charge was primarily due to the removal of a layer of management structure within our optoelectronics reporting segment which led to a flatter and less expensive organization structure 
total headcount was reduced by 
table of contents during  we recorded a restructuring reversal of million in the q plan primarily due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with our optoelectronics segment 
during  we expended million to complete the remaining actions associated with the q plan 
q plan during the fourth quarter of  in connection with the integration of packard and a restructuring of our sales offices in europe  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in our life and analytical sciences segment and incurred million in charges in we refer to these activities as our q plan 
the principal actions in the q plan included the closing or consolidation of several leased sales and services offices in europe  as well as costs associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in europe  the closure of leased manufacturing facilities in the united states and the disposal of related assets 
in  we recorded an additional pre tax restructuring charge associated with the q plan of million 
this charge was primarily due to additional severance and severance related benefits of the previously identified employees associated with the closure of our european manufacturing facility in the life and analytical sciences segment 
in  we expended million to execute the actions associated with the q plan 
we will pay the remaining balance in for previously identified employees associated with the closure of our european manufacturing facility in the life and analytical sciences segment

the decrease in interest and other expense  net in as compared to  was due primarily to approximately million of lower average outstanding term loan balances combined with lower interest rates applicable to our term loan due to an amendment of our credit facility in the fourth quarter of a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading  liquidity and capital resources 
the remaining decrease in interest and other expense was the result of i swapping million of our notes from fixed rate debt to a floating rate based on six month usd libor in january  resulting in a million decrease in interest expense  and ii million of net interest expense not incurred in as it was related to our zero coupon convertible debentures which we redeemed in the decrease in interest and other expense was partially offset by our increased acceleration of debt issuance costs of million resulting from partial prepayments of our term debt during versus million in we expect interest expense in to decrease due to lower outstanding debt balances and the expected benefit derived from the january swapping of an additional million of our notes from fixed rate debt to a floating rate based on six month usd libor 
compared to interest and other expense  net for was million versus million for  an increase of million or 
the increase in interest and other expense  net in as compared to  was due primarily to higher average borrowing rates resulting from our financing completed in december the remaining increase in interest and other expense  net of million was due primarily to our increased acceleration of the amortization of debt issuance costs of million resulting from partial prepayments of our term debt during versus million in and million of transaction costs we incurred in the fourth quarter of in connection with amending our credit facility to reduce the margin applicable to our term loan 
provision benefit for income taxes compared to the provision for income taxes was million  versus a provision of million in the effective tax rate was as compared to the effective tax rate of 
the change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to million of benefit associated with the resolution of our successful appeal in of an internal revenue service audit finding with respect to our and taxes  additional benefits resulting from the conclusion of canadian and uk tax audits  reduction in state tax expense and our use of existing  and our reduced generation of new  net operating losses 
these benefits were partially offset by an accrual of million for the estimated us tax cost of repatriation calculated under the homeland investment provisions of the american jobs creation act of compared to the provision for income taxes was million  versus a benefit of million in our effective tax rate was as compared to our effective tax rate of 
the change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a relatively high ratio in of permanent tax differences to loss from continuing operations before income taxes 

table of contents discontinued operations we recorded the following gains and losses  which we report as the loss on dispositions of discontinued operations  during the years ended january  and december  in thousands loss on electroformed products business loss on computer to plate business gain on the resolution of contingencies associated with the technical services business loss on the sale of the security and detection systems business loss on entertainment lighting business loss on telecommunications component business net loss on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes loss on disposition of discontinued operations  net of income taxes as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities  in june  we approved a plan to shut down our electroformed products business and sell our ultraviolet lighting business 
in september  we approved a plan to shut down our computer to plate business 
we previously had reported the results of all three of these businesses as part of the optoelectronics reporting segment 
we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
and  accordingly  have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as part of discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying balance sheets as of january  and december  the net assets of the electroformed products business were written off resulting in a million pre tax loss for the year ended january  we sold the fixed assets and inventory of the ultraviolet lighting business in july for their approximate book value 
the abandonment of the computer to plate business resulted in a million write down of fixed assets and inventory which we recognized in our loss on dispositions for the year ended january  during and  we settled various claims under certain long term contracts and transition services with our technical services business  which we sold in august the net settlement and the reversal of certain previously established contingencies resulted in pre tax gains of million in and million in that are included in gain loss on dispositions of discontinued operations 
we reversed contingencies in the period in which the related issues were resolved 
we may increase or reverse remaining contingencies in the future  pending resolution of the underlying matters 
in june  we completed the sale of our security and detection systems business for cash consideration of approximately million and a net working capital adjustment 
we recorded a net pre tax gain of approximately million pursuant to this transaction in as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations 
we accounted for our security and detection systems business as a discontinued operation in accordance with apb no 
 and accordingly  the results of operations and related cash flows of this business through the disposal date were segregated from continuing operations and reported as a separate line on our consolidated income statements 
we have presented the resulting gain from the sale as a component of net income within dispositions of discontinued operations  net of income tax on our consolidated income statement 
adjustments relating to this sale resulted in a pre tax loss from discontinued operations of million in  primarily due to revised estimates of the working capital adjustment 
in june  our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our telecommunications components business as of june  and a plan to sell our entertainment lighting business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities 
we have reflected both businesses as discontinued operations in

summary operating results of the discontinued operations of the security and detection systems  telecommunications component  entertainment lighting  electroformed products  ultraviolet lighting and computer to plate businesses for the periods prior to disposition were as follows in thousands sales costs and expenses operating loss from discontinued operations other expense loss from discontinued operations before income taxes benefit from income taxes loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes effect of accounting change as required by sfas  we completed the transitional impairment analysis of our recorded goodwill as of january  in connection with the adoption of this standard  we reviewed our forecasts and projections of all of our reporting units and determined that  based on decreased demand for certain specialty lamps resulting from a downturn in the printed circuit board production worldwide and other smaller markets  the fair value of the lighting reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
with the assistance of valuation specialists and using a discounted cash flow model  we determined that the carrying value of the recorded goodwill was in excess of the fair value of that goodwill 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge totaling million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
the entire transition adjustment related to our lighting reporting unit within our optoelectronics reporting segment 
in addition  as part of our ongoing compliance with sfas no 
 we completed our annual assessment of goodwill using a measurement date of january  this annual assessment did not result in an impairment charge 
acquisitions and divestitures in february  we acquired elcos ag  a leading european designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode  or led  solutions for biomedical and industrial applications 
the transaction combines elcos visible led technology platform and strong customer and application base with our global sales  application and support organization  therefore expanding the sales growth opportunities for the elcos technology 
consideration for the transaction was approximately million in cash at the time of closing with additional consideration of approximately million due through fiscal in addition  potential earn out payments of up to approximately million may be made based on the future performance of the business 
in november  we completed our acquisition of packard bioscience company 
the integration activities are complete with the exception of million in remaining payments due on leased facilities exited in that will be paid through these integration activities are linked to the q plan and are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 

table of contents the following table summarizes integration reserve activity during  and related to the acquisition of packard severance abandonment of excess facilities total cash charges asset impairment total in millions packard integration plan balance at december  amounts paid balance at december  amounts paid balance at january  contingencies we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and  along with other companies  have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites 
we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we have accrued million as of january   representing our management s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters 
this amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements 
these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables  including the stage of the environmental investigations  the magnitude of the possible contamination  the nature of the potential remedies  possible joint and several liability  the timeframe over which remediation may occur  and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations 
for sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party  our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute 
we expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years 
as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site  these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available 
there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
while it is possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may be incurred  we do not expect the potential exposure to be materially different from the amounts we recorded 
we and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit filed in july  and we and certain officers and directors have been named as defendants in purported derivative lawsuits filed in june and july the plaintiffs in all of these suits have alleged  among other things  various statements made by the company and management  during the same time period for all three suits  were misleading with respect to our prospects and future operating results 
further information with respect to these lawsuits is contained in part i  item legal proceedings of this annual report 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and are contesting the actions vigorously 
we are currently unable  however  to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss  if any  that may result from the resolution of these matters 
we previously received a notice from the internal revenue service asserting federal income tax deficiencies for and the company and the internal revenue service resolved these matters in as a result of the settlement  we have reversed the reserves of million that had been established in accordance with fas based on our previous assessment of the resolution of these matters  which assessment was less favorable than the ultimate outcome 
we are under regular examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities in the united states and other countries  such as canada  finland  and the united kingdom  and states in which we have significant business operations  such as california and new york 
the tax years under examination vary by 
table of contents jurisdiction  for example  the irs is currently examining through assuming current progress  we expect the irs examination to be completed in fiscal we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years examinations 
tax reserves have been established  which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments 
once established  reserves are adjusted as information becomes available and when an event occurs requiring a change to the reserves 
the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition  although such settlement could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and consolidated statement of income for a particular future period

interest rates under the senior credit facility applicable to the term loan and to the revolving credit facility are determined as a margin over either the eurodollar rate or the base rate 
the base rate is the higher of the corporate base rate announced from time to time by bank of america  na and the federal funds rate plus basis points 
the applicable margins for the term loan and the revolving credit facility vary based upon our leverage ratio at the end of the prior quarter 
the applicable margin as of january  was basis points for the eurodollar rate and basis points for the base rate 
we may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the senior credit facility to interest based upon the margin over the eurodollar rate or the base rate 
at 
table of contents january   the eurodollar rate was approximately basis points and the base rate was basis points resulting in a eurodollar interest rate on the senior credit facility of basis points 
in october  we amended our senior credit facility to allow greater flexibility regarding acquisitions  stock repurchases  debt reduction and cash repatriation 
the amount of permitted acquisitions and any related indebtedness was raised from million to million 
the amount of indebtedness related to acquisitions is subject to compliance with all financial covenants 
the term loan is repayable in mandatory nominal quarterly installments of million of the outstanding balance until december  and thereafter in four equal quarterly installments of of the then outstanding balance until december additionally  annual principal payments as a percentage of excess cash flow  defined as a ratio based on our cash flow and leverage ratio in the credit agreement  are payable six months following the end of each fiscal year 
we are not required to make any such principal payment in  with respect to our excess cash flow 
in  we made million in principal payments on the term loan 
the revolving credit facility is available to us through december for our working capital needs 
at no point in fiscal nor at any other time  did we have any outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility 
our senior credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specific financial ratios  including a minimum interest coverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum senior leverage ratio  and a maximum total leverage ratio 
as of january   and at all other times during fiscal  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
notes 
in december  we issued and sold ten year senior subordinated notes at a rate of with a face value of million 
we received million in gross proceeds from the issuance 
we recorded deferred issuance costs of million as a non current asset 
the debt  which matures in january  is unsecured but is guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries 
interest on our notes is payable semi annually on january and july in january  we swapped the fixed rate on million of these notes to a floating rate using swap instruments which reset semi annually in arrears based upon six month usd libor and an applicable spread as defined in the swap agreements 
in january  we swapped an additional million of these notes from fixed rate to floating rate at similar terms to the january swap  and therefore we now pay the applicable six month usd libor rate  plus the applicable spread  on million of our obligations represented by the notes 
if a change of control of our company occurs  each holder of notes may require us to repurchase some or all of its notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest 
before january   we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount with the net proceeds of specified public equity offerings at of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest  if at least of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding after the redemption 
we may redeem some or all of our notes at any time on or after january   at a redemption price of 
the redemption price decreases to on january   to on january  and to on january  the debt is subordinated to our senior credit facility 
these notes contain financial and other covenants 
most of these covenants terminate if the notes obtain an investment grade rating by standard poor s rating services and moody s investors service 
at january   and at all times during fiscal  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
zero coupon convertible debentures 
through the first quarter of  we repurchased million in accreted amount of our zero coupon convertible debentures due in open market purchases and through a 
table of contents december tender offer 
we redeemed the remaining million of accreted value of zero coupon debentures on august  in accordance with their terms 
we used approximately million held in escrow pursuant to the terms of our senior secured credit facility along with available cash of approximately million  to redeem the zero coupon convertible debentures 
as of december  the zero coupon convertible debentures had been fully retired 
notes 
in december  we initiated a tender offer for all of our outstanding notes 
we completed the tender offer and repurchased all but million of these notes as of december  we paid consent payments pursuant to a consent solicitation we made concurrently with the tender offer 
the consent solicitation eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our notes as of december  we may from time to time repurchase outstanding notes through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
the remaining million in notes are due to be paid in october off balance sheet arrangements receivables securitization facility in december  we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to purchase  on a revolving basis  certain of our accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial institution 
in september  we amended the facility to increase total funding capacity from million to million to expand our sources of liquidity 
amounts funded under this facility were million at both january  and december  as of january   we had approximately million of undrawn capacity available under the facility 
the facility had an effective interest rate of approximately libor plus basis points as of january  the facility includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of bb or above  as defined by standard poor s rating services  and ba or above  as defined by moody s investors service 
at january   we had a senior unsecured credit rating of bb with a stable outlook from standard poor s rating services  and of ba with a positive outlook from moody s investors service 
the facility expires on january  dividends our board of directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of and  resulting in an annual dividend rate of cents per share 
our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding senior subordinated notes contain restrictions that may limit our ability to pay our regular quarterly cash dividend in the future if we are unable to comply with certain financial covenants that primarily relate to cash flow 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january  operating leases unsecured notes due term note sr 
subordinated notes due other revolving debt facilities total in thousands and beyond total 
table of contents capital expenditures during  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million to million primarily to introduce new products  to improve our operating processes  to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations  and to capitalize expenses related to internally developed information technology 
we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 
future accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb no 
r  share based payment 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the statement requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards  with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we expect to adopt sfas no 
r using the statement s modified prospective application method 
we expect our adoption of sfas no 
r to increase stock compensation expense 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our financial results 
on november   the fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are evaluating the potential impact  if any  the adoption of statement will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  we recognize product revenue upon delivery  and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met 
we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element  all in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
because the majority of our sales relate to specific 
table of contents manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects  we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates 
further  we have not experienced any significant product returns or refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible  and specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would reduce our earnings 
inventory valuation 
we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture 
we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost 
generally  reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and  when necessary  record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product 
if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels  we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
this would reduce our earnings 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
we carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment  investments  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based  in part  upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
we undertake this review on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets and on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings 
the initial assessment of goodwill recoverability under sfas no 
resulted in a million charge to our earnings 
this charge  relating to goodwill in our lighting reporting unit within our optoelectronics business segment  was caused by expected declines in profitability and cash flows as a result of softness in key end markets 
we completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill for and and concluded that there was no impairment 
while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
in addition  we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not being amortized at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the useful life of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite  the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
employee compensation and benefits 
retirement and post retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
we incurred expenses of million in  million in and million in for our retirement and post retirement plans 
we expect expenses of approximately million in for our retirement and post retirement plans 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or 
table of contents expense for the year 
as of january   we estimated the expected long term rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was percent  and was percent for plans outside the united states 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets 
our management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
discount rate assumptions have been  and continue to be based on the prevailing market long term interest rates at the measurement date 
if any of our assumptions were to change  our pension plan expenses would also change 
a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pre tax pension expense by million for in the united states and by million for for all plans outside the united states 
we have reduced the volatility in our health care costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature 
under the defined dollar plan feature  our total annual liability for health care costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount  regardless of the nature or cost of the health care needs of that retiree 
our maximum future liability therefore  cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of health care 
restructuring activities 
our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals 
our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of severance benefits to be granted to employees  based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub rental income and asset impairments as discussed above under value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention 
for example  actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected 
in addition  unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates 
when such changes in estimates occur  they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled restructuring charges  net 
gains or losses on dispositions 
when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation  we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition 
this estimate is based on a variety of factors  including current interest in the market  alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors 
if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we record a loss 
if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated 
accordingly  we may realize amounts different than were first estimated 
during the year ended january   we recognized million in losses from disposition of a business and excess facilities 
we also recorded million in losses from the disposition of discontinued operations comprised of gains from the final disposition of our telecommunications components and technical services businesses 
these gains were offset by losses associated with the disposition of our electroformed products and computer to plate businesses 
any such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our income statement 
income taxes 
our business operations are global in nature  and we are subject to taxes in more than countries 
tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries 
we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law 
our tax provision contemplates tax rates in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax position 
any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change 
such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 
our tax positions are consistently subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world 
where appropriate  we reserve for tax matters where we believe that there is a significant likelihood of an 
table of contents incremental liability being incurred 
any significant changes as a result of changes in underlying facts  law  tax rates  tax audit or review could lead to adjustments in our effective tax rate or cash flow 
in addition  we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits and other credits 
valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to ultimately use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed to be recoverable 
improvements or other changes in our operations  domestically and internationally  could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future 
the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 
the fasb also issued fasb staff position  or fsp  no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of the american jobs creation act introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of specified foreign earnings to a us taxpayer  provided criteria are met 
fsp provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
until the treasury department or congress provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision  the total amount of foreign earnings to be repatriated by us cannot be determined and the presumption that such unremitted earnings will not be repatriated cannot be overcome 
fsp grants an enterprise additional time beyond the year ended december   in which the act was enacted  to evaluate the effects of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted earnings 
fsp calls for enhanced disclosures of  among other items  the status of a company s evaluations  the effects of completed evaluations  and the potential range of income tax effects of repatriations 
such disclosures are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking information and factors affecting future performance the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations economic  political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales 
because we sell our products worldwide  our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our sales originating outside the united states represented more than of our total sales in the fiscal year ended january  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales 
in addition  many of our manufacturing facilities  employees and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in developing or emerging markets  longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  differing tax laws and changes in those laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor laws and changes in those laws  differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection  and differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements 

table of contents if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner  our products could become obsolete and our operating results would suffer 
we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product and service introductions  and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements  our products could become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our sales and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors  including our ability to accurately anticipate customer needs  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time  and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 
many of our products are used by our customers to develop  test and manufacture their products 
therefore  we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products 
in developing new products  we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product 
if we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities  we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales 
in addition  some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions  which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 
for example  some of our license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research  and exclude clinical diagnostics applications 
our debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities 
as of january   we had approximately million in outstanding indebtedness 
we have million in additional borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility and million under our receivable securitization program 
we may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs  which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 
our leverage could have negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through acquisitions or licensing  and limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industries in which we compete 
approximately million of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates pursuant to the terms of the original agreements 
however  after giving effect to the interest rate swaps entered into in january and january  approximately million of our indebtedness now bears interest at floating rates 
as a result  our interest payment obligations on this indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase 
our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
our business may not 
table of contents generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy 
if we are unable to service our debt and fund our business  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or research and development expenditures  seek additional financing or equity capital  restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us or at all 
restrictions in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our notes may limit our activities 
our senior credit facility and the indenture relating to our notes contain  and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain  restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company  including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on  redeem or repurchase our capital stock  make investments  create liens  sell assets  in the case of our restricted subsidiaries  incur obligations that restrict their ability to make dividend or other payments to us  in the case of our restricted subsidiaries  guarantee or secure indebtedness  enter into transactions with affiliates  create unrestricted subsidiaries  and consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility 
our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance  which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors  including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates  interest rates  changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 
our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument  which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date 
also  an acceleration of the debt under our senior credit facility would trigger an event of default under our notes  and a default under our notes would trigger an event of default under the senior credit facility and possibly other debt 
if an event of default occurs  we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under our indebtedness 
if we are unable to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility  those lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell the collateral that secures our borrowings under that agreement 
our inability to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility may also cause a default under other of our obligations including our accounts receivable securitization facility 
our operating results may could be harmed by cyclical downturns affecting several of the industries into which we sell our products 
some of the industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical 
industry downturns are often characterized by reduced product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of average selling 
table of contents prices and profits 
in the past  significant downturns in our customers markets and in general economic conditions have resulted in a reduced demand for several of our products and have hurt our operating results 
for example  during  our operating results were reduced by downturns in many of the markets we serve  including the pharmaceutical  biomedical  semiconductor and aerospace markets 
our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation  and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability 
changes in competitive  market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations  and we may not be able to make those adjustments or to make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter 
factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include demand for and market acceptance of our products  competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business  adverse changes in industries  such as pharmaceutical  biomedical  semiconductors and aerospace  on which we are particularly dependent  changes in the portions of our sales represented by our various products and customers  delays or problems in the introduction of new products  our competitors announcement or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  and changes in the volume or timing of product orders 
we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies  integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing business or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable 
we have in the past  and may in the future  supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines  such as our acquisition of elcos ag in february however  we may be unable to identify  complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons  including competition among buyers and licensees  the need for regulatory and other approvals  our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions  the high valuations of businesses and technologies  and restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness  including the indenture governing our notes and our new senior credit facility 
some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable 
accordingly  the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings 
for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability  we must improve their management  operations  products and market penetration 
we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations  such as incompatible management  information or other systems or cultural differences 

table of contents to finance our acquisitions  we may have to raise additional funds  either through public or private financings 
we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us 
if we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights  we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage 
we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology  we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products  redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage 
potential competitors could in license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 
our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations 
if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license  such as the right to exclusivity in a market 
in some cases  we could lose all rights under the license 
in addition  rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control 
for example  the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons  including invalidity of the licensed patent  or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 
if we do not compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business 
we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors 
to remain competitive  we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products 
we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors  technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 
if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies  we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
some of the products produced by our life and analytical sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar international agencies 
in addition  some of the activities of our fluid sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the united states federal aviation administration 
these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities  from design and development to labeling  manufacturing  promotion  sales  resales and distribution 
if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies  we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution 
we had to do this on a temporary basis in in response to an fda directive at one of our life and analytical sciences locations until we were able to resolve the matter by implementing additional testing and labeling conditions on the relevant product 
in addition  we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 
we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal  state  local and foreign regulations  such as environmental  health and safety  and food and drug regulations 
we develop  configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations 
any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 
obtaining and enforcing patent protection for our proprietary products  processes and technologies may be difficult and expensive  we may infringe intellectual property rights of third parties 
patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing and marketing new technologies and products is time consuming and expensive 
we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to 
table of contents apply for additional patents to cover our products 
we may not obtain issued patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us 
the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology 
third parties may seek to challenge  invalidate or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to us or claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
in addition to our patents  we possess an array of unpatented proprietary technology and know how and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties 
the measures that we employ to protect this technology and these rights may not be adequate 
moreover  in some cases  the licensor can terminate a license or convert it to a non exclusive arrangement if we fail to meet specified performance targets 
we may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties 
in addition  claims of third parties against us  such as the pending actions by  respectively  enzo biochem  inc and enzo life sciences  inc  and by amersham biosciences corp 
and amersham plc  could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing  using  importing or selling our products in the united states or abroad 
our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 
as of january   our total assets included billion of net intangible assets 
net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights  trademark rights and technology licenses  net of accumulated amortization 
we test these items on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned 
adverse changes in our business or the failure to grow our life and analytical sciences business may result in impairment of our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  marketable securities and accounts receivable 
we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of january  in the ordinary course of business  we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
transactions covered by hedge contracts include inter company and third party receivables and payables 
the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies  have maturities that do not exceed months  have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions 
unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and  for hedges designated as cash flow  the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs 
for the year ended january   we did not engage in any designated cash flow hedges 
the notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately million at january  and million as of december   and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant 
the duration of the foreign currency derivative contracts was generally days for

we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk 
as a multinational corporation  we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures can take a variety of different forms as our international sales grow  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial results 
reported sales made in foreign currencies by our international subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  can fluctuate due to exchange rate movements 
while exchange rate fluctuations can impact reported revenues and earnings  this impact is purely a result of the translation effect and does not materially impact our short term cash flows 
in all parts of the world our subsidiaries  on occasion  invoice third party customers in foreign currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business 
we refer to our subsidiaries primary business currencies as the functional currencies 
movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency result in both realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses that directly impact our cash flows and our results of operations 
our manufacturing and distribution organization is worldwide 
accordingly  inventories may be manufactured in one location  stored in another  and distributed in a third location 
this results in a wide array of intercompany transactions transactions that are billed and paid in many different currencies 
our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore directly impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates of currencies involved 
the cash flow needs of each of our foreign subsidiaries vary through time 
accordingly  there may be times when a subsidiary lends to or borrows from either the parent company or another affiliate 
these advances  again being denominated in currencies other than a particular entity s functional currency  can expose it to fluctuations in exchange rates that can impact both our cash flows and results of operations 
in order to repay debt or satisfy operational needs  we may remit cash from our foreign locations to the united states 
when this occurs  we are liquidating foreign currency net asset positions and converting them into united states dollars 
our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore also impacted by these transactions 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes 
we specifically use forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated assets and liabilities and use a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows 
our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
the success of our hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
the principal currencies we hedge are the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  japanese yen  and singapore dollar 
in those currencies where there is a liquid  cost effective forward market  we maintain hedge coverage between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure 
foreign currency risk value at risk disclosure we utilize a value at risk model to determine the potential earning fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments 
as discussed above  we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program 
our value at risk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation  utilizing a confidence interval and a holding period of days 
as of january   this computation estimated that there is a chance that the market value of the 
table of contents underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than million 
this value at risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program 
specifically  during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal  the value at risk ranged between million and million  and averaged approximately million 
interest rate risk 
as described above  our debt portfolio includes both fixed rate and variable rate instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows  as they relate to interest  and our earnings 
in january and january  we effected  for a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio  interest rate swaps that in effect convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
these swaps have been designated as fair value hedges 
these swaps are marked to market in our consolidated financial statements 
the fair value movements in these swaps are offset by the fair value movement in the debt 
interest rate risk sensitivity as of january   our debt portfolio was comprised of million fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt 
after giving effect to the interest rate swaps entered into in january and january  million of our debt portfolio is fixed and million is variable 
in addition  our cash and cash equivalents  for which we receive interest at variable rates  were million at january  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt comprised of million of term loan and million of swapped notes to fluctuate 
a increase  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause an additional pre tax charge to our earnings of million for fiscal year changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate 
as described above  an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by million for fiscal year changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest received to fluctuate 
changes in interest rates can cause the value of our fixed rate debt to change 
however  such a value change has no impact on either our earnings or our cash flows unless we determine that we wish to retire this debt in the open market
