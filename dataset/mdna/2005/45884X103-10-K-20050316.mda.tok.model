item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for additional overview information relating to our business  including our marketed products  co promotion and product development  please see the discussion in item business overview  which is incorporated herein by reference 
significant license acquisition agreements we are highly dependent on technology we license or acquire from third parties 
all of our currently marketed products are subject to license or acquisition agreements with third parties 
the majority of our clinical development pipeline is also based on technology that we have licensed from third parties 
details of these agreements can be found elsewhere in this report under the headings license and other agreements  results of operations and notes and to our financial statements 
we will be required to make contingent milestone payments in accordance with all our license and acquisition agreements in the aggregate amount of million if all of the milestones defined in each of the agreements are achieved 
these milestones include development  regulatory approval  commercialization and sales milestones 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these estimates are the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  which in turn may impact our reported revenue and expenses 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially change the financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and revenue reserves revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  and final delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we sell to a limited number of customers  mainly specialty pharmacies and distributors 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price 
revenue is recognized at delivery when title passes to a credit worthy customer and reserves are recorded for estimated returns  rebates  chargebacks and cash discounts 
we are obligated to accept from customers the return of pharmaceuticals that have reached their expiration date 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on historical experience 
due to the nature of our business model and based on historical experience  these estimates are not highly subjective 
we review all sales transactions for potential rebates  chargebacks and discounts each month and monitor product ordering cycles and actual returns  product expiration dates and wholesale inventory levels to estimate potential product return rates 
we believe that our reserves are adequate 
accounting for intangible assets our intangible assets are comprised principally of acquired technology rights 
we apply judgments to determine the useful lives of our intangible assets and whether such assets are impaired 
factors we consider include the life of the underlying patent  the expected period of benefit from the use of the technology  the existence of competing technology and potential obsolescence 
we review intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flow we expect the assets to generate 
the assumptions we use in determining cash flows attributable to our intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying business 
in making these estimates  we are required to make judgments as to the future revenue and expenses generated by the asset 
the assumptions and estimates we use when determining the fair value of long lived assets are highly subjective due to the forward looking nature of these estimates 
in some cases we are required to estimate cash flows related to a particular long lived asset for up to years 
please refer to the statements under the heading risk factors in this report to gain a better understanding of the possible reasons why actual results could differ from our estimates 
we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated undiscounted future cash flow we expect to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds we expect from the disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
when we identify an impairment  we reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or  when available and appropriate  comparable market values 
clinical trial accruals we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with contract research organizations and review of contractual terms 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
to date  we have not experienced changes in estimates that have led to material research and development expense being recorded in future periods 
non cancelable purchase obligations for inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and our inventory costs are determined by the first in first out method 
we enter into non cancelable purchase obligations to purchase our inventory based upon sales forecasts to enable us to mitigate some of the risk associated with the long lead times required to manufacture our products 
at december   our minimum purchase obligations totaled million and are committed through the year of these commitments  we have and million of outstanding fixed purchase order commitments that become due and payable in and  respectively 
we write off the cost of inventory and reserve for future minimum purchase commitments that we consider to be in excess of forecasted future demand 
we define excess inventory as inventory that will expire before it can be sold  based on future sales forecasts 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory levels 
we are also required to make judgments as to the expiration dates of our products  since our products can no longer be used after their respective expiration dates 
as part of our excess inventory assessment for all of our products  we also estimate the expiration dates of our products to be manufactured in the future 
projected revenue trends resulted in us recording charges during for excess inventories and non cancelable purchase obligations 
if revenue levels experienced in future quarters are substantially below our expectations  especially those revenues from sales of actimmune and or infergen  we could be required to record additional charges for excess inventories and or non cancelable purchase obligations 
for the year ended december   we recorded a total of million to cost of goods for excess inventory  which included a million reserve of non cancelable purchase obligations 
please refer to the statements under the heading risk factors in this report to gain a better understanding of the possible reasons why actual results could differ from our estimates 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and the following table presents our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   the change in dollars and the percentage change when compared to the year ended december  year ended change from december  increase decrease amount in thousands  except percentages revenue  net actimmune infergen other total revenue  net costs and expenses cost of goods sold excludes amortization and impairment of acquired product rights amortization and impairment of acquired product rights research and development selling  general and administrative acquired research and development and milestone payments total costs and expenses loss from operations interest income interest expense other expense net loss revenue for the year ended december   intermune recorded total net revenue of million  compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of 
net sales of actimmune for were million  compared to million for  a decline of 
net sales of infergen were million for the year ended compared to million in the same period of  an increase of 
for the years ended december  and  actimmune accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total net revenue  and substantially all of these sales were derived from physicians prescriptions for the off label use of actimmune in the treatment of ipf 
actimmune sales declined during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in due to a decrease in the underlying demand for actimmune 
we believe that the rate of patient referrals by physicians and the average duration of therapy are among the key uncertainties that affect demand for actimmune and our actimmune revenue and total product revenue 
the patient referral rate reflects the number of new patients who are prescribed actimmune and who call the call center that coordinates with all of our specialty distributors  although these patients may elect not to have those prescriptions filled 
we believe that the following factors are among those that may affect the patient referral rate for actimmune physician screening of patients who are likely to pursue treatment with actimmune  physician or patient interest  the publication of the results of our initial phase iii ipf clinical trial  gipf  in the new england journal of medicine and the negative editorial that accompanied the publication  and the extent to which physicians enroll their patients in our phase iii ipf clinical trial  gipf  who would otherwise be put on actimmune therapy 
during the year ended december   the patient referral rate that we observed for actimmune was significantly lower than for the same period in  however  the average duration of therapy that we observed was greater than expected 
infergen sales increased during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in due to marketing and sales programs initiated in also  infergen demand in terms of vials dispensed grew in compared to we believe the difference between infergen s annual revenue growth of and the reported annual demand growth of is the result of two factors price increases during the year  which ranged from to on various package sizes  and the establishment of several new infergen distribution agreements with specialty pharmacies 
as is customary in the industry  inventory stocking follows new distribution agreements and we believe these agreements resulted in an additional two to three weeks of infergen inventory worth million to million in cost of goods sold cost of goods sold included product manufacturing costs  royalties and distribution costs associated with our revenues and inventory reserves 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  approximately of total net revenue  compared to million  or approximately of total net revenue  in the corresponding period of the increase in cost of goods sold primarily reflects a charge of million taken for obsolete inventory and contractual purchase commitments in excess of our present forecasts compared to million in and a shift in the mix of product sales toward a higher proportion of infergen revenue 
exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases may adversely affect cost of goods sold on actimmune inventory purchased from bi austria 
we utilize forward exchange contracts to partially offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations 
amortization and impairment of acquired product rights we recorded amortization and impairment of acquired product rights for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
the acquired product rights related to the acquisition of amphotec  infergen and interferon gamma b patents 
the decrease for the period versus the same period in was primarily due to a charge of million taken in the third quarter of for the impairment of amphotec product rights which reduced the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset being amortized 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million or 
the decrease in was largely attributable to the focusing of our r d investment for clinical trials in the areas of hepatology and pulmonology and discontinuing a number of programs outside of these two core areas  particularly anti infectives 
the following table lists our current product development programs and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each program during the indicated periods 
the category titled programs non specific is comprised of facilities and personnel costs that are not allocated to a specific development program or discontinued programs 
our management reviews each of these program categories in evaluating our business 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with developing our products  as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with potential commercialization of our product candidates  see the clinical development is a long  expensive and uncertain process  and delay or failure can occur at any stage of any of our clinical trials  we do not know whether our planned clinical trials will begin on time  or at all  or will be completed on schedule  or at all  preclinical development is a long  expensive and uncertain process  and we may terminate one or more of our current preclinical development programs  if our clinical trials fail to demonstrate to the fda and foreign regulatory authorities that any of our products or product candidates are safe and effective for the treatment of particular diseases  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may require us to conduct additional clinical trials or may not grant us marketing approval for such products or product candidates for those diseases  the manufacturing and manufacturing development of our products and product candidates present technological  logistical and regulatory risks  each of which may adversely affect our potential revenues  our manufacturing strategy  which relies on third party manufacturers  exposes us to additional risks as a result of which we may lose potential revenues and we rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials for our products and product candidates  and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily sections  as well as other sections under business risk factors above 
development program in thousands pulmonology hepatology oncology anti infectives programs non specific total includes amounts related to oritavancin and amphotec  a substantial majority of the expenses related to oritavancin 
the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investments in research and development and  in particular  the clinical development of our product pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  the filing with the fda of an ind to conduct human clinical trials for drugs  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use  and the filing by a company and acceptance and approval by the fda of an nda or bla for a drug product to allow commercial distribution of the drug 
in light of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million 
the increased spending for the year ended december  versus the same period in was primarily associated with the increased investment in the infergen brand including the creation of a new infergen sales force of sales representatives in the fourth quarter of and increased compensation  recruiting and consulting expenses associated with our therapeutic refocus and rebuilding initiatives 
acquired research and development and milestone payments there were no charges for acquired research and development and milestone payments in the year ended december  we recorded charges of million for acquired research and development and milestone payments for the year ended december  these charges related to milestone expenses recognized as a result of the commencement of a phase i clinical trial for peg alfacon and the lilly milestone for oritavancin 
we expensed these amounts as acquired research and development and milestone payments as peg alfacon and oritavancin are currently in clinical development  have not reached technical feasibility and have no foreseeable alternative future uses 
interest income interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the comparable period ended december  the decrease in interest income in the year ended december  reflects declining investment funds in our cash and short term investments throughout the year 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense in the year ended december  reflects the repurchase of all of our million convertible subordinated notes due in mid  and the impact of the lower interest rate on our million convertible senior notes 
other expense other expense of million for the year ended december  includes a charge of million for the repurchase of all million of our convertible subordinated notes due in july  and the accelerated amortization of million of the deferred issuance costs associated with these notes 
also  included in other expense for the year ended december  is a million foreign currency exchange loss on our unhedged foreign currency payables for inventory and clinical material purchases from bi austria at year end 
provision for income taxes due to our continuing operating losses and the uncertainty of our recognizing the potential future benefits from these losses  we recorded no provision or benefit for income taxes for the years ended december  and as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
we also have federal research and development tax credits of approximately million that will expire in the years through in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million  that expire in the years through  and state research and development tax credits of approximately million that do not expire 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
comparison of years ended december  and the following table presents our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   the change in dollars and the percentage change when compared to the year ended december  year ended change from december  increase decrease amount in thousands  except percentages revenue  net actimmune infergen other total revenue  net costs and expenses cost of goods sold excludes amortization and impairment of acquired product rights amortization and impairment of acquired product rights research and development selling  general and administrative acquired research and development and milestone payments total costs and expenses loss from operations interest income interest expense other expense net loss revenue total product revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the growth in product sales for the year ended december  was primarily due to a volume increase in sales of actimmune of million or  and a volume increase in sales of infergen of million or 
our revenues experienced fluctuations during the year due to market and physician acceptance and use of our products  influenced by published reports in medical journals  reimbursement policies of major insurance companies  revised treatment guidelines and the rate of patient enrollment in our inspire trial for actimmune 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of goods sold included manufacturing costs  royalties and distribution costs associated with our revenues 
the increase in cost of goods sold in was due primarily to costs associated with increased product sales volumes 
the cost of goods sold  as a percentage of revenues  were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue in  when compared to  was primarily due to reserves included in cost of goods sold for in the amount of million for excess infergen and amphotec inventory and due to the mix of products sold during amortization and impairment of acquired product rights we recorded amortization and impairment of acquired product rights of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the charges recorded in and were comprised of the amortization charges related to the acquisition of amphotec and infergen product rights and interferon gamma b patents 
the charges also included a charge of million for the impairment of amphotec product rights recognized during the million impairment charge reduced the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset that we recorded in when we acquired amphotec 
this impairment charge was based on our impairment review of the amphotec product rights  which took into account that sales levels were lower than expected  and that amphotec is not aligned with our new strategic focus in pulmonology and hepatology 
consequently  we decided to divest amphotec and are currently in the early stages of a competitive process to identify a partner that has the ability to maximize the value of the asset 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million or 
the decrease in  when compared to  was primarily due to lower spending in the areas of pulmonology and hepatology offset in part by increased spending in the areas of oncology and anti infectives 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million or 
the increased spending in was primarily due to increased legal  insurance  compensation and recruiting expenses totaling million offset in part by lower non cash compensation charges 
acquired research and development and milestone payments we recorded charges for acquired research and development and milestone payments of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we recorded charges for acquired research and development and milestone payments of million primarily due to a milestone based liability under our agreement with eli lilly for the completion of the phase iii clinical trial of oritavancin for complicated skin and skin structure infections  and a million charge related to milestone payments primarily due to our license and commercialization agreement with amgen as a result of the commencement of a phase i clinical trial for peg alfacon we expensed both of these charges as acquired research and development and milestone payments as oritavancin and peg alfacon were in clinical development  had not reached technical feasibility and had no foreseeable alternative future uses as of december  in  we entered into license agreement for pirfenidone with marnac and kdl 
at the time of the product acquisition from marnac and kdl  pirfenidone was in phase ii clinical development for certain fibrotic diseases of the lung  heart  kidney and liver 
under the terms of the agreement  we received an exclusive license from marnac and kdl in exchange for an up front cash payment of million and future milestone and royalty payments 
we expensed the million as acquired research and development and milestone payments as pirfenidone was in clinical development  had not reached technical feasibility and had no foreseeable alternative future uses at the time of acquisition 
also in  we paid eli lilly million due to its exercise of its option under our asset purchase and license agreement to reduce the agreed percentage of royalty payable by us to eli lilly for oritavancin product sales 
we expensed the million in as acquired research and development and milestone payments as oritavancin was in clinical development  had not reached technical feasibility and had no foreseeable alternative future use as of december  at december   the million was recorded as an accrued liability and was paid in january interest income interest income totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in was primarily due to declining investment yields on our cash and short term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates and a lower average portfolio balance for during the period 
interest and other expense interest expense totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense for each of and was primarily due to million in interest expense incurred on million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes which mature in july and million in interest expense related to the amortization of the deferred debt issuance cost 
as of december   we had million of unamortized deferred issuance costs related to these convertible subordinated notes 
provision for income taxes due to our continuing operating losses and the uncertainty of our recognizing the potential future benefits from these losses  we recorded no provision or benefit for income taxes for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources at december   we had available cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us federal and state governments and their agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure by imposing concentration limits and credit worthiness requirements for all corporate issuers 
in  we completed the repurchase of million of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due july and issued million of convertible senior notes due in march we paid a total of million related to the repurchase  which included million for accrued interest on the convertible subordinated notes and a premium of million recognized as a loss on the early extinguishment of debt 
we also expensed a non cash charge of approximately million for the acceleration of the amortization of the deferred issuance costs associated with the notes 
operating activities used million in cash during the year ended december   primarily due to the loss from operations of million and an increase in inventories of million 
the use of funds was offset by an increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and accrued compensation of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to the timing of payments of accounts payable at december   including our inventory purchases from bi austria 
details concerning the loss from operations can be found above in this report under the heading results of operations 
investing activities provided million in cash during the year ended december   due in part to maturities and sales of short term investments totaling million  offset by million of short term investment purchases and purchases of property and equipment of million 
cash provided by investing activities increased by million for the period  compared to the same period in  primarily due to a higher draw down of the available for sale investment portfolio of million  and million paid in the period related to the purchase of acquired product rights  including research and development and milestone payments 
cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to the receipt of net proceeds of million related to the issuance of million face value convertible senior notes due march these proceeds were offset by the repurchase of million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due july we paid a total of million related to the repurchase  which included million for accrued interest on the convertible subordinated notes and a premium of million recognized as a loss on the early extinguishment of debt 
we also expensed a non cash charge of approximately million for the acceleration of the amortization of the deferred issuance costs associated with the notes 
we do not have any special purpose entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements 
we have no commercial commitments with related parties  except for ongoing payments in connection with the oritavancin acquisition from eli lilly to the sgo group llc  in which nicholas simon  a former member of our board of directors who resigned in february  was a principal at the time of the acquisition 
we paid an execution fee of million to sgo group llc during and have accrued million that is potentially due to the sgo group 
we have no loans with related parties  except for executive loans to dr 
marianne armstrong  our senior vice president of regulatory medical affairs and drug safety in the amount of million  and dr 
lawrence blatt  our senior vice president of preclinical and applied research  in the amount of million 
both of these loans were in place prior to the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act in we believe that we will continue to require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our product candidates 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from our operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the end of however  this forward looking statement is based upon the risks identified in this report  our current plans and assumptions  which may change  and our capital requirements  which may increase in future periods 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the commercial performance of any of our products or product candidates in development that receive commercial approval  our ability to partner our development and commercialization programs  the progress of our research and development efforts  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  determinations as to the commercial potential of our product candidates in development  the pace of expansion of administrative expenses  the status of competitive products and competitive barriers to entry  the establishment and maintenance of manufacturing capacity through third party manufacturing agreements  the pace of expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities  in preparation for product launches  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other companies  the ability to divest oritavancin and amphotec  the payments of annual interest on our long term debt  and whether we must repay the principal in connection with our convertible debt obligations 
as a result  we may require additional funds and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
we have no commitments for such fund raising activities at this time 
additional funding may not be available to finance our operations when needed or  if available  the terms for obtaining such funds may not be favorable or may result in dilution to our stockholders 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities  such as milestone payments  for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type in millions contractual obligations total after long term debt obligations operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations inventory non cancelable purchase obligations other research and development funding commitments total contractual cash obligations these amounts include interest payments and principal amount of the convertible senior notes due these amounts consist of clinical and marketing related obligations 
the operating leases for our facilities require letters of credit secured by a restricted cash balance with our bank 
the amount of each letter of credit approximates months of operating rent payable to the landlord of each facility 
the majority of our non cancelable purchase obligations for inventory are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the purchase of actimmune inventory  which is denominated in euros 
we assumed an average foreign currency exchange rate of euro to us dollars of over the length of the agreement 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the consensus reached on the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the issue s objective is to provide guidance for identifying other than temporarily impaired investments 
eitf also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp eitf that delays the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance in eitf until further notice 
the disclosure requirements of eitf are effective with this annual report for fiscal once the fasb reaches a final decision on the measurement and recognition provisions  we will evaluate the impact of the adoption of the accounting provisions of eitf in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  effective beginning after june  fas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and will require companies to recognize compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to share based payments including stock options and stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
we will be required to implement fas r no later than the third quarter that begins july  we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of fas r  and therefore cannot estimate the impact of our adoption at this time 
these methodologies and assumptions may be different than those we currently employ in applying fas  outlined in stock based compensation above 
we expect that the adoption of fas r will have an impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
material weakness and remediation in connection with management s assessment of its internal control over financial reporting as of december   we have determined that we have a material weakness in our financial statement close process  related to the preparation and review of the annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnote disclosures in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and the rules and regulations of the sec 
the insufficient controls include a lack of finance staff with the proficiency to interpret such principles and rules  and inadequate review and approval procedures to prepare external financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and the rules and regulations of the sec 
as a result of this material weakness  management made material revisions to the annual consolidated financial statements  footnote disclosures before they were issued 
in  we began an evaluation of our finance department staffing and as a result have terminated certain employees and hired additional personnel with technical accounting expertise to improve our financial statement close process 
we intend to continue to improve our financial statement close process in including the remediation of the material weakness dicussed above by identifying  recruiting  and training personnel with the appropriate accounting and sec reporting skills 
please refer to item a of this annual report on form k for management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
our efforts to enhance our systems of internal control by adding additional qualified personnel and our continuing compliance with sarbanes oxley section and the related audit of that assessment by our registered public accounting firm has required  and will continue to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
our internal control systems are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and our board of directors that our internal control over financial reporting is adequate  but there can be no guarantee that such controls will be effective 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us federal and state governments and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates we maintain investments of shorter effective maturities 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  by effective maturity in millions  except percentages and beyond total fair value at december  assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes due average interest rate the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as december  by effective maturity in millions  except percentages total fair value at december  assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities convertible subordinated notes due average interest rate foreign currency market risk we have obligations denominated in euros for the purchase of actimmune inventory 
in  we used foreign currency forward contracts to partially mitigate this exposure 
we regularly evaluate the cost benefit of entering into such arrangements and presently have no foreign currency hedge agreements outstanding
