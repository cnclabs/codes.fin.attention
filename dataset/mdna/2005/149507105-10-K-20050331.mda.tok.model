item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands overview cavalier homes  inc and its subsidiaries produce  sell and finance manufactured housing 
the manufactured housing industry is cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by many of the same economic and demographic factors that affect the housing market as a whole 
as a result of the growth in the industry during much of the s  the number of retail dealerships  manufacturing capacity and wholesale shipments expanded significantly  which ultimately created slower retail turnover  higher retail inventory levels and increased price competition 
the industry also has been impacted by an increase in dealer failures  a severe reduction in available consumer credit and wholesale dealer financing for manufactured housing  more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels  each of which have contributed to a reduction in wholesale industry shipments to a year low 
industry company shipments and market share the manufactured housing institute mhi reported that wholesale floor shipments were down in  as compared to the cumulative decline from through of is detailed in the following table 
floor shipments nationwide cavalier s core states increase increase increase increase decrease decrease market decrease decrease market year industry from prior year cavalier from prior year share industry from prior year cavalier from prior year share during this industry downturn  the company s shipments fell in and disproportionately to the industry decline which the company believes was due to its strategy  early in the downturn  of working closely with its dealers to assist them in reducing retail inventories  which also lessened the company s risk severity associated with dealer failures 
the years and resulted in significant market share gains for the company due mainly to the company s aggressive marketing strategies  especially product offerings  which are core to its plan for returning to profitability 
in and  the company believes its reduction in market share was due to several factors 
external causes include an intensely competitive marketplace and a lack of chattel home only financing for all homes  especially single wide homes  in the industry  and internally  the company s momentum was negatively impacted by the consolidation of its sales force and the closing of home manufacturing facilities during for  industry sources project a increase in shipment levels with a seasonally slow first quarter and gradual improvement for the nd and rd quarters 
the company believes it is well positioned to strengthen its competitive position in the marketplace going forward with a value packed product line  including broader product offerings on price points as well as enhanced features and a line of modular homes 
industry finance environment a major factor contributing to the manufactured housing industry growth in the s was relaxed credit standards  which ultimately resulted in a change in the financing approach in the industry due to underperforming manufactured housing loans 
throughout the past six years  the industry has been impacted significantly by reduced financing available at both the wholesale and retail levels  with several lenders exiting the marketplace or limiting their participation in the industry  coupled with more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels and limit wholesale shipments of new homes 
while the current industry trend is toward more land home real estate financing rather than chattel or home only loans  additional chattel lending availability could result in renewed demand for single wide products 
while land home financing generally offers more favorable credit terms to the retail buyer of manufactured housing  the length of time involved in closing land home transactions is greater 
the much anticipated infusion of new and competitive lending capacity  which the company believes is essential to support demand at higher levels has not yet materialized 
until there is substantial entry of finance resources to the manufactured housing market  the company believes a meaningful expansion for the industry will be delayed 
raw materials costs and gross margin additionally  the company s gross margin has been negatively impacted by price increases in substantially all raw materials certain prices continue to increase and show no signs of stabilization and overall commodity pressures ie global demand and capacity constraints and rising oil prices 
the company is experiencing tightened supply from its traditional vendors of certain types of raw materials required for the production of its homes 
the company is working to obtain these and substitute products from other vendors  which are likely to result in higher than normal costs 
while the company seeks to offset rising costs through increasing its selling prices  sudden increases in costs  coupled with dealers retail sales commitments  can affect the timing and ability of the company to pass on its cost increases 
the company is uncertain at this time as to the impact the extent and duration of the increased prices will have on the company s future revenue and earnings 
capacity and overhead costs in response to the continued weakening of the manufactured housing industry market conditions  the company announced its decision to close six manufacturing facilities in the fourth quarter of  one in july  and one in february these facilities were located in conway  arkansas  graham  texas  cordele  georgia  belmont  mississippi  haleyville  alabama  shippenville  pennsylvania  and fort worth  texas and collectively employed approximately  people 
the company has shifted a substantial part of the production from these plants with the exception of the pennsylvania plant to one or more of the company s operating plants 
the remaining plants will also handle dealer sales and customer service for the company s homes 
on the retail side  the company closed one retail sales center in august in terms of operating costs  the company has made cost reductions in virtually all areas of operations  including its exclusive dealer and marketing programs and its administrative personnel and associated costs 
altogether  the company has had a net reduction in its production and administrative workforce of approximately since december  the company is continuing to evaluate its options regarding capacity  cost and overhead issues  the need for further plant  retail and other consolidations  reductions  idling and closings and methods designed to address the company s financial performance in light of developing market and business conditions 
the company can give no assurance as to which one or more of these options  if any  it may ultimately adopt  and  if adopted  whether and to what extent these actions will have an effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
debt and liquidity during  the company reduced long term debt by  from  to industrial real estate development term bonds loan totals balance  beginning of year    principal repayments scheduled   from proceeds of property sales   balance  end of year    the company improved its overall debt position by making scheduled principal repayments as well as making additional principal repayments from proceeds from sales of certain property 
while significantly reducing debt  the company s cash position at december  remained good 
as is customary for the company  most of its manufacturing operations are idle during the final two weeks of the year for vacations  holidays and reduced product demand  during which time the company collects the majority of its outstanding receivables  resulting in higher year end cash balances than at other quarter ends 
outlook the company s net income in was primarily due to its participation in building single section homes as part of the federal emergency management agency s fema disaster relief for victims of the hurricanes 
shipments under the fema contract were completed as of december  for  the company expects the market will likely remain sluggish for some time  owing in part to seasonality 
the recent industry downturn has reduced excess dealer inventory to the point that an increase in demand will likely translate more directly into new orders 
meanwhile  the market for repossessed homes appears to be firming in both price and quantity 
however  the much anticipated infusion of new and competitive lending capacity  which the company believes is essential to support demand at higher levels  has not yet materialized 
until there is substantial entry of finance resources to the manufactured housing market  the company believes a meaningful expansion for the industry will be delayed 
the company expects to report a loss for the first quarter of due primarily to the seasonality of the period  high raw materials prices as discussed above  and employee termination costs that will be incurred mostly in the first quarter in connection with the closing of the texas facility of approximately longer term  however  the company believes the steps taken to reduce its costs and lower its breakeven point will position it to return to profitable operations later in and strengthen its competitive position in the marketplace going forward 
however  the company is uncertain at this time as to the impact the extent and duration of the general economic conditions and adverse industry conditions will have on the company s future revenue and earnings 
while the company currently expects the results of operations for the first quarter of to be a loss  changes in general economic conditions that affect consumer purchases  availability of adequate financing sources  increases in repossessions or dealer failures could affect the results of operations of the company

on october   the company amended its credit facility the credit facility with its primary lender  to extend the maturity date under the revolving line of credit available under the credit facility to april a director of the company served as the president of the primary lender until august  the credit facility is comprised of a revolving line of credit which provides for borrowings including letters of credit up to  and a real estate term loan year component of  which are cross secured and cross defaulted 
the amount available under the revolving line of credit  up to  is equal to the lesser of an amount based on defined percentages of accounts and notes receivable and inventories or certain levels of tangible net worth plus all treasury stock purchases after december   as noted in the following table 
tangible net worth credit facility tnw available above  of tnw    to zero dollar for dollar reduction at december    was available under the revolving line of credit  after deducting letters of credit of  the company did not have any amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit as of december  or the applicable interest rates under the revolving line of credit are based on certain levels of tangible net worth as noted in the following table 
tangible net worth tnw interest rate above  prime less   prime   prime plus   prime plus below  prime plus the real estate term loan agreement contained in the credit facility provides for borrowings of  of which  was outstanding at december  and  was outstanding at december  interest on the term note is fixed for a period of five years from issuance at and may be adjusted at and years 
amounts outstanding under the real estate term loan are collateralized by certain plant facilities and equipment 
the credit facility  as amended  contains certain restrictive and financial covenants which  among other things  limit the company s ability  without the lender s consent  to i make dividend payments and purchases of treasury stock in an aggregate amount which exceeds of consolidated net income for the two most recent years  ii mortgage or pledge assets which exceed  in the aggregate   iii incur additional indebtedness  including lease obligations  which exceed in the aggregate  excluding floor plan notes payable which cannot exceed  and iv make annual capital expenditures in excess of  in addition  the credit facility contains certain financial covenants requiring the company to maintain on a consolidated basis certain defined levels of debt to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed to and cash flow to debt service ratio of not less than to commencing with the year ending december  and to for the years ending december  and thereafter  and to maintain a current ratio  as defined  of at least to and consolidated tangible net worth of at least  the credit facility also requires cis to comply with certain specified restrictions and financial covenants 
at december   the company was in compliance with its debt covenants 
since its inception  cis has been restricted in the amount of loans it could purchase based on underwriting standards  as well as the availability of working capital and funds borrowed under the company s credit line with its primary lender 
from time to time  the company evaluates the potential to sell all or a portion of its remaining installment loan portfolio  in addition to the periodic sale of installment contracts purchased by cis in the future 
cis is currently re selling loans to other lenders under various retail finance contracts 
the company believes the periodic sale of installment contracts under these retail finance agreements will reduce requirements for both working capital and borrowings  increase the company s liquidity  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and enhance the ability of cis to increase its volume of loan purchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional sales will be made under these agreements  or that cis and the company will be able to realize the expected benefits from such agreements 
the company currently believes existing cash and funds available under the credit facility  together with cash provided by operations  will be adequate to fund the company s operations and plans for the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances to this effect 
if it is not  or if the company is unable to remain in compliance with its covenants under its credit facility  the company would seek to maintain or enhance its liquidity position and capital resources through modifications to or waivers under the credit facility  incurrence of additional short or long term indebtedness or other forms of financing  asset sales  restructuring of debt  and or the sale of equity or debt securities in public or private transactions  the availability and terms of which will depend on various factors and market and other conditions  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
projected cash to be provided by operations in the coming year is largely dependent on sales volume 
the company s manufactured homes are sold mainly through independent dealers who generally rely on third party lenders to provide floor plan financing for homes purchased 
in addition  third party lenders generally provide consumer financing for manufactured home purchases 
the company s sales depend in large part on the availability and cost of financing for manufactured home purchasers and dealers as well as our own retail locations 
the availability and cost of such financing is further dependent on the number of financial institutions participating in the industry  the departure of financial institutions from the industry  the financial institutions lending practices  the strength of the credit markets generally  governmental policies and other conditions  all of which are beyond our control 
throughout the past five years the industry has been impacted significantly by reduced financing available at both the wholesale and retail levels  with several lenders exiting the marketplace or limiting their participation in the industry  coupled with more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels and limit wholesale shipments of new homes 
unfavorable changes in these factors and terms of financing in the industry may have a material adverse effect on cavalier s results of operations or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s material off balance sheet arrangements consist of repurchase obligations  guarantees and letters of credit 
each of these arrangements is discussed below under contractual obligations and commitments

the company has provided letters of credit to providers of certain of its surety bonds and insurance policies 
while the current letters of credit have a finite life  they are subject to renewal at different amounts based on the requirements of the insurance carriers 
the outstanding letters of credit reduce amounts available under the company s credit facility 
the company has recorded insurance expense based on anticipated losses related to these policies 
critical accounting estimates cavalier follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and use historical experience factors  current economic conditions and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a list of the accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations that require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
product warranties cavalier provides the initial retail homebuyer a one year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure  plumbing and electrical systems 
we record a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold  based upon our assessment of historical experience factors and current industry trends 
factors we use in the estimation of the warranty liability include historical sales amounts and warranty costs related to homes sold and any outstanding service work orders 
we have a reserve for estimated warranties of  and  
although we maintain reserves for such claims  based on our assessments as described above  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims or per claim costs exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on cavalier s results of operations 
insurance cavalier s workers compensation prior to february   and after april   product liability and general liability insurance coverages were provided under incurred loss  retrospectively rated premium plans 
under these plans  we incur insurance expense based upon various rates applied to current payroll costs and sales 
annually  such insurance expense is adjusted by the carrier for loss experience factors subject to minimum and maximum premium calculations 
refunds or additional premiums are estimated and recorded when sufficiently reliable data is available 
we were contingently liable at december  for future retrospective premium adjustments up to a maximum of approximately  in the event that additional losses are reported related to prior years 
we recorded an estimated liability of approximately  and  related to these contingent claims 
claims exceeding our current expense levels could have a material adverse effect on cavalier s results of operations 
reserve for repurchase commitments manufactured housing companies customarily enter into repurchase and other recourse agreements with lending institutions  which have provided wholesale floor plan financing to dealers 
a majority of cavalier s sales are made to dealers located primarily in the south central and south atlantic regions of the united states pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions 
these agreements generally provide that we will repurchase our new products from the lending institutions in the event such product is repossessed upon a dealer s default 
the risk of loss under repurchase agreements is lessened by sales of our manufactured homes are spread over a relatively large number of independent dealers  the largest of which accounted for approximately of sales in  the price that cavalier is obligated to pay under such repurchase agreements declines based on predetermined amounts over the period of the agreement generally to months and cavalier historically has been able to resell homes repurchased from lenders 
cavalier reviews the aging of retail dealers inventory to estimate the amount of inventory subject to repurchase obligation which is used to calculate the fair value of the floor plan guarantees 
additionally  we review repurchase notifications received from floor plan sources and review our dealer inventory for expected repurchase notifications based on various communications from the lenders and the dealers as well as for dealers who  we believe  are experiencing financial difficulty 
we apply a historical loss factor to the inventory estimated to be repurchased 
the maximum amount for which we are contingently liable under such agreements approximated  at december  changes in the level of retail inventories in the manufactured housing industry  either up or down  can have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
the deterioration in the availability of retail financing  along with significant competition from repossessed homes  has already extended the inventory adjustment period beyond what was originally expected 
if these trends were to continue  or if retail demand were to significantly weaken further  the inventory overhang could result in even greater intense price competition  cause further pressure on profit margins within the industry  and have a material adverse effect on cavalier 
the company s inventory at all retail locations  including company owned retail sales centers  declined in from and remained consistent from to cavalier believes that inventories of its homes are approaching levels which are more consistent with retail demand  due in part to the company s emphasis on working with its dealers to reduce retail inventories  although we cannot provide investors assurances to this effect 
in spite of these efforts  significant unfavorable developments or further deterioration within the industry would undoubtedly have an adverse impact on company operating results 
we have a reserve for repurchase commitments of  and  
the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
 are applicable to the company s repurchase commitments 
however  based on the company s evaluation  the impact of adopting fin was not material to the consolidated financial statements 
the company intends to adopt the provisions of fin to new guarantees issued on or after january  impairment of long lived assets since the latter part of  cavalier and the manufactured housing industry have experienced a downturn in business as discussed above 
due to deteriorating market conditions  during this time  we have idled  closed or sold manufactured housing facilities  a portion of our insurance and premium finance business  a portion of our supply operations and under performing retail locations 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  including goodwill and other intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of long lived assets is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such assets is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived assets 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved

goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for years beginning after december  sfas no 
specifies that goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead will be subject to periodic impairment testing 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  under the provisions of this statement  the company recorded a charge of  net of tax  or per diluted share  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  to eliminate all of its goodwill due to impairment 
the entire amount of the goodwill was associated with the company s home manufacturing unit 
the company and the manufactured housing industry have been impacted by inventory oversupply at the retail level  an increase in dealer failures  a reduction in available consumer credit and wholesale dealer financing for manufactured housing  more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels 
all of these factors caused the company to suffer significant losses from the last half of through the date of the initial valuation of goodwill under sfas no 
the fair value of the home manufacturing unit was determined by a third party valuation specialist  using projections provided by company management as well as industry and other market data 
the fair value of the home manufacturing unit was lower than the carrying value  which required allocation of the fair value to the assets and liabilities of the unit 
in this allocation process  various independent parties were used to appraise certain of the company s manufacturing fixed assets 
additionally  company management estimated fair value of other assets and liabilities based on assumptions believed to be appropriate to the valuation process 
as a result of this fair value allocation process  the company s goodwill was considered impaired and an adjustment was made during the first quarter of deferred tax asset the company has a full valuation allowance against net deferred income tax assets of  and  in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
realization of the deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances is largely dependent upon future profitable operations and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences

it is not appropriate to record income tax benefits in excess of anticipated refunds of taxes previously paid 
the valuation allowance may be reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred income tax assets are realized as a reduction of taxes otherwise payable on any future earnings or the valuation allowances are otherwise no longer required
