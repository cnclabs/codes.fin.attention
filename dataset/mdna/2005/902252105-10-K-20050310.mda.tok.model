overview we provide integrated information management solutions and services for local governments 
we develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the information technology it needs of cities  counties  schools and other local government entities 
in addition  we provide professional it services to our customers  including software and hardware installation  data conversion  training and for certain customers  product modifications  along with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems 
we also provide property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions 
our products are generally grouped into four major areas financial and city solutions  courts and justice  property appraisal and tax  and document management 
we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance 
these indicators include the following revenues we derive our revenues from four primary sources sale of software licenses  software services  appraisal services  and maintenance and support 
because we sell primarily off the shelf software  increased sales of software products generally result in incrementally higher gross margins 
thus  the most significant driver to our business is the number and size of software license sales 
in addition  new software license sales generally generate implementation services revenues as well as future maintenance and support revenues  which we view as a recurring revenue source 
we also monitor our customer base and churn since our maintenance and support revenue should increase due to our historically low customer turnover 
cost of revenues and gross margins our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation and appraisal services to our customers 
we can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base  especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost  such as software licenses and maintenance and support 
our appraisal projects are seasonal in nature  and we often employ appraisal personnel on a short term basis to coincide with the life of a project 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the primary components of sg a expense are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions  marketing expense  research and development costs  rent and professional fees 
sales commissions generally fluctuate with revenues but other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues  however  these costs have recently grown disproportionately because of the requirements of corporate governance legislation 
research and development costs will fluctuate from year to year depending on product development activity 

table of contents liquidity and cash flows the primary driver of our cash flows is net income 
in addition  cash flow was positively impacted when we sold our investment in hte  inc and received million in cash proceeds 
uses of cash include capital investments in software development and property and equipment and the discretionary purchases of treasury stock 
in  we purchased million shares of our common stock at our aggregate cash purchase price of million 
our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from customers in advance of revenue being earned 
balance sheet cash  accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business 
ebitda although ebitda is not a measure of liquidity required by or presented in accordance with gaap  we monitor ebitda as a liquidity measure because of our active acquisition program and the related amortization of our acquisition intangible assets and our significant investment in capitalized software development 
in addition we also use ebitda to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates 
however ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider ebitda as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
for example  ebitda does not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures  or changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs 
when considering acquisition opportunities  we generally focus on companies with strong management teams and employee groups and excellent customer relationships 
in december we acquired eden systems  inc eden  a provider of financial  personnel and citizen services systems for local governments 
in december  we also acquired certain assets of a business that provides forms software to users of some of our software products 
prior to these acquisitions  our most recent acquisition was completed in november critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to intangible assets  bad debts and our service contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived from sale of software licenses  appraisal services  maintenance and support  and services that typically range from installation  training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs 
for multiple element software arrangements  which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and non refundable claim 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  sales adjustments and estimated cost of product warranties  which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized 
because most of our customers are governmental entities  we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments 
occasionally  customers may become dissatisfied with the functionality of the software products and or the quality of the services and request a reduction of the total contract price or similar concession 
while we engage in extensive product and service quality assurance programs and processes  our allowances for these contract price reductions may need to be revised in the future 
in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion  our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis 
also  management at our corporate offices as well as at our operating companies review  on at least a quarterly basis  significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts  sales adjustments and estimated cost of product warranties may require revision  include  but are not limited to  deterioration of a customer s financial condition  failure to manage our customer s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered  and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 
for those software arrangements that include customization of the software  which is considered essential to its functionality  and for substantially all of our real estate appraisal outsourcing projects  we recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses using the 
table of contents percentage of completion method and the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition 
these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue  billings and collections and expected contract costs  as well as measures of progress toward completion 
we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
at times  we perform additional and or non contractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known 
we use contract accounting  primarily the percentage of completion method  for those software arrangements that include customization or modification of the software  or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software 
in addition  we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition for our real estate appraisal projects  some of which can range up to three years 
in connection with these and certain other contracts  we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable and or payable pursuant to the contract 
the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 
in connection with certain of our contracts  we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date 
many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period 
management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue 
in addition  we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned 
this liability primarily consists of maintenance billings in which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period  generally one year 
we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met 
on a periodic basis  we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 
intangible assets and goodwill 
our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances  and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense  as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value  with the excess allocated to goodwill 
accordingly  we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets  including software  customer related intangibles  trade name and goodwill 
in addition  we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
certain of these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value  generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used  or a significant adverse change in the business climate 
in addition  products  capabilities  or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or non competitive 

table of contents analysis of results of operations and other the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december   and these results include the results of operations of eden from the date of its acquisition on december  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

in thousands total total software licenses software services maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total revenues software licenses 
for the year ended december   software license revenues included million related to eden systems  compared to  for the same prior year period 
excluding the software license revenue related to eden  the increase in software license revenues from to was approximately  or 
the change was the result of the following factors financial and city solutions software license revenues excluding eden increased million due to a combination of geographic expansion on the west coast and in the southwest united states  and an increase in our implementation staff  which has allowed us to install software products more quickly 
in addition  the completion in march of software enhancements to one of our financial software products has enabled us to expand into larger cities and counties  resulting in larger contracts 
our financial and city solutions software products automate accounting systems for cities  counties  school districts  public utilities and not for profit organizations 
justice and courts software license revenues decreased million compared to the prior year with approximately million of the decline due to lower revenues from odyssey case management system odyssey courts 
in september  we successfully installed the first phase of odyssey courts in the state of minnesota and lee county  florida 
the contract with the state of minnesota is one of the largest software contracts in our history  and we recorded million of software license revenue in for both minnesota and lee county 
in  we had seven odyssey contracts in process  several of which began late in the year 
we are recognizing revenue on these contracts using contract accounting and recorded approximately million of revenue for odyssey contracts in the remaining decline reflects lower sales of our legacy courts and justice products 
we have recently introduced a variety of new software products which have replaced certain legacy products 
the acceptance of these new products in the marketplace is on going 
the following software products have been released in the last two years products general release date odyssey courts september orion appraisal and tax and other related products march december eagle document management july 
table of contents software services 
software services revenues increased million  or  compared to the prior year period after excluding the increase in software services revenues generated by eden of million 
higher software services revenues were attributable to the following factors excluding eden  software services revenues from our financial and city solutions products were million  or  higher in  primarily as a result of the increase in related software licenses sales over the prior year 
typically  contracts for software license include services such as installing the software  converting the customers data to be compatible with the software and training customer personnel to use the software 
increased staffing levels also allowed for faster implementation of our backlog 
in addition  we have been expanding our application service provider asp and disaster recovery markets  which contributed approximately  to the increase in software services revenues related to appraisal software products for the year ended december  were million higher than the prior year 
sales of orion  our new appraisal and tax product generated approximately million of the increase 
in  our document management division entered into a million contract to convert data into a microfilm format  which generated a  increase in software services revenue over the prior year 
this contract is expected to be completed in late maintenance 
we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software 
maintenance revenues for the year ended december  included million from eden  compared to  for the same prior year period 
excluding the impact of eden  maintenance revenues during the year ended december  increased approximately compared to due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on certain product lines 
appraisal services 
the decrease in appraisal services revenues is due to the completion of certain significant appraisal contracts  particularly the completion of our contract with lake county  indiana in the fourth quarter of these larger projects are often relatively discretionary in nature  and the projects we recently completed have not been replaced by similar projects 
cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and associated gross margins  and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december of of related related vs 
in thousands revenues revenues software licenses software services and maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total cost of revenues overall gross margin cost of software license revenues 
the increase is related to the general release of several software development products and the commencement of the related amortization expense 
once a product is released  we begin to amortize the costs associated with its development over the estimated useful life of the product 
amortization expense is determined on a product by product basis at an annual rate not less than straight line basis over the product s estimated life generally years 
development costs consist mainly of personnel costs  such as salary and benefits paid to our developers  and rent for related office space 
current year product releases include the orion appraisal and tax products and an enhancement to one of our financial and city solutions products 
amortization expense for also includes a full year of expense related to odyssey courts versus only four months in 
table of contents cost of software services and maintenance revenues 
cost of software services and maintenance revenues primarily consists of expenses  such as personnel costs related to installation of our software licenses  conversion of customer data  training customer personnel  support activities and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery 
during the year ended december   eden contributed cost of software services and maintenance revenues of million  compared to  in the prior year 
excluding eden  cost of software services and maintenance revenues increased million  or  during additional staff has been added to provide faster implementation of our existing backlog 
excluding eden  software services and maintenance revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to cost of software services and maintenance revenues increased more than the associated revenues due to the time required to train and orient additional personnel hired during before they can effectively perform revenue generating tasks  such as training and implementations 
in addition  expenses increased as the costs related to certain employees who previously worked on new software development products ceased to be capitalized as those projects were completed and these employees moved into implementation and support functions 
cost of appraisal services revenues 
the decline in the cost of appraisal services revenues is consistent with lower appraisal services revenues 
in  appraisal revenues declined at a faster rate than cost of appraisal revenues due to the use of subcontractors to supplement our appraisal staff on some of our larger contracts during  resulting in lower margins 
the nature and timing of these contracts required us to retain staff on either short notice or with specific qualifications  thus increasing the associated costs as a percentage of appraisal revenues 
gross margin 
excluding the results of eden  our gross margin for was compared to in the prior year 
the decline in gross margin from the prior year period was due to the following factors higher amortization costs of our software development products released from mid year through  and the utilization of sub contractors by our property appraisal and tax and document management divisions during selling  general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the following years ended december of of vs 
in thousands revenues revenues selling  general and administrative expenses sg a associated with eden amounted to million in compared to  in excluding eden  sg a increased year over year 
the increase in sg a is a result of the following factors costs to comply with corporate governance and public disclosure requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and new york stock exchange rules  including those associated with documenting and testing internal controls 
compliance costs have been very high and have significantly exceeded our original estimates 
these costs consist of the engagement of a third party firm to consult with us on the development and testing of our controls  as well as the incremental costs associated with the independent auditors attesting to the effectiveness of these controls 
while some of the expenses we are incurring this year may be considered one time costs  it is clear that the new regulatory environment places an expensive burden on companies that will continue into the future  increased headcount in our sales and marketing areas to support geographic expansion  higher commissions related to higher revenue levels  and higher research and development costs 

table of contents amortization of acquisition intangibles the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of acquisition intangibles for the following years ended december vs 
in thousands amortization of acquisition intangibles amortization expense has declined compared to the prior year due to certain intangible assets recorded for previous acquisitions that became fully amortized beginning mid and throughout this decline was offset somewhat by the amortization expense for acquisition intangibles recorded for the acquisition of eden in december acquisition intangibles are composed of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired and amortizable software  customer related intangibles and trade name with the remainder allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization 
the estimated useful lives of acquired software  customer related intangibles and trade name are to years  to years and to years  respectively 
estimated annual amortization expense relating to acquisition intangibles for the next five years is as follows in thousands realized gain on sale of investment in hte  inc on march   we received cash proceeds of million in connection with a transaction to sell all of our million shares of hte  inc hte common stock to sungard data systems inc for cash per share 
our original cost basis in the hte shares was million 
after transaction and other costs  we recorded a gross realized gain of million million or per diluted share after income taxes of million for the year ended december  income tax provision the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december vs 
in thousands income tax provision effective income tax rate the effective income tax rates for the periods presented were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of primarily due to the utilization of the capital loss carryforward in  increased state income taxes and non deductible meals and entertainment costs 
the income tax provision for the year ended december  includes income tax expense of million relating to the realized gain from the sale of our investment in hte after reduction in valuation allowance related to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward amounting to million on a tax effected basis 
for  we had an effective income tax rate of excluding the effect of the hte gain compared to in the majority of the increase was due to higher state income taxes because in we had more sales and profitability in highly taxed states than in the prior year 
discontinued operations one of our non operating subsidiaries  swan transportation company swan  had been involved in various claims raised by former employees of a foundry that was owned by an affiliate of swan and tyler prior to december these claims were for alleged work related injuries and physical conditions resulting from alleged exposure to silica  asbestos  and or related industrial dusts 
after a series of bankruptcy court filings involving swan  on december   tyler in accordance with the terms of the plan of reorganization  transferred the stock of swan to the swan asbestos and silica trust trust  an unaffiliated entity that will oversee 
table of contents the processing and payment of all present and future claims related to the foundry 
on december   we paid million to the trust in full and final release from all liability for claims associated with the once owned foundry the swan matter 
as a result of the release  any claimant is barred from asserting any such claim  either now or in the future  against tyler or its affected affiliates 
during the year ended december   the gain on disposal of discontinued operations of  primarily resulted because we fully settled the swan matter at an amount less than initially recorded and certain aspects of the settlement were conducted in a beneficial tax manner 
accordingly  we recognized for the first time certain tax benefits associated with payments on behalf of the swan matter

software license revenues for benefited from the successful first phase installation of odyssey courts in the state of minnesota and lee county  florida 
software license revenues from these two contracts totaled million for the year ended december  compared to none in the prior year 
in addition  we increased revenues from our financial and city solutions software products by approximately  primarily by increasing sales and implementation staff and releasing a new version of one of our county tax products for our customers in the midwest 
however  sales of third party software licenses relating to our financial and city solutions products declined by approximately  due to the sales of a one time upgrade of the graphical user interface on some of our proprietary products in and decreased emphasis on sales of third party licenses in in late  we opened a new financial and city solutions sales office in california in an effort to further penetrate the west coast market 
we also experienced a decline in our property appraisal and tax software license revenues of approximately  most of this decline related to one large property appraisal and tax software installation in the third quarter of 
table of contents software services 
higher software services revenues were attributable to the following factors services related to implementation of odyssey courts 
our new courts and justice product accounted for approximately of the software services increase 
in  we recognized million of services revenue compared to million in the prior year for minnesota and lee county contracts 
software services related to the increase in software license contracts signed in late and in the first half of increased training staff has also allowed for faster implementation of our backlog 
services related to property appraisal and tax software and financial and city solutions software each contributed approximately million and million  respectively  of the increase in over maintenance 
the maintenance revenue increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher rates on certain product lines 
appraisal services 
the decrease is related to the completion and progression of several major appraisal contracts 
during  we signed a new six year contract to provide nassau county  new york board of assessors nassau county extension with updated property assessments and additional property appraisal and tax software

the amortization for odyssey courts is calculated using the straight line method of amortization over an estimated five year useful life 
in  we recorded amortization expense of approximately  related to odyssey courts for the period september  general release date through december  in addition  during  we had several smaller products in the development stage released in late and early that contributed to the increase in amortization expense 

table of contents cost of software services and maintenance revenues 
the increase in costs is consistent with higher software services and maintenance revenues for the same periods  although software services and maintenance revenues grew at a more rapid rate than the cost of those revenues  which is reflective of more efficient utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale 
cost of appraisal services revenues 
the decrease in the cost of appraisal services revenues is consistent with the decrease in appraisal services revenues 
we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects completion 
however  key appraisal personnel and management were retained in anticipation of new appraisal contracts  which contributed to a decline in appraisal gross margins compared to gross margin 
our overall gross margin improved over the prior year due to higher software services and maintenance revenues without a corresponding increase in related personnel costs reflecting a more efficient utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale 
improvements in software services and maintenance gross margin were slightly offset by declines in software license gross margin due to amortization of new product releases and declines in the appraisal services gross margin

during we issued  shares of common stock and received million in aggregate proceeds  upon exercise of stock options and during we issued  shares of common stock and received million in aggregate proceeds upon exercise of stock options 
during  we received  for contributions to the tyler technologies  inc employee stock purchase plan the espp  which was adopted by our shareholders in may in october  we issued  shares of common stock for contributions made to the espp during the three months ended september  in january  we issued  shares of common stock for contributions made to the espp during the three months ended december  in march we retired an outstanding million  promissory note payable 
the note was originally due in january and required quarterly interest payments 
subsequent to december  and through march  we have purchased approximately  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of million 
excluding acquisitions  we anticipate that capital spending will be approximately million  million of which will be related to software development 
capital spending in is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 
from time to time we will engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates 
in order to pursue such opportunities  which could require significant commitments of capital  we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future 
no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 
in the absence of future acquisitions of other businesses  we believe our current cash balances and expected future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and other activities through the next twelve months 
if operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our needs  we may borrow under our credit agreement 

table of contents we primarily lease offices  as well as transportation  computer and other equipment used in our operations under non cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options 
following are the future obligations under non cancelable leases at december  in thousands thereafter total future rental payments under operating leases it is not our usual business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
moreover  it is not our normal policy to issue guarantees to third parties 
as of december   we have no material purchase commitments  except for the operating lease commitments listed above 
capitalization at december   our capitalization consisted of million of shareholders equity 
factors that may affect future results and market price of our stock an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report 
any of the following factors could materially harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report 
we may make forward looking statements from time to time  both written and oral 
we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 
a decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 
a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend  in part  on our customers level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services 
moreover  demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 
we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and our operating results 
our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations  which could lead to a decline in our stock price 
our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons  including the following a significant number of our prospective customers decisions regarding whether to enter into license agreements with us are made within the last few weeks of each quarter  we have historically had a higher concentration of revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending tendencies  the size of license transactions can vary significantly  customers may unexpectedly postpone or cancel orders due to changes in their strategic priorities  project objectives  budget or personnel  customer purchasing processes vary significantly and a customer s internal approval and expenditure authorization process can be difficult and time consuming to complete  even after selection of a vendor  the number  timing  and significance of software product enhancements and new software product announcements by us and our competitors may affect purchase decisions  and we may have to defer revenues under our revenue recognition policies 

table of contents fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results 
in each fiscal quarter our expense levels  operating costs  and hiring plans are based on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed 
if our actual revenues fall below expectations  we could experience a reduction in operating results 
as with other software vendors  we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods  which could adversely impact our operating results 
we have in the past had to  and in the future may have to  defer revenue recognition for license fees due to several factors  including whether license agreements include applications that are under development or other undelivered elements  we must deliver services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  including significant modifications  customization  or complex interfaces  which could delay product delivery or acceptance  the transaction involves acceptance criteria  the transaction involves contingent payment terms or fees  we are required to accept a fixed fee services contract  or we are required to accept extended payment terms 
because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for software revenue recognition  we must have very precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or perform services 
negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle  and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations  and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
the costs required to comply with such evolving laws are difficult to predict 
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards 
this investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities  which may harm our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results 
we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue 
the majority of our contracts include both software licenses and the provision of professional services 
therefore  an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 
selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state  county and city governments  other municipal agencies  and other public entities 
we expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future 
we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities  including the sales cycle of governmental agencies may be complex and lengthy  payments under some public sector contracts are subject to achieving implementation milestones  and we have had  and may in the future have  differences with customers as to whether milestones have been achieved  political resistance to the concept of government agencies contracting with third parties to provide information technology solutions  changes in legislation authorizing government s contracting with third parties  the internal review process by governmental agencies for bid acceptance  changes to the bidding procedures by governmental agencies  
table of contents changes in governmental administrations and personnel  limitations on governmental resources placed by budgetary restraints  which in some circumstances  may provide for a termination of executed contracts because of a lack of future funding  and the general effect of economic downturns and other changes on local governments ability to spend public funds on outsourcing arrangements 
each of these risks is outside our control 
if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties  our financial performance could be adversely affected 
the open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 
many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process 
generally  a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements 
to respond successfully to these requests for proposals  we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract  the time required to establish operations for the proposed client  and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted 
we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process  or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms 
our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process  or to secure such contracts on favorable terms  may adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
fixed price contracts may affect our profits 
some of our present contracts are on a fixed priced basis  which can lead to various risks  including the failure to accurately estimate the resources and time required for an engagement  the failure to effectively manage governmental agencies and other customers expectations regarding the scope of services to be delivered for an estimated price  and the failure to timely complete fixed price engagements within budget to the customers satisfaction 
if we do not adequately assess these and other risks  we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties  which may harm our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 
we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector 
however  we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us  as well as from companies offering to develop custom software 
we compete on the basis of a number of factors  including the attractiveness of the business strategy and services we offer  the breadth of products and services we offer  price  quality of products and service  technological innovation  name recognition  and our ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the particular needs of our customers 
we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size  primary computer platforms  and overall product scope 
our competitors include the consulting divisions of national and regional accounting firms  publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market  and a significant number of smaller  privately held companies 
certain competitors have greater technical  marketing  and financial resources than us 
we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 
we also compete with internal  centralized information service departments of governmental entities  which requires us to persuade the end user to stop the internal service and outsource to us 
in addition  our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments  which will reduce the market for our services 

table of contents we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
further  competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our software licenses and related services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and the failure to do so would have material adverse effect upon our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements  and achieve market acceptance 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner 
further  we cannot assure you that the products  capabilities  or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and cost effective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products  or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance  our business  operating results  and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 
we have expanded our operations rapidly since february  when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector 
we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this rapid growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems  procedures  and controls on a timely basis 
we must also identify  hire  train  and manage key managerial and technical personnel 
if we fail to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new product and geographic markets 
although our future focus will be on internal growth  we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions and other strategic alliances into our operations 
acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including diversion of management s attention  failure to retain key acquired personnel  unanticipated events or circumstances  legal liabilities  and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets 
some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates  we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates 
there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 
we may be unable to hire  integrate  and retain qualified personnel 
our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management  sales  marketing  customer support  and product development personnel 
the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us 
we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract  integrate  and retain such personnel 
we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
competition for qualified software development  sales  and other personnel is intense  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

table of contents we may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 
we occasionally expand our business through the acquisition of complementary companies 
we cannot  however  make any assurances that we will be able to identify any potential acquisition candidates or complete any additional acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated or will be advantageous to us 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 
many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information  trade secrets  know how  and other intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of contracts  copyrights  and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology 
we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  there has been significant litigation in the united states in recent years involving intellectual property rights 
we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation 
we may  however  be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information  trade secrets  know how  and other intellectual property rights 
further  we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products 
any claims or litigation  with or without merit  could be time consuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management s attention 
further  any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
such royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
thus  litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations  regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 
our products are complex and  as such  we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or enhancements 
software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
although we have not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date  we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product shipments 
any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims 
it is possible  however  that we may not always be able to negotiate such provisions in our contracts with customers or that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal  state or local laws  ordinances  or judicial decisions 
although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance  and we try to structure our contracts to include limitations on liability  we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our application service provider strategy has yet to gain widespread acceptance 
some businesses choose to access enterprise software applications through application service providers  or asps  which are businesses that host applications and provide access to software on a subscription basis 
the public sector market for asp solutions is new and unproven 
acceptance of our asp model depends upon the ability and willingness of different governmental entities to accept and implement asp solutions 
some prospective clients have expressed security and privacy concerns with the asp model  including a concern regarding the confidential nature of the information and transactions available from and conducted with governments and concerns regarding off site storage of such information 
we have limited experience selling our solutions through asps and may not be successful in generating revenue from this distribution channel 

table of contents changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to increased expenses 
some of our customers  primarily those for our property appraisal services  require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor 
the number of qualified  high rated insurance companies that offer performance bonds has decreased in recent years  while the costs associated with securing these bonds has increased dramatically 
in addition  we are generally required to issue a letter of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond 
each letter of credit we issue without corresponding cash collateral reduces our borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit agreement 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards  particularly large property appraisal services contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
recent volatility in the stock markets  increasing shareholder litigation  the adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls in particular  legislation adopted to prevent future corporate and accounting scandals  as well as other factors have recently led to significant increases in premiums for directors and officers liability insurance 
the number of insurers offering directors and officers insurance at competitive rates has also decreased in recent years 
we cannot predict when the insurance market for such coverage will stabilize  if at all 
the continued volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and administrative expenses  which may adversely affect future operating results 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many different factors 
some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price include actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products  or new contracts by us or our competitors  developments with respect to patents  copyrights  or other proprietary rights  conditions and trends in the software and other technology industries  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results  and financial condition 
historically  we have not paid dividends on our common stock 
we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in february our credit agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends 
we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 
our board of directors may issue up to  shares of preferred stock and may determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges  and restrictions  including voting and conversion rights  of these shares of preferred stock 
these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  some provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  and of the delaware general corporation law could also delay  prevent  or make more difficult a merger  tender offer  or proxy contest involving us 

table of contents financial outlook from time to time in press releases and otherwise  we may publish forecasts or other forward looking statements regarding our results  including estimated revenues or net earnings 
any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties  and as a matter of course  any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
further  the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse 
current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forward looking information  as well as other available information regarding us  our products and services  and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates 
as of december   we had funds invested in a state and municipal bond mutual fund and auction rate municipal and corporate bonds  all of which we accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these investments were treated as available for sale under sfas no 
the carrying value of these investments approximates fair market value 
we are not exposed to any market risk related to the municipal bond mutual fund as we liquidated it in february due to the nature of the auction rate municipal and corporate bonds  we are not subject to significant market rate risk 
we have no outstanding debt at december   and we therefore are not subject to any interest rate risk
