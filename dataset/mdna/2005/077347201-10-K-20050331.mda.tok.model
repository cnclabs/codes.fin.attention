item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto 
the discussion of results  causes and trends should not be construed to infer any conclusion that such results  causes or trends will necessarily continue in the future 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  investments  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company determines its reserves by both specific identification of customer accounts where appropriate and the application of historical loss experience to non specific accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company makes purchasing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers  the availability and pricing of raw materials and projected customer requirements 
future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to the company s operations include miscalculating customer requirements  technology changes which render certain raw materials and finished goods obsolete  loss of customers and or cancellation of sales orders  stock rotation with distributors and termination of distribution agreements 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon the aforementioned assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
when inventory is written off  it is never written back up  the cost remains at zero or the level to which it has been written down 
when inventory that has been written off is subsequently used in the manufacturing process  the lower adjusted cost of the material is charged to cost of sales 
during the company wrote down or reserved million of inventory  including non cancelable purchase commitments 
at december   approximately million of inventory at original cost before the write down or reserve in was on hand 
during and approximately million and million of this inventory was scrapped 
management intends to retain the balance of this inventory for possible use in future orders 
should any of this inventory be used in the manufacturing process for customer orders  the improved gross profit will be recognized at the time the completed product is shipped and the sale is recorded 
the following is a quarterly schedule of material reintroduced into production since the initial million charge 
prior quarters st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter acquisitions acquisitions continue to be a key element in the company s growth strategy 
if the company s evaluation of a target company misjudges its technology  estimated future sales and profitability levels  or ability to keep pace with the latest technology  these factors could impair the value of the investment  which could materially adversely affect the company s profitability 
the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in income taxes the company files income tax returns in every jurisdiction in which it has reason to believe it is subject to tax 
historically  the company has been subject to examination by various taxing jurisdictions 
to date  none of these examinations has resulted in any material additional tax 
nonetheless  any tax jurisdiction may contend that a filing position claimed by the company regarding one or more of its transactions is contrary to that jurisdiction s laws or regulations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the guidance contained in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
revenue is recognized when title has passed to the customer  collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable by management  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sale price is fixed and determinable 
historically the company has been successful in mitigating the risks associated with its revenue recognition 
some issues relate to product warranty  credit worthiness of its customers and concentration of sales among a few major customers 
the company is generally obligated to accept returns for defective product or in instances where the product does not meet the company s quality specifications 
if these conditions existed  the company would be obligated to repair or replace the defective product or make a cash settlement with the customer 
if the financial conditions of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances for bad debt may be required which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company has a significant amount of sales with several major customers 
the loss of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
overview bel is a leading producer of electronic products that help make global connectivity a reality 
the company designs  manufactures and markets a broad array of magnetic  modules  circuit protection devices and interconnect products 
while these products are deployed primarily in the computer  networking and telecommunication industries  bel s expanding portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive  medical and consumer electronics markets

bel operates in the electronic component industry a highly competitive industry which has experienced significant declines in product demand in recent years 
actions taken by customers to reduce future orders and to cancel existing orders negatively impacted the company during and and could negatively impact the company in the future 
in recent years  profit margins have been favorably impacted due to various cost cutting measures implemented by the company 
during the company continued to move additional manufacturing and administrative positions from hong kong to china  and new positions to support additional growth were added in china 
with additional volume  the company was able to benefit from better absorption of manufacturing overheads  and managed to minimize increases in raw material costs in markets where costs were rising 
during  sales increased million from the acquisition by the company of insilco s passive components group and apc  and internal growth 
the company acquired the insilco group in late march in the company received proceeds of million from the settlement of a lawsuit  although it also had fixed asset impairment write offs of million plus additional one time and recurring costs associated with the implementation of sarbanes oxley section sarbanes oxley regulations 
during  the provision for income taxes is lower than historical amounts due to the reversal of accruals from prior periods and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credits

percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses fixed asset impairment interest income net lawsuit proceeds earnings before provision for income taxes income tax provision net earnings the following table sets forth the year over year percentage increases of certain items included in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
increase from prior period compared with compared with net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses net earnings sales net sales increased from million during to million during the company attributes a portion of this increase to sales of approximately million from the insilco passive components group during the first quarter of  compared to million during the first quarter of the acquisition took place on march  additionally  the company attributes the increase to strong demand for magnetics sales from bel s existing business  resulting in an increase of million in such sales  increased module sales of million and increased circuit protection sales of million offset in part by decreases in interconnect product sales of million

based on conflicting opinions the company received from customers and competitors in the electronics industry pertaining to revenue growth during  the company can not predict with any degree of certainty sales revenue for this period 
although the company s backlog has been stable  the company feels that this is not a good indicator of revenues 
this statement represents a forward looking statement  subject to the risks and uncertainties described in item of this annual report on form k 
the company continues to have limited visibility as to future customer requirements 
actual results could differ materially from this forward looking statement 
the company had one customer with sales in excess of of total sales during the year ended the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the company cannot quantify the extent of sales growth arising from unit sales mix and or price changes 
given the change in the nature of the products purchased by customers from period to period  the company believes that neither unit changes nor price changes are meaningful 
over the past year  newer and more sophisticated products with higher unit selling prices have been introduced 
through the company s engineering and research effort  the company has been successful in adding additional value to existing product lines  which tends to increase sales prices initially until that generation of products becomes mature and sales prices experience price degradation 
in general  as products become mature  average selling prices decrease 
net sales increased from million during to million during the company attributes this increase principally to sales of approximately million from its two acquisitions in  the insilco passive components group and apc  strong demand for magjack sales from bel s existing business  resulting in an increase of million in such sales  and increased fuse sales of million offset  in part  by a decrease in sales of the module product line of approximately million

see critical accounting policies above for information regarding the use of inventories in the manufacturing process that have been written down in prior years 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from during the year ended december  to in the decrease in the cost of sales percentage is primarily attributable to a decrease in research and development as a percentage of sales and a decrease in direct labor and support as a percentage of sales offset in part by increased raw material costs of 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of sales is more fully discussed below 
the decrease in direct labor and support as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to the lower labor costs associated with the insilco manufacturing operations and the company s relocating direct labor from hong kong to china where labor costs are lower 
the increase in raw material costs is principally related to increased manufacturing of value added products which has a higher raw material content than the company s other products 
the acquisition of the insilco passive components group resulted in additional cost of sales in the amount of million during the first three months of the acquisition took place on march  in the company reduced the manufacturing activities of its fuse department in hong kong and moved those positions to the prc 
in jersey city  mexico  macau and europe  the company reduced headcount 
included in cost of sales are research and development expenses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the principal reasons for the decrease in research and development expense are the closure of the indiana research facility  and lower research and development costs in the far east as many of these jobs were moved by the company from hong kong to china and several positions were eliminated 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from during to in the decrease in the cost of sales percentage is primarily attributable to a decrease in direct labor as a percentage of sales and a decrease in factory overheads 
the decrease in direct labor as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to the lower direct labor costs associated with the insilco manufacturing operations 
the decrease in factory overhead expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to the increase in sales and cost containment measures resulting primarily from the shut down of the company s texas sales  manufacturing and research facility and the company s indiana research facility

the increase is principally attributable to increased research and development expenditures at the company s power products group facilities and the purchase of the passive components group of insilco and apc 
when inventory that has been written off is subsequently used in the manufacturing process  the lower adjusted cost of the material is charged to cost of sales  resulting in a higher gross margin 
during  and  the value of inventory that had been written off and subsequently used in the manufacturing process approximated   and  respectively 
gross profit was not significantly impacted due to comparable deductions in selling prices that were necessary to be competitive 
the company s cost control measures principally involved the closure of its texas sales  manufacturing and research facility during and its indiana research facility  which was closed during the second quarter of a total of employees were terminated at these locations  plus an additional employees were terminated at other us locations

million of severance and employee relocation costs during the year ended fixed asset impairment during the year ended december  the company wrote down fixed assets  principally machinery and equipment  with a net book value of  at its far east manufacturing facilities 
the company considered these fixed assets to be surplus equipment which was replaced by equipment with more advanced technology 
selling  general and administrative expenses the percentage relationship of selling  general and administrative expenses to net sales decreased from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december   in part as a result of the company s ability to leverage general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base 
the company attributes the million increase in the dollar amount of such expenses primarily to increased selling expenses of approximately million which includes salaries  commissions and related expenses 
this increase relates to increased sales 
other cost increases relate to costs associated with insilco operations of approximately million which are included for the entire year as compared with approximately months during in addition  the company incurred a million increase in professional fees  principally related to sarbanes oxley compliance offset in part by

see new financial accounting standards included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information regarding sfas no 
r 
the percentage relationship of selling  general and administrative expenses to net sales decreased from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december   in part as a result of the company s ability to leverage general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base and an impairment charge of million during in connection with the write down of goodwill 
the company attributes the million increase in the dollar amount of such expenses primarily to costs associated with the insilco and apc operations of approximately million  additional salaries and benefits of million  additional professional fees of approximately million and a 
million write off of the building in illinois offset  in part  by the impairment charge of million during in connection with the write down of goodwill  reduced selling expenses of approximately 
million and a reduction in accounts receivable reserves of 
million 
the decrease in selling expenses is attributable to reduced shipping charges and sales salaries resulting from the closing of the texas sales facility 
the increase in salaries and benefits during is principally attributable to bonus  salary and fringe benefit increases  professional fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance  and the acquisition of the insilco passive components group 
reduced sales expenses are principally attributable to reduced shipping costs and commission expenses 
the company anticipates continued increases in professional fees principally associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
future increases in salaries and benefits are more dependent on the future sales growth and profitability of the company 
interest income net interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately  during the year ended december  as compared to the increase is due primarily to increased earnings on higher cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately  during compared to the decrease is due primarily to lower interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalents and lower cash balances due to the use of approximately million of cash for the acquisition of insilco s passive components group and the communications products division of apc

the company experienced increased earnings before income taxes for the year ended december   as compared with the income tax provision is lower than both the statutory federal income tax rate and the prior year provision primarily due to lower foreign tax rates  the reversal of accruals no longer required in the amount of approximately 
million  the utilization of certain tax credits amounting to 
million and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards with a tax effect of approximately 
million  the reduction of deferred taxes previously provided relative to the planned repatriation of foreign earnings of million and the establishment of accruals relative to certain tax matters of million 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in the provision is due primarily to the company s increased earnings before income taxes for the year ended december   as compared with and a valuation allowance of approximately 
million that was established during in connection with foreign net operating losses

the company conducts manufacturing activities in the far east 
more specifically  the company manufactures the majority of its products in the people s republic of china prc  hong kong and macau and has not been subject to corporate income tax in the prc 
the company s activities in hong kong have generally consisted of administration  quality control and accounting  as well as some limited manufacturing activities 
hong kong imposes corporate income tax at a rate of percent solely on income sourced to hong kong 
that is  its tax system is a territorial one which only seeks to tax activities conducted in hong kong 
since the bel entity in hong kong conducts most of its manufacturing and quality control activities in the prc  a portion of this entity s income is deemed offshore and thus not fully taxable in hong kong 
although the statutory tax rate in hong kong is percent  the company generally pays an effective hong kong rate of less than percent 
the company also conducts manufacturing operations in macau 
macau has a statutory corporate income tax rate of percent 
however  the company  as a result of investing in a certain location in macau  was able to obtain a year tax holiday in macau  thereby reducing its effective macau income tax rate from percent to percent 
additionally  the macau subsidiary utilized approximately million of net operating loss carryforward to offset its taxable income during the year ended december  the tax holiday in macau expired in april since most of the company s operations are conducted in the far east  the majority of its profits are sourced in these three far east jurisdictions 
accordingly  the profits earned in the us are comparatively small in relation to its profits reported in the far east 
therefore  there is generally a significant difference between the statutory us tax rate and the company s effective tax rate 
notwithstanding the above  in the company s effective tax rate exceeded the us statutory rate 
this higher effective tax rate results from a combination of factors 
in the company s operating results were close to break even 
this fact  combined with the identification of 
million of foreign earnings that may not be permanently reinvested  as well as the loss in macau for which the company was only able to obtain an percent benefit  resulted in a tax rate in excess of the statutory rate for the company has historically followed a practice of reinvesting a portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the expansion of its foreign operations 
if the unrepatriated earnings were distributed to the parent corporation rather than reinvested in the far east  such funds would be subject to united states federal income taxes 
through december   management has identified a minimum of approximately million of foreign earnings that will be repatriated during and will be eligible for the reduced tax rate of under the american jobs creations act of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the favorable tax treatment afforded the repatriation of cfc earnings and management s decision to repatriate such funds in  the company recorded a  tax benefit in which results from the difference in tax rates between the act and the tax rates previously provided on the portion of cfc earnings which were expected to be repatriated leaving deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately  recorded in such earnings to be repatriated 
in light of the planned repatriation of cfc earnings in  management has identified certain domestic and foreign tax exposures relating to such operations and has used this tax benefit to cover their estimate of this exposure 
such amount has been included in income taxes payable in the accompanying balance sheet 
cost control measures in light of the current market in the company s industry  the company continues to review its operating structures in efforts to control costs 
such measures can be expected to result in a restructuring of the company s operations and the recognition of related restructuring charges in future periods 
during the years ended december   and  the company incurred approximately 
million  
million and 
million  respectively  of severance costs and does not anticipate additional severance expenses during inflation and foreign currency exchange during the past two years  the effect of inflation on the company s profitability was not material 
historically  fluctuations of the us dollar against other major currencies have not significantly affected the company s foreign operations as most sales have been denominated in us dollars or currencies directly or indirectly linked to the us dollar 
most significant expenses  including raw materials  labor and manufacturing expenses  are either incurred in us dollars or the currencies of the hong kong dollar  the macau pataca or the chinese renminbi 
commencing with the acquisition of the passive components group  the company s european entity has sales transactions which are denominated principally in euros and british pounds 
conversion of these transactions into us dollars has resulted in currency exchange losses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively which are included in selling  general and administrative expense and approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  in unrealized exchange losses relating to the translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements which are included in other comprehensive income 
any change in linkage of the us dollar and the hong kong dollar  the chinese renminbi or the macau pataca could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operating activities 
currently  due to the recent acquisition of the passive components group of insilco technologies  inc  the company has borrowed money under a secured term loan and has unused lines of credit as described below 
management believes that the cash flow from operations after payments of dividends and scheduled repayments of the term loan  combined with its existing capital base and the company s available lines of credit  will be sufficient to fund its operations for the near term 
such statement constitutes a forward looking statement 
factors which could cause the company to require additional capital include  among other things  a softening in the demand for the company s existing products  an inability to respond to customer demand for new products  potential acquisitions requiring substantial capital  future expansion of the company s operations and net losses that would result in net cash being used in operating  investing and or financing activities which result in net decreases in cash and cash equivalents 
net losses may result in the loss of domestic and foreign credit facilities and preclude the company from raising debt or equity financing in the capital markets 
the company has one domestic line of credit amounting to million  which was unused at december  during march  the company borrowed million against the line of credit to partially finance the acquisition of galaxy 
the million line of credit expires on march  and is in addition to the company s million term loan described below 
borrowings under this million line of credit are secured by the same assets  which secure the term loan described below 
the line of credit bears interest at libor plus percent 
on march   the company entered into a million secured term loan 
the loan was used to partially finance the company s acquisition of insilco s passive components group 
the loan agreement requires equal quarterly installments of principal with a final maturity on march  and bears interest at libor plus percent percent at december  payable quarterly 
the loan is collateralized with a first priority security interest in of all the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of certain of the foreign subsidiaries of bel fuse inc and all other personal property and certain real property of bel fuse inc the company is required to maintain certain financial covenants  as defined in the agreement 
for the years ended december  and  the company recorded interest expense of approximately  and  respectively  and was in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the loan agreement as of december  the company s hong kong subsidiary has an unsecured line of credit of approximately million  which was unused at december  this line of credit expires on april  borrowing on this line of credit is guaranteed by the company
