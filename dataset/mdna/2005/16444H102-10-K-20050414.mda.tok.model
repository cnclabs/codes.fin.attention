overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
since may  we have principally been in the business of marketing and licensing the cherokee brand and related trademarks and other brands we own or represent 
our operating strategy emphasizes domestic and international retail direct and wholesale licensing  whereby we grant wholesalers and retailers the license to use our trademarks on certain categories of merchandise 
in november  we reaffirmed our strategic relationship with target stores  a division of target corp  by entering into the amended target agreement  which grants target stores the exclusive right in the united states to use the cherokee trademarks in certain categories of merchandise 
see item business united states licensing 
under the amended target agreement  target stores will pay a royalty each fiscal year during the term of the agreement based on a percentage of target stores net sales of cherokee branded merchandise during each fiscal year  which percentage varies according to the volume of sales of merchandise 
in any event  target stores has agreed to pay a minimum guaranteed royalty of million for the fiscal years ending february  and january   and million for the year ended january  and each fiscal year thereafter  if any  that the term of amended target agreement is extended 
in february  target stores elected to allow the term of the amended target agreement to be renewed for one additional year 
as a result  the term of the amended target agreement currently continues until january  and remains subject to the automatic renewal provisions 
under the amended target agreement  in most cases  we or spell c must receive target stores consent to enter into additional licensing agreements in the united states with respect to the cherokee brand during the term of the agreement 
therefore  our current focus with respect to the cherokee brand is to continue to develop that brand in several international markets through retail direct or wholesale licenses with manufacturers or other companies that have market power and economies of scale in the respective markets 
target stores currently has approximately  stores in the united states and has publicly announced that it expects to open additional stores in the next twelve months 
we hope that these additional stores will result in an increase in the overall sales volume of cherokee branded products sold by target stores  however  there can be no assurance that overall sales volume will increase 
sales of cherokee branded product at target stores declined in fiscal by to billion  which we attribute to changes in the mix and placement of cherokee branded products within target stores 
target stores pays royalty revenues to us based on a percentage of its sales of cherokee branded products 
the amended target agreement  however  is structured to provide royalty rate reductions for target stores after it has achieved certain levels of retail sales of cherokee branded products during each fiscal year 
in fiscal target stores reached the maximum royalty rate reduction in the third quarter 
we believe that for fiscal our royalty revenues from target stores will continue to be somewhat flat or similar to that achieved in fiscal  and we are not able to predict how this trend may specifically impact our quarterly revenues 
however  pursuant to our contractual royalty rate reductions as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved  in terms of future royalty revenues that we expect to receive from target  we expect that our first quarter will continue to be our largest quarter  our second quarter to be our next largest quarter  our fourth quarter to be our next largest quarter  and our third quarter to be our smallest quarter which is consistent with our historical results 
as part of a recapitalization that occurred in september  we sold to spell c  our wholly owned subsidiary  all of our rights to the cherokee brand and related trademarks in the united states and assigned to spell c all of our rights in the amended target agreement in exchange for the proceeds from the sale of the secured notes 
see item business recapitalization  sale of cherokee trademarks to spell c  issuance of secured notes 
on december   spell c issued for gross proceeds of million  privately placed zero coupon secured notes the secured notes  yielding interest per annum and maturing on february  the proceeds from the sale of the secured notes were used to pay a special dividend to cherokee stockholders 
the secured notes subsequently have been paid in full out of royalties received under the amended target agreement  with the final payment of principal and interest being made on february  during fiscal  of the million in royalty revenues from target stores  million was paid to the holders of the secured notes  and the remainder of the royalty revenues were distributed to us 
spell c will continue to receive all royalties paid under the amended target agreement but we expect all such royalties will be distributed to cherokee 
target stores commenced the initial sales of cherokee branded merchandise in july royalty revenues from our cherokee brand at target stores were million during fiscal  million during fiscal  million during fiscal  million during fiscal  and million during fiscal  which accounted for    and respectively  of our consolidated revenues during such periods 
while all royalties paid under the amended target agreement appear in our consolidated financial statements  since the issuance of the secured notes in until their maturity on february   a large percentage of such royalties were distributed to the holders of the secured notes 
during fiscal  of the million in royalty revenues received from target stores  million was paid to the holders of the secured notes 
this million was the final payment due to the holders of the secured notes  and the secured notes were retired on february  the revenues generated from all other licensing agreements during fiscal were million  during fiscal were million  during fiscal were million  during fiscal were million  and during fiscal were million  which accounted for    and  respectively  of our revenues during such periods 
in november  we purchased the sideout brand and related trademarks from sideout sport  inc for approximately million and a portion of the future royalties generated by the sideout brand 
under the terms of the sideout agreement  we agreed to pay sideout sport inc on a quarterly basis  of the first million  of the next million and of the next million  of royalties and license fees received by us through licensing of the sideout trademarks 
upon the earlier of such time as we have paid sideout total contingent payments of million or october   we will have no further obligation to pay sideout sport inc during fiscal  we made additional contingent payments of million under the sideout agreement  with the last payment under this agreement being made in our third quarter ended october  since january  we have paid  in total  approximately million in contingent payments under the sideout agreement 
the sideout brand generated licensing revenues from existing contracts of approximately million during fiscal  which accounted for approximately of our revenues during such period 
see item business sideout agreement 
as an incentive for our licensees to achieve higher retail sales of cherokee or sideout branded products  many of our existing license agreements  including the amended target agreement  are structured to provide royalty rate reductions for the licensees after they achieve certain levels of retail sales of cherokee or sideout branded products during each fiscal year 
the royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the year 
as a result  our royalty revenues as a percentage of our licensees retail sales of branded products are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease throughout each fiscal year as licensees reach certain retail sales thresholds contained in their respective license agreements 
therefore  the amount of royalty revenue received by us in any quarter is dependent not only on retail sales of branded products in such quarter  but also on the cumulative level of retail sales  and the resulting attainment of royalty rate reductions in any preceding quarters in the same fiscal year 
the size of the royalty rate reductions and the level of retail sales at which they are achieved vary in each licensing agreement 
in december  we acquired out of bankruptcy the trademarks of cl fashion inc which included carole little  clii  saint tropez west  chorus line  all that jazz  and molly malloy for an aggregate purchase price of million 
concurrently  we entered into a five year licensing agreement with tjx companies for the carole little  clii and saint tropez west brands and a five year master licensing agreement with gilrichco  inc for the remaining brands 
the gilrichco agreement was terminated in october the financial impact of the early termination was not material to our results of operations or cash flows 
the licensing agreement with tjx provides us with minimum guaranteed annual royalties during the term of the agreement and provides tjx with the option at the expiration of the initial term of the agreement to either renew the agreement for an additional five years or buy the trademarks covered by the agreement from us pursuant to an agreed upon formula 
after we recover our investment of million from the carole little brands carole little  clii and saint tropez west then of any additional monies received from the carole little brands must be paid by us to ms 
carole little studiocl corporation  the founder of cl fashion inc in addition to licensing our own brands  we assist other companies in identifying licensees for their brands 
for example  during fiscal we assisted mossimo inc in locating target stores as a licensee of the mossimo brand and entered into a finder s agreement with mossimo  which provides that we will receive a fixed percentage of all monies paid to mossimo by target stores 
under mossimo s agreement with target stores  target stores is obligated to pay mossimo a royalty based on a percentage of net sales of mossimo branded products  with a minimum guaranteed royalty  beginning in  of approximately million over the initial three year term of the agreement 
mossimo s agreement with target stores is subject to early termination under certain circumstances 
in february  the agreement between mossimo and target was renewed until january   but continues to contain early termination provisions 
during fiscal and  we recognized revenues from mossimo of million and million  respectively  but mossimo refused to pay such amounts 
we instituted arbitration against mossimo to collect the amount of finder s fees owed to us  together with interest on such amounts  which arbitration and lawsuit eventually led to a judgment in our favor for collection of all such amounts 
see item business other businesses and brand opportunities 
we also have provided our brand representation services for other brands  including housebeautiful and latina 
as of november   we and the newstar group  d b a the wilstar group wilstar entered into a second revised and restated management agreement which revised and restated the terms under which wilstar agreed to continue to provide us with the executive management services of our chief executive officer robert margolis 
mr 
margolis is currently the sole stockholder of wilstar 
on january   wilstar assigned the management agreement to mr 
margolis 
pursuant to the terms of the management agreement  mr 
margolis is to receive a base salary which is subject to annual cost of living increases 
during fiscal mr 
margolis base salary totaled  mr 
margolis is also eligible for annual performance bonuses 
the management agreement provides that  for each fiscal year after fiscal  if our ebitda for such fiscal year is no less than million  then mr 
margolis will receive a performance bonus equal to of our ebitda for such fiscal year in excess of million up to million  plus of our ebitda for such fiscal year in excess of million 
as a result  for fiscal we accrued a bonus of million for mr 
margolis  and if our ebitda continues to increase  the bonus payable to mr 
margolis under the management agreement will also increase 
in  our board changed our fiscal year end to a or week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest to january in order to better align us with our licensees who generally also operate and plan using such a fiscal year 
prior to this change our fiscal year was a or week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest may as a result  our fiscal year fiscal ended february  and included weeks  our fiscal year fiscal ended february  and included weeks  our fiscal year fiscal ended february  and includes weeks  our fiscal fiscal ended january  and included weeks  and our fiscal fiscal ended january  and included weeks 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  deferred taxes  impairment of long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management applies the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition policy 
revenues from royalty and finders agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from our licensees 
our royalty recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned  although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter 
revenues are not recognized unless collectibility is reasonably assured 
deferred taxes 
deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance management considers estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
that generally requires management to assess these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets 
contingencies and litigation 
we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
management makes these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel 
stock options 
as permitted under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees in accounting for our stock options and other stock based employee awards 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share  as calculated under the provisions of sfas  are disclosed in note of the notes to the financial statements 
if we had elected to recognize compensation expense for employee awards based upon the fair value at the grant date consistent with the methodology prescribed by sfas  our net income for the fiscal years ended january   january   and february  would have been reduced by   and  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain of our consolidated financial data 
year ended january  year ended january  year ended february  royalty revenues selling  general  administrative and amortization expenses operating income interest income expense and other income  net income tax provision net income fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  our revenues increased to million from million for fiscal revenues for fiscal and fiscal were generated from licensing our trademarks to retailers and wholesalers  and also from representing other brands in licensing agreements 
revenues from our cherokee brand at target stores for fiscal and fiscal were million or of revenues and million or of revenues  respectively 
revenues from all other sources for fiscal and fiscal were million or of revenues and million or of revenues  respectively 
in fiscal  mervyn s revenues declined for the sideout brand and mervyn s paid royalties of approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal our international licensing revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cherokee products were launched in tesco stores in fall and carrefour stores in spring revenue from tesco uk and ireland was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal revenue from carrefour stores was million in fiscal and million in fiscal zellers paid royalties of approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal due to lower sales volume of cherokee branded products 
in fiscal  our revenues included million from mossimo inc compared to million for fiscal in addition  as described previously  we favorably settled our lawsuit with mossimo during fiscal and received all of the past finder s fees from mossimo which were previously outstanding  along with reimbursement of nearly all of our legal expenses and we also received interest income calculated upon the statutory legal rate of interest upon the outstanding amounts 
see item legal proceedings 
during fiscal  royalty revenues from various other retail direct and wholesale licensing agreements totaled million as compared to million in fiscal we believe that our future revenues from target and zeller s may remain relatively stable to those reported in fiscal  but we do not have direct oversight or involvement in the manufacturing  marketing or sales of the ultimate branded product  and hence do not have the information necessary to determine or predict the specific reasons why revenue may increase or decrease in any given future period 
we are unsure how our future revenues from mervyn s will trend  as target recently sold mervyn s to a private equity group  which may decide to sell off some of the mervyn s locations 
however  during fiscal mervyn s extended our contract for an additional years  until january  based on tesco s growth in sales of cherokee branded products in the last year and tesco s expressed interest in continuing to promote the cherokee brand in several new territories  we believe that our future revenues from tesco may continue to grow 
our revenue recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter royalties are earned  although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter 
our trade receivable balances of million and million at the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively  included an accrual for royalty revenues earned during the fourth quarters of fiscal and fiscal and these revenues were subsequently received in the following quarter 
our trade receivable balance at the end of fiscal also included over million in outstanding accounts receivable for mossimo  which we subsequently received in our first and second quarters of fiscal all of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in us dollars 
as a consequence  the recent weakening of the us dollar has benefited us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees such as tesco  zellers and carrefour increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies the british pound  the canadian dollar  and the euro 
for example  the royalty revenues from tesco for fiscal reflect a favorable change in the weighted average exchange rate for fiscal as compared to the weighted average exchange rate used in the comparable period last year 
in the future  should the dollar strengthen against such foreign currencies  the total royalty revenues reported by us from such licensees would reflect such changes in the currency exchange rates 
accordingly  a strengthening dollar  compared to current exchange rates  may result in lower reported royalty revenues from our international licensees 
selling  general and administrative expenses including amortization of trademarks for fiscal were million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were below that of fiscal  and included the following changes i total bonus expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  ii there were less than  of severance expenses for fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  iii expenses pertaining to compliance with sarbanes oxley section during fiscal totaled approximately  as compared to in fiscal  iv amortization of our trademarks for fiscal increased to million from  in fiscal  and v total marketing expenses increased by about  in fiscal as compared to that incurred in fiscal in addition  we incurred significantly lower legal expenses in fiscal of approximately  as compared to the fiscal total legal expenses of over  the majority of which was related to the mossimo lawsuit which was settled favorably in fiscal see overview  item legal proceedings 
amortization expenses are expected to increase as a result of the acquisition of the cl fashion trademarks  the sideout contingent payments which ended with our last payment in our third quarter ended october   and the continuing purchase of other trademarks and registration and renewal fees that are capitalized 
management and staff bonus expenses will continue to rise if our ebitda continues to rise 
our interest expense for fiscal was negligible  as compared to million in fiscal the interest expense in fiscal is attributable to the interest on the secured notes which were retired in february and the amortization of costs incurred in establishing our new bank credit facility 
the interest expense for fiscal was attributable to the secured notes and the amortization of securitization fees 
we may incur modest amounts of future interest expense depending upon the amount of future bank debt outstanding under our million bank agreement entered into in march our investment  interest and other income for fiscal was  as compared to  for fiscal the increase in investment and interest income is due to interest awarded by the court on the amounts owed by mossimo  and also the reimbursement of certain legal expenses previously incurred in relation to the mossimo legal proceedings 
see item legal proceedings 
for fiscal  we booked for generally accepted accounting principles a tax provision of million  or per diluted share  compared to million or per diluted share for fiscal our effective tax rate was  for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the company obtaining approval from the california franchise tax board for classification as a franchisor for state franchise tax reporting purposes 
this characterization allows certain income to be excluded from california state income tax 
this change had two effects on the effective tax rate in fiscal i the company received refunds of approximately  for previously paid taxes for the years that were open under the statute of limitations  which amount was partially offset by federal income tax due on the state tax refunds  and ii the tax provision for fiscal tax returns and fiscal tax was computed to conform to the new tax reporting method

no decision has been made as to whether the company will engage in a transaction or transactions resulting from the board s consideration of strategic alternatives  and there can be no assurance that any transaction or transactions will occur or  if undertaken  the terms or timing thereof 
we are frequently approached by parties seeking to sell their brands and related trademarks

e after we recover our investment of million from the carole little brands carole little  clii and saint tropez west  then of any additional monies received from the carole little brands must be paid by us to ms 
carole little studiocl corporation  the founder of cl fashion inc we cannot predict the exact amount of payments we will be obligated to make to ms 
little or when such payments may be due 
as of january  we had remaining costs of million of our investment which had not yet been recovered 
if royalty revenues collected from tjx continue at their current levels  we believe we would recover our remaining costs in approximately years 
hence  we currently project that beginning in the year our fiscal we will begin having to pay of the royalty revenues received from the carole little brands to ms 
carole little

on december   spell c issued the secured notes  which yield interest per annum and mature on february  see item recapitalization  sale of cherokee trademarks to spell c  issuance of secured notes 
the proceeds from the sale of the secured notes were used to pay a special dividend to cherokee stockholders at that time 
the secured notes subsequently have been paid in full out of royalties received under the amended target agreement  with the final payment of principal and interest being made on february  during fiscal  we announced and paid dividends of per share  including a one time special dividend of per share in may in january we declared a dividend of per share  which was paid in march since december  we have paid a cash dividend to our shareholders for six straight quarters 
however  the payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board and will be dependant upon our financial conditions  results of operations  capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board 
in the future  from time to time  our board of directors may declare additional dividends depending upon cherokee s financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by cherokee s board of directors 
sources of liquidity 
our primary source of liquidity is expected to be cash flow generated from operations  and cash and cash equivalents currently on hand 
we believe our cash flow from operations together with our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and other commitments though the end of fiscal  provided that  if the management agreement was terminated as discussed above  we would not have sufficient cash to make the lump sum payment to mr 
margolis 
see item business risk factors we cannot predict our revenues and cash flow generated from operations 
some of the factors that could cause our revenues and cash flows to be materially lower are described under the caption titled risk factors in item of this form k and under the caption title cautionary note regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this item as of january  we did not have any amounts outstanding under any credit facilities or lines of credit and we are not the guarantor of the secured notes or any other material third party obligations 
as of january   we do not have any standby letters of credit nor any standby repurchase obligations 
in march we entered into a new million secured loan agreement the new bank facility with us bank national association us bank  which currently expires on july  this new bank facility was entered into to provide us with greater working capital flexibility and liquidity for general corporate purposes  including the potential acquisition of brands or related properties which may be for sale 
we may extend this new bank facility until july if our revenues and cash flows during fiscal are lower than fiscal  we may not have cash available to continue to pay dividends  repurchase shares of our common stock or to explore or consummate the acquisition of other brands 
if our revenues and cash flows during fiscal are materially lower than fiscal  we may need to take steps to reduce expenditures by scaling back operations and reducing staff related to these activities 
however  any reduction of revenues would be partially offset by reductions in the amounts we would be required to pay under the management agreement  employee bonuses  and other expenses 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash generated from our business activities to support our operations for the next twelve months 
inflation and changing prices inflation  traditionally  has not had a significant effect on our operations 
since most of our future revenues are based upon a percentage of sales of the licensed products by our licensees  we do not anticipate that inflation will have a material impact on future operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment which amends sfas statement and will be effective for public companies for interim periods or annual periods beginning after june  the new standard will require the company to recognize compensation costs in our financial statements in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted to employees and directors 
the company is currently evaluating how it will adopt the standard and evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas r will have on its financial position and results of operations 
in december  the sec issued sab this staff accounting bulletin revises or rescinds certain sections of sab  which gives interpretation guidance about revenue recognition 
sab makes the interpretive guidance of sab consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the adoption of sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal did not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations

qualitative and quantitative disclosures of market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest from time to time we invest our excess cash in interest bearing temporary investments of high quality issuers 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to us 
previously  our only long term debt obligations were the secured notes  which are zero coupon secured notes yielding interest of interest per annum  and which were retired on february  we currently do not have any long term debt obligations 
foreign currency we conduct business in various parts of the world 
we are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates to the extent that the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuates in countries where our licensees do business 
revenues from international licensees comprise of our consolidated revenues during fiscal for fiscal  a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies of countries where we operate would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flow
