item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops  markets and sells both generic and proprietary or branded pharmaceutical products 
we have a deep  diverse and profitable generic product portfolio  and have diversified our operations by developing and acquiring several proprietary products 
sales of generic products accounted for of our product sales in fiscal  while sales of our proprietary products grew from million in fiscal  accounting for just of our product sales that year  to million in fiscal  accounting for of product sales 
generic products for many years  we have successfully utilized a strategy of developing the generic versions of branded products that possess some combination of unique factors that we believe have the effect of limiting competition for generics 
such factors include difficult formulation  complex and costly manufacturing requirements or limited raw material availability 
to date  our strategy has focused on developing solid oral dosage forms of products 
by targeting products with some combination of these unique factors  we believe that our generic products will  in general  be less affected by the intense and rapid pricing pressure often associated with more commodity type generic products 
as a result of this focused strategy  we have been able to successfully identify  develop and market generic products that generally have few competitors or that are able to enjoy longer periods of limited competition and thus generate profit margins higher than those often associated with commodity type generic products 
the development and launch of our generic oral contraceptive products is an example of our generic development strategy 
while we believe there are more tablet and capsule products that may fit our barrier to entry criteria  we recognize that finding highly profitable generic tablet and capsule products that will grow our generics business is difficult 
as a result  we have recently expanded our development resources to include non tablet and capsule products such as patches  sterile ophthalmics and nasal sprays 
challenging the patents covering certain brand products continues to be an important component of our generic strategy 
for many products  the patent provides the unique barrier that we seek to identify in our product selection process 
we try to be the first company to initiate a patent challenge because in certain cases  we may be able to obtain days of exclusivity for selling the generic version of the product 
for example  this occurred with fluoxetine  our generic version of eli lilly s prozac 
if we do receive exclusivity for a product  we typically experience significant revenues and profitability associated with that product for the six month exclusivity period  but at the end of that period experience significant decreases in our revenues and market share associated with the product as other generic competitors enter the market 
this happened with our fluoxetine product after expiration of our generic exclusivity period 
our record of successfully resolving patent challenges has contributed to our growth  but has created periods of revenue and earnings volatility and will likely do so in the future 
while earnings and cash flow volatility may result from the launch of products subject to patent challenges  we remain committed to this part of our business 
macroeconomic factors also continue to favor the use of generic pharmaceutical products 
the aging population  rising health care costs and the vigilance of health care providers  insurance companies and others to lower such costs have helped drive an increase in the substitution of lower cost generic products for higher cost brand products 
as evidence of this  the percentage of overall prescriptions filled with generic products grew from in to by  and is predicted to continue to rise in the future 
proprietary products to help diversify our existing revenue base and to provide for additional long term opportunities  we initiated a program more than five years ago to develop and market proprietary pharmaceutical products 
we formalized this program in by establishing duramed research 
today we have a substantial number of employees dedicated to the development and marketing of our proprietary products including approximately sales representatives that promote directly to physicians four of our products and two products related to the co promotion agreement with kos pharmaceuticals 
in addition  we sell but do not actively market seven other proprietary products 

table of contents growth in proprietary product sales over the last three fiscal years has been accomplished through product acquisitions and through higher sales of our first internally developed proprietary product  seasonale 
competition one of our greatest challenges is continuing to stay ahead of the competition  both for generic and proprietary products 
our successful generic product strategy has attracted new competitors seeking to launch competing generic products as well as to be first to file for potentially lucrative patent challenges 
for example  other generic pharmaceutical companies have recently started developing and marketing competing generic oral contraceptives in order to capture some of our market share 
in addition  there has been an increase in the number of competitors in the generic industry that are based outside us  with several of such competitors based in india 
many of these companies claim to have equivalent technological capabilities to us based generic companies but at significant cost advantages over their us counterparts 
also  as a detriment to the value of the patent challenge strategy of barr and other leading generic manufacturers  brand pharmaceutical companies continue to partner with certain generic drug companies to license a so called authorized generic to the generic drug company 
the use of authorized generics by certain brand and generic companies undermines the value of the day exclusivity period enjoyed by the first company to file an anda containing a paragraph iv certification by providing another company with the ability to have the generic product on the market at the same time 
finally  as our proprietary pharmaceutical products grow  we anticipate that competing generic pharmaceutical companies will challenge the patents protecting our branded products 
for example  one of our competitors  watson  has filed a paragraph iv certification challenging the patent on seasonale 
to address these and other challenges  we continue to invest aggressively in research and development  develop and launch new generic and proprietary products and maintain an active acquisition and licensing effort to complement our internal development activities 
comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and june  the following table sets forth revenue data for the fiscal years ended june  and s in millions change generic products distributed alternative brands oral contraceptives other generic total generic products proprietary products total product sales alliance  development and other revenue total revenues reflects sales of ciprofloxacin sold during bayer s pediatric exclusivity period which ended on june  includes sales of ciprofloxacin after june  
table of contents revenues product sales product sales for the year ended june  decreased as compared to the prior year primarily due to the expected decline in sales of our distributed version of ciprofloxacin  as discussed in detail below 
partially offsetting the decrease in ciprofloxacin sales was a significant increase in sales of our proprietary products 
generic products distributed alternative brands ciprofloxacin on june  we began distributing ciprofloxacin hydrochloride tablets and oral suspension pursuant to a license from bayer corporation obtained under a settlement of a patent challenge we initiated regarding bayer s cipro antibiotic 
in september  we entered into an amended supply agreement with bayer that enabled us to distribute ciprofloxacin during and after bayer s period of pediatric exclusivity  which ended on june  as a result of the exclusivity we enjoyed  ciprofloxacin was our largest selling product in fiscal we have shared and continued to share one half of our profits  as defined  from the sale of ciprofloxacin with aventis  the contractual successor to our partner in the cipro patent challenge case 
upon expiration of bayer s period of pediatric exclusivity on june   as expected  several other competing ciprofloxacin products were launched 
as a result of the flood of competing products  our market share and product pricing declined dramatically for ciprofloxacin almost immediately 
since the expiration of the exclusivity period  we have included sales of ciprofloxacin in the other generic line item in the table above 
such sales were not significant for fiscal oral contraceptives sales of our generic oral contraceptive products decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal price declines and lower volumes resulting from additional competitors reduced sales on certain of our products  mainly apri and aviane  and a slowdown in the growth rate of generic substitution more than offset full year contributions from products launched during fiscal  two new products launched in fiscal and market share gains on other existing products 
oral contraceptives are the most common method of reversible birth control  used by up to of women in the united states at some time during their reproductive years 
oral contraceptives have a long history with widespread use attributed to many factors including efficacy in preventing pregnancy  safety and simplicity in initiation and discontinuation  medical benefits and relatively low incidence of side effects 
from fiscal to fiscal  sales of our generic oral contraceptive products more than quadrupled 
this growth was fueled by new product launches  the addition of new customers and by increasing rates of generic substitution 
we currently manufacture and market generic oral contraceptive products under trade names  two of which we launched during the fiscal year ended june  this portfolio now represents nearly all oral contraceptives that are eligible for generics 
additionally  the growth in generic substitution rates for this heavily genericized portfolio of products slowed  even as we continued to gain market share on certain products within the portfolio 
we anticipate that these trends will continue in fiscal as competitors launch new products and as the portfolio continues to experience a slowing of overall growth in generic substitution 
however  despite our expectation that sales of our generic oral contraceptive portfolio will decline in fiscal versus fiscal  we believe that we are well positioned to maintain market share for many of our products and that our portfolio of oral contraceptives will continue to be a significant component of our revenues in fiscal generic products other sales of other generic products decreased in fiscal as compared to the prior year period  as sales from new products launched since the end of last year  including didanosine and metformin xr mg  were more than offset by declines in other existing product sales 
the decline in other existing product sales was primarily due to a significant decrease in sales of our dextroamphetamine group of products due to both declining volumes and lower prices caused by the launch of competing versions in late in april  our generic exclusivity period on metformin xr mg ended and several other generic companies launched competing versions of the product 
as a result  we experienced a significant decline in sales of metformin xr mg and would expect that decline to continue during fiscal however  we expect that higher sales of didanosine and sales from our generic version of ddavp  which we launched in july  will more than offset these declines leading to higher sales of our other generic products in 
table of contents fiscal proprietary products sales of our proprietary products almost doubled in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
this increase relates primarily to higher sales of seasonale  which totaled million for the fiscal year  reflecting higher unit sales in support of prescription growth and higher pricing compared to last year  full year sales of loestrin loestrin fe and plan b which we acquired in february and march  respectively  and sales of nordette and prefest  which we acquired in november and december  respectively 
seasonale prescriptions  according to ims data  topped  for our fiscal year ended june   a increase over prescriptions in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is a direct result of our significant marketing initiatives  including direct to consumer advertising and the detailing efforts by our women s healthcare sales force 
while we look for growth in fiscal for seasonale prescriptions and sales  we expect much lower growth rates than those achieved in fiscal we have been active in acquiring proprietary products over the last two fiscal years and the contribution from those products has increased our proprietary revenues substantially over that period 
certain of the products which we have acquired no longer enjoy patent protection and are experiencing declining prescription volumes 
as a result  while these products are expected to still generate healthy margins and predictable cash flows  we do not expect them to generate the year over year sales growth we experienced in fiscal in fact  some may show year over year decreases in sales 
as a result  growth in our proprietary product sales in fiscal will be mainly dependent on growth in seasonale  cenestin and plan b  and the launch of our enjuvia product during the second half of fiscal cost of sales our cost of sales includes the cost of products we purchase from third parties  our manufacturing and packaging costs for products we manufacture  profit sharing or royalty payments made to third parties  including raw material suppliers and any changes to our inventory reserve 
amortization costs arising from the acquisition of product rights and our distribution costs are included in selling  general and administrative costs 
product mix plays a significant role in our quarterly and annual overall gross margin percentage 
in the past  our overall gross margins have been negatively impacted by sales of lower margin distributed versions of products such as ciprofloxacin and tamoxifen  which were manufactured for us by brand companies and distributed by us under the terms of the respective patent challenge settlement arrangements 
the following table sets forth cost of sales data in dollars as well as the resulting gross margins  for the two years ended june  and s in millions change generic products gross margin proprietary products gross margin total cost of sales gross margin the decrease in total cost of sales  on a dollar basis  for the year ended june   as compared to the prior year  was primarily due to the year over year decrease in sales of ciprofloxacin  which in the prior year we had purchased from bayer 

table of contents margins on our generic products increased significantly in fiscal due mainly to the decrease in year over year distributed ciprofloxacin sales 
as a distributed product for which we shared the profits with our partner in the cipro patent challenge  ciprofloxacin had a higher cost of sales and a lower margin than our other products 
margins on our proprietary products increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased sales of higher margin products  primarily seasonale and loestrin loestrin fe 
selling  general and administrative expense the following table sets forth selling  general and administrative expense data for the two years ended june  and s in millions change selling  general and administrative charges included in general and administrative lower selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to last year were primarily due to lower charges compared to charges partially offset by million in higher marketing costs in fiscal associated with our proprietary product portfolio and million in higher product intangible amortization expense in fiscal due to full year amortization on products purchased in the prior year and amortization of products purchased in the current year 
charges taken in the twelve months ended june  and are as follows fiscal a million valuation allowance we established in september for our loans to natural biologics  llc  the raw material supplier for our generic equine based conjugated estrogens product  as the result of an unfavorable court decision rendered in september  the february write off of million associated with the acquisition of certain emergency contraception assets from gynetics  inc  an arbitration panel s decision in june to award solvay pharmaceuticals  inc million in damages on a claim that we improperly terminated an agreement with solvay  and an million charge in june related to costs associated with our settlement of the estrostep and femhrt patent challenge litigation against galen 
fiscal on june  we entered into a non binding letter of intent loi with organon ireland ltd  organon usa and savient pharmaceuticals  inc to acquire the nda for mircette  obtain an exclusive royalty free license to sell mircette and kariva in the united states and dismiss all pending litigation between the parties in exchange for a payment by us of up to million 
the parties will not be contractually bound unless and until they negotiate and execute definitive agreements 
if consummated  the transaction would permit us to promote mircette through our duramed sales force  which could increase sales of both mircette and kariva 
if the transaction is not consummated  we expect to continue to vigorously defend our position in the mircette litigation 
in july  the parties made the required filings with the federal trade commission ftc regarding the proposed transaction 
on august   the ftc issued a second request  asking the parties to provide detailed information concerning the proposed transaction 

table of contents the proposed transaction is contingent upon both satisfactory completion of the ftc s hart scott rodino review and the negotiation of mutually satisfactory definitive agreements 
however  because the proposed transaction includes  as one of its components  a payment in settlement of litigation  it is presumed under gaap to give rise to a probable loss  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in consultation with outside advisors and based on preliminary valuations of the assets we would acquire if the transaction closes on the terms presently contemplated  we have recorded a charge of million as of june  to reflect the proposed litigation settlement 
we may reverse the charge  in whole or in part  in the future if the transaction does not close and we prevail in the litigation or are ultimately held liable for a lesser amount of damages 
if the transaction does not close and an unfavorable verdict were to be rendered against us at trial  the ultimate amount of damages payable by us could be significantly more or less than the million charge we have recorded in connection with the propose litigation settlement 
research and development the following table sets forth research and development expenses for the two years ended june  and s in millions change research and development charges included in research and development for the year ended june  our total research and development costs reflected charges relating to strategic acquisitions or similar activities including a write off of million in march resulting from our agreement to acquire schering s rights and obligations under a product development and license agreement that had been capitalized at the time of our acquisition of enhance pharmaceuticals  inc in june  a write off of million for in process research and development acquired in connection with our acquisition of women s capital corporation in february  and a write off of million of in process research and development costs in connection with our purchase of substantially all of the assets of endeavor pharmaceuticals  inc in november the remaining million increase in research and development for the year ended june  as compared to the prior year was primarily due to million in higher third party development costs  including a million payment to pliva related to the development  supply and marketing agreement that we entered into in march for the generic biopharmaceutical granulocyte colony stimulating factor g csf  million in higher bioequivalence study costs  reflecting both an increase in the number and the cost of the studies  million in higher internal production costs in support of internal development projects  and million in higher headcount costs in support of the increased number of products in development 
income taxes the following table sets forth income tax expense and the resulting effective tax rate stated as a percentage of pre tax income for the two years ended june  and s in millions change income tax expense effective tax rate 
table of contents the effective tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by the completion of several tax audits  the change of the mix in income between various taxing jurisdictions and the enactment of favorable tax legislation in certain jurisdictions 
as indicated above  we have recently completed an audit by the irs for our federal income tax returns for fiscal years and the resolution favorably impacted our effective tax rate for the fiscal year but did not have a material effect on our financial position or liquidity 
periods prior to have either been audited or are no longer subject to audit 
we are currently being audited by the irs for our fiscal year ended june  comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and june  the following table sets forth revenue data for the fiscal years ended june  and s in millions change generic products distributed alternative brands ciprofloxacin tamoxifen oral contraceptives other generic total generic products proprietary products total product sales alliance  development and other revenue total revenues distributed alternative brands are distributed by us under terms of agreements entered into as part of patent challenge settlements 
therefore  for reporting purposes  they are classified as generic products 
refects sales of tamoxifen acquired from innovator 
includes sales of tamoxifen manufactured by barr 
revenues product sales product sales for the year ended june  increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to the sales of our distributed version of ciprofloxacin and to increased sales of our generic and proprietary products  which more than offset the large decline in sales of our distributed version of tamoxifen 
generic products ciprofloxacin on june   we began distributing ciprofloxacin hydrochloride tablets and oral suspension pursuant to a license from bayer obtained under a settlement of a patent challenge we initiated against bayer s cipro antibiotic 
in september  we signed an amended supply agreement with bayer that enabled us to distribute ciprofloxacin during and after bayer s period of pediatric exclusivity  which ended on june  as a result  ciprofloxacin was our largest selling product in fiscal we have shared one half of our profits  as defined  
table of contents from the sale of ciprofloxacin with aventis  the contractual successor to our partner in the cipro patent challenge case 
bayer s period of pediatric exclusivity expired on june  and  as we expected  several other competing ciprofloxacin products were launched 
tamoxifen for most of the first six months of fiscal we sold a distributed version of tamoxifen that we purchased from astrazeneca under the terms of a supply and distribution agreement entered into as part of a patent challenge settlement 
this agreement ended in december we began selling our manufactured tamoxifen product when astrazeneca s pediatric exclusivity for nolvadex ended on february  therefore  we recorded no sales from a distributed version of tamoxifen in fiscal oral contraceptives sales of our generic oral contraceptive products increased throughout fiscal and by june  we became the largest supplier of oral contraceptives in the us as determined by prescription market share data provided by ims america 
the revenue growth in fiscal was fueled by increasing volumes resulting from growth in market share by products launched in prior periods and first year sales of new generic oral contraceptives launched during fiscal the largest new product addition was tri sprintec  our generic equivalent to ortho s tri cyclen oral contraceptive 
we launched tri sprintec in december in accordance with the terms of a patent challenge settlement we entered into with ortho 
generic products other sales of other generic products increased approximately in fiscal as compared to the prior year period  primarily due to sales of our mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablet  which we launched in december  and sales of claravis  which we launched in may these increases were partially offset by a significant decline in sales of our dextro salt combo product due to lower pricing and lower volumes resulting from the entry of two additional generic competitors 
proprietary products sales of our proprietary products more than doubled in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
this increase relates primarily to sales from the four products we purchased from wyeth in june  the launch of seasonale  increased sales of cenestin  and sales of loestrin loestrin fe  which we purchased from galen chemicals limited galen in march in september we received approval for seasonale 
we began promoting seasonale directly to physicians in november and initiated our direct to consumer television and print advertising program during our fourth quarter 
demand for the product as measured by prescription data obtained from ims america rose from  per week for the week ended december  to  for the week ended july  sales of cenestin increased at a higher than expected rate of in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to year over year price increases of approximately  the launch of one additional strength and customer buying patterns  which more than offset a decline in cenestin prescriptions 
prescription declines began after the results of the women s health initiative whi study was published in july and continued through fiscal since july  cenestin prescriptions declined at a slower rate than those written for competing conjugated estrogen products  thus allowing us to increase our market share to as of june  compared to as of june  
table of contents cost of sales the following table sets forth cost of sales data in dollars as well as the resulting gross margins  for the two years ended june  and s in millions change generic products gross margin proprietary products gross margin total cost of sales gross margin the increase in total cost of sales  on a dollar basis  for the year ended june   as compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased product sales  principally relating to ciprofloxacin 
margins on our generic products declined slightly in fiscal due mainly to the higher percentage of ciprofloxacin sales in fiscal compared to fiscal as a distributed product that had a profit split paid to our partner  ciprofloxacin had a higher cost of sales and a lower margin than our other products 
margins on our proprietary products declined in fiscal compared to fiscal as increased sales of somewhat lower margin products  including the products acquired from wyeth in late fiscal  more than offset higher sales of cenestin and seasonale 
selling  general and administrative expense the following table sets forth selling  general and administrative expense data for the two years ended june  and s in millions change selling general and administrative charges included in general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  included charges related to strategic acquisitions or other similar activities including a million valuation allowance we established in september for our loans to natural biologics  llc  the raw material supplier for our generic equine based conjugated estrogens product  as the result of an unfavorable court decision rendered in september  the february write off of million associated with the acquisition of certain emergency contraception assets from gynetics  inc  an arbitration panel s decision in june to award solvay pharmaceuticals  inc million in damages on a claim that we improperly terminated an agreement with solvay  and an million charge in june related to costs associated with our settlement of the estrostep and femhrt patent challenge litigation against galen 
included in the year ended june  was a million contingent attorney fee paid in connection with a litigation settlement with wyeth 
the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to increased marketing costs for seasonale of 
table of contents million  higher costs of million associated with the nearly doubling of our women s healthcare sales force  million in higher legal costs  primarily related to patent matters  the solvay arbitration and product liability matters  and million of increased information technology costs  including consulting costs related to the initial phases of designing and implementing our new enterprise resource planning system 
research and development the following table sets forth research and development expenses for the two years ended june  and s in millions change research and development charges included in research and development for the year ended june  our total research and development costs reflected charges relating to strategic acquisitions or similar activities including a write off of million in march resulting from our agreement to acquire schering s rights and obligations under a product development and license agreement that had been capitalized at the time of our acquisition of enhance pharmaceuticals  inc in june  a write off of million for in process research and development acquired in connection with our acquisition of women s capital corporation in february  and the write off of million of in process research and development costs in connection with our purchase of substantially all of the assets of endeavor pharmaceuticals  inc in november included in the year ended june  was a million write off of in process research and development associated with our june purchase from wyeth of four products and the product rights to an oral contraceptive in development 
the remaining increase in research and development for the year ended june  as compared to the prior year was primarily due to million in higher third party development costs  million in higher headcount costs  and million higher raw material costs in support of internal development projects 
income taxes the following table sets forth income tax expense and the resulting effective tax rate stated as a percentage of pre tax income for the years ended june  and s in millions change income tax expense effective tax rate the effective tax rate for fiscal was unfavorably impacted by the write off of in process research and development costs associated with our february acquisition of women s capital corporation  which was not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes 
offsetting the unfavorable impact of the in process research and development costs was a favorable impact of a tax benefit of million related to the completion of several tax audits and the internal revenue service s approval of a change in our method of computing certain tax credits 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview the following table highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources as of june  and s in millions change cash cash equivalents  short term marketable securities working capital cash flow from operations ratio of current assets to current liabilities operating activities our operating cash flows increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our higher operating cash in fiscal was generated principally by our higher net earnings adjusted for non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization  which more than offset increases in certain of our working capital components described below 
our primary source of cash from operations is the collection of accounts and other receivables related to product sales 
our primary uses of cash include financing inventory  research and development programs  marketing and selling  capital projects  our share repurchase program and investing in business development activities 
our cash flows from operations have been more than sufficient to fund our operations  capital expenditures and business development activities 
as a result  our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities balances have increased 
investment in marketable securities during fiscal  we increased our investments in marketable securities to provide a greater return on our cash balances 
our investments in marketable securities are governed by our investment policy which seeks to optimize our returns while preserving our capital  maintaining adequate liquidity and investing in tax advantaged securities  as appropriate 

table of contents working capital working capital as of june  and consisted of the following s in millions change cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories prepaid other current assets total current assets accounts payable accrued liabilities income taxes payable current portion of long term debt capital leases total current liabilities working capital working capital increased in compared to primarily due to an increase in cash and marketable securities resulting from our current period operations 
changes in certain other components of working capital include a decrease in prepaid and other current assets primarily due to a million payment we received from bayer in fiscal related to a price adjustment for ciprofloxacin inventory we purchased during the second half of fiscal and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities largely as a result of the million charge taken in connection with the proposed litigation settlement regarding mircette  partially offset by million in payments made to solvay pharmaceuticals under an arbitration decision rendered against us in fiscal in fiscal holders of warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock exercised the warrants in full through a cashless exercise 
we estimated a total cash tax benefit of approximately million from this exercise 
we have realized a cash tax benefit of approximately million through june  a deferred tax asset of million is expected to reduce income taxes payable over the next years 
investing activities our net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions and a reduction in the net cash used to purchase marketable securities 
capital expenditures during the three fiscal years ended june   we have invested approximately million in upgrades and expansions to our property  plant and equipment as well as technology investments  including the purchase and implementation of a new enterprise resource planning erp system 
the investment in property  plant and equipment has significantly expanded our production  laboratory  warehouse and distribution capacity in our facilities and was designed to help ensure that we have the facilities necessary to manufacture  test  package and distribute our current and future products 
our investment in the erp system will ensure that we have a platform to grow our business  including better integration of acquired businesses  expansion into new drug delivery systems and the ability to expand internationally 

table of contents during the twelve months ended june   we invested million in capital projects and expect that our capital investments will be between million and million over the next twelve months 
our estimate reflects continued spending on our facility expansion programs and investments in information technology projects including the final stages of the implementation of our new erp system 
we believe we can continue funding our capital requirements using cash provided by operations 
however  we may issue long term debt to finance a portion of our projects 
we believe we have the capital structure and cash flow to complete any such financing 
strategic transactions our investment in strategic product and company acquisitions was million in fiscal and approximately million for the three years ended june  in fiscal  these transactions included the buy out of the royalty on seasonale from eastern virginia medical school  and the acquisition of certain product rights from king pharmaceuticals  inc we continuously evaluate strategic transactions to further improve our business and long range prospects and expect to make additional investments or acquisitions over the next twelve months 
we are unable to predict the timing of potential transactions  though the cash required to complete them could equal or exceed the average amounts invested over the past three years 
these transactions typically range from product development and license agreements to asset or corporate acquisitions 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased to million in fiscal from net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal primarily due to funding share repurchases under the our share repurchase program in fiscal and higher debt repayments in fiscal as discussed below 
share repurchase program in august  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock in open market or in privately negotiated transactions  pursuant to terms we deem appropriate and at such times as we designate through the end of december we hold repurchased shares as treasury shares and may use them for general corporate purposes  including but not limited to acquisitions and for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million 
debt repayments and credit availability debt balances decreased by approximately million from june  to june  reflecting principal repayments 
on august   we entered into a new million  five year credit facility 
to date  no draws have been made under the credit facility 
if and when drawn  borrowings will bear interest at a floating rate based on a base rate or a eurodollar rate 
we may use the proceeds of the credit facility for working capital  capital expenditures  and general corporate purposes including share repurchases and permitted acquisitions 
upon entering into the new credit facility  we terminated the million credit facility we had in place at the time 
in february  we made a million payment in complete satisfaction of mortgage notes held by a bank 
the notes were secured by our cincinnati  ohio manufacturing facility 
scheduled principal repayments on existing debt will be million during fiscal proceeds from equity transactions over the three years ending june   we received proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of warrants and employee stock options and share purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
whether we will continue to derive proceeds at a similar level in the future is difficult to predict because the proceeds are highly 
table of contents dependent upon our stock price  which can be volatile  and the type of equity based compensation we may grant in future years 
sufficiency of cash resources we believe our current cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  investment balances  cash flows from operations and un drawn amounts under our revolving credit facility are adequate to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures and to capitalize on strategic opportunities as they arise 
we have and will continue to evaluate our capital structure as part of our goal to promote long term shareholder value 
to the extent that additional capital resources are required  we believe that such capital may be raised by additional bank borrowings or debt offerings or other means 
contractual obligations payments due by period for our contractual obligations at june  are as follows s in millions payments due by period less than to in millions total year to years years thereafter long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations venture funds commitment annual interest on fixed rate debt other long term liabilities total purchase obligations consist mainly of commitments for raw materials used in our manufacturing and research and development operations 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because it is uncertain if and when these milestones will be achieved  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying the accounting policies most critical to our financial statements have a significant impact on our reported results 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and or require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  our most critical policies are the following revenue recognition and related provisions for estimated reductions to gross revenues  inventories and related inventory reserves  income taxes  contingencies  and accounting for acquisitions 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the time the estimates and assumptions were made 
we review the factors that influence our estimates and  if necessary  adjust them 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition and provisions for estimated reductions to gross revenues we recognize revenue from product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred to our customers and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
this is generally at the time products are received by the customer 
from time to time the company provides incentives  such as trade show allowances or stocking allowances  that provide incremental allowances to customers who in turn use such incremental allowances to accelerate distribution to the end customer 
we believe that such incentives are normal and customary in the industry 
additionally  we understand that certain of our wholesale customers anticipate the timing of price increases and have made and may continue to make business decisions to buy additional product in anticipation of future price increases 
this practice has been customary in the industry and would be part of a customer s ordinary course of business inventory level 
we evaluate inventory levels at our wholesale customers  which account for approximately of our sales  through an internal analysis that considers  among other things  wholesaler purchases  wholesaler contract sales  available end consumer prescription information and inventory data from our largest wholesale customer 
we believe that our evaluation of wholesaler inventory levels as described in the preceding sentence  allows us to make reasonable estimates for our applicable reserves 
further  our products are typically sold with sufficient dating to permit sufficient time for our wholesaler customers to sell our products in their inventory through to the end consumer 
upon recognizing revenue from a sale  we simultaneously record estimates for the following items that reduce gross revenues returns and allowances including shelf stock adjustments chargebacks rebates medicaid rebates prompt payment discounts and other allowances for each of the items listed above other than medicaid rebates  the estimated amounts serve to reduce our accounts receivable balance 
we include our estimate for medicaid rebates in accrued liabilities

table of contents returns and allowances our provision for returns and allowances consists of our estimates of future product returns  pricing adjustments  delivery errors  and our estimate of price adjustments arising from shelf stock adjustments which are discussed in greater detail below 
consistent with industry practice  we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period of time both prior and subsequent to the product s expiration date 
the primary factors we consider in estimating our potential product returns include the shelf life or expiration date of each product  historical levels of expired product returns  and the estimated date of return 
shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to our customers to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our products 
these credits are customary in the industry and are intended to reduce a customer s inventory cost to better reflect current market prices 
the determination to grant a shelf stock credit to a customer following a price decrease is at our discretion rather than contractually required 
the primary factors we consider when deciding whether to record a reserve for a shelf stock adjustment include the estimated launch date of a competing product  which we determine based on market intelligence  the estimated decline in the market price of our product  which we determine based on historical experience and input from customers  and  the estimated levels of inventory held by our customers at the time of the anticipated decrease in market price  which we determine based upon historical experience and customer input 
chargebacks we market and sell products directly to wholesalers  distributors  warehousing pharmacy chains  mail order pharmacies and other direct purchasing groups 
we also market products indirectly to independent pharmacies  non warehousing chains  managed care organizations  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
we enter into agreements with some indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products 
these indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices 
alternatively  we may pre authorize wholesalers to offer specified contract pricing to other indirect customers 
under either arrangement  we provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price 
such credit is called a chargeback 
the primary factors we consider in developing and evaluating our provision for chargebacks include the average historical chargeback credits  and an estimate of the inventory held by our wholesalers  based on internal analysis of a wholesaler s historical purchases and contract sales 
rebates our rebate programs can generally be categorized into the following four types direct rebates  indirect rebates  managed care rebates  and medicaid rebates 
the direct and indirect rebates relate primarily to the generic segment of our business whereas our managed care rebates are solely associated with the proprietary segment of our business 
medicaid rebates apply to both of our segments 
direct rebates are generally rebates paid to direct purchasing customers based on a percentage applied to a direct customer s purchases from us 
indirect rebates are rebates paid to indirect customers which have purchased barr products from a wholesaler under a contract with us 
managed care and medicaid rebates are amounts owed based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector medicaid benefit providers  after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
we maintain reserves for our direct rebate programs based on purchases by our direct purchasing customers 
indirect rebate reserves are based on actual contract purchases in a period and an estimate of wholesaler inventory subject to an indirect rebate 
managed care and medicaid reserves are based on expected payments  which are driven by patient usage  contract performance  as well as field inventory that will be subject to a managed care or medicaid rebate 

table of contents prompt pay discounts we offer many of our customers prompt pay discounts 
we evaluate the amounts accrued for prompt pay discounts by analyzing the unpaid invoices in our accounts receivable aging subject to a prompt pay discount 
alliance revenue we have agreements to co promote products developed by other companies 
revenue from the sale of the co promoted product is recorded as alliance revenue and is included in net revenue 
revenue is recognized when the co promotion company ships the product and title and risk of loss pass to a third party 
revenue is primarily based upon a percentage of the co promotion company s net sales or gross margin 
our selling and marketing expenses related to alliance revenue are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and consist of finished goods purchased from third party manufacturers and held for distribution  as well as raw materials  work in process and finished goods manufactured by us 
we determine cost on a first in  first out basis 
we capitalize the costs associated with certain products prior to receiving final marketing approval from the fda for such products pre launch inventories 
for our generic products  each anda submission is made with the expectation that i the fda will approve the marketing of the applicable product  ii we will validate our process for manufacturing the applicable product within the specifications that have been or will be approved by the fda  and iii the cost of the inventory will be recovered from the commercialization of our anda product 
typically  we capitalize inventory related to our proprietary products based on the same expectations as above  but we do not begin to capitalize costs until the nda is filed or in the case of components to a nda product  the product development process has progressed to a point where we have determined that the product has a high probability of regulatory approval 
the accumulation of pre launch inventory involves risks such as i the fda may not approve such product s for marketing on a timely basis  if ever  ii approvals may require additional or different testing and or specifications than what was performed in the manufacture of such pre launch inventory  and iii in those instances where the pre launch inventory is for a product that is subject to litigation  the litigation may not be resolved or settled to our satisfaction 
if any of these risks were to materialize and the launch of such product were significantly delayed  we may have to write off all or a portion of such pre launch inventory and such amounts could be material 
as of june  and  the amount of pre launch inventory was not material to our net earnings 
we establish reserves for our inventory  including pre launch inventory  to reflect situations in which the cost of the inventory is not expected to be recovered 
we review our inventory for products that are close to or have reached their expiration date and therefore are not expected to be sold  for products where market conditions have changed or are expected to change  and for products that are not expected to be saleable based on our quality assurance and control standards 
in addition  for our pre launch inventory  we take into consideration the substance of communications with the fda during the approval process and the views of patent and litigation counsel 
the reserves we establish in these situations is equal to all or a portion of the cost of the inventory based on the specific facts and circumstances 
in evaluating whether inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market  we consider such factors as the amount of product inventory on hand  estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life and current and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
we record provisions for inventory reserves as part of cost of sales 
inventories are presented net of reserves of million at june  and million at june  income taxes our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates and available tax incentives ie credits and planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions may be challenged and may not be upheld on audit 
we adjust our reserves upon the occurrence of a discrete event  such as the completion of an income tax audit 
the effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and charges to reserves that are considered appropriate 
this rate is applied to our quarterly operating results 

table of contents tax regulations require certain items to be included in the income tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the income tax return 
some of the differences are permanent  such as tax exempt interest income  and some are timing differences such as depreciation expense 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return  but have not yet recognized as expense in the financial statements 
contingencies we are involved in various patent  product liability  commercial litigation and claims  government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
we assess  in consultation with counsel  the need to accrue a liability for such contingencies and record a reserve when we determine that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable 
because litigation and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable  our assessment can involve judgments about future events 
we record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when collection is reasonably assured 
we utilize a combination of self insurance and traditional third party insurance policies to cover potential product liability claims on products sold on or after september   and we have obtained extended reporting periods under previous policies for claims arising on products sold prior to september  acquisitions we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition and are not restated 
the cost to acquire a business  including transaction costs  is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business in proportion to their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition 
when we acquire net assets that do not constitute a business  no goodwill is recognized 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our results of operations 
accordingly  for significant items  we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset  which considers various characteristics of the asset  including projected cash flows 
we review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
as a result of our acquisitions  we have recorded goodwill of million on our balance sheets as of june  and in addition  as a result of our acquisition of product rights and related intangibles and certain product licenses  we have recorded million and million as other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  on our balance sheets as of june  and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and amends sfas no 
statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in their income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and directors 
pro forma disclosure is no longer 
table of contents an alternative 
we adopted sfas no 
r on july  this standard requires that compensation expense for most equity based awards be recognized over the requisite service period  usually the vesting period  while compensation expense for liability based awards those usually settled in cash rather than stock be re measured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the award is settled 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation cost for equity based awards 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no net impact on our overall financial position or cash flows 
we use the black scholes formula to estimate the value of stock based compensation granted to employees and directors and expect to continue to use this acceptable option valuation model in the future 
because sfas no 
r must be applied not only to new awards  but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date  compensation cost for some previously granted options will be recognized under sfas no 
r 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that statement would have approximated the impact described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
we will follow the modified prospective method  which requires us to record compensation expense for the non vested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding at the initial date of adoption and to record compensation expense for any awards issued or modified after july  based on the adoption of the modified prospective method  we expect to record pre tax stock based compensation expense of approximately million in fiscal this amount represents awards granted in prior years which are vesting in fiscal and fiscal year awards expected to be granted 
in november  the fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage 
arb no 
allowed some of these abnormal costs to be carried as inventory whereas sfas no 
requires that these costs be recognized in income as incurred 
this statement is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning july  we have evaluated the effect of adopting sfas no 
and have determined that this statement will not have a significant effect on our current consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the act  to provide accounting guidance on the appropriate treatment of tax benefits generated by the enactment of the act 
the fsp requires that the manufacturer s deduction be treated as a special deduction in accordance with sfas no 
and not as a tax rate reduction 
we assessed the impact of adopting fsp fas on our consolidated financial statements and expect to realize a slight reduction in our effective tax rate during fiscal the act will be effective for our fiscal year beginning july  environmental matters we may have obligations for environmental safety and clean up under various state  local and federal laws  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  commonly known as superfund 
based on information currently available  environmental expenditures have not had  and are not anticipated to have  any material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation  seasonality inflation has had only a minimal impact on our operations in recent years 
similarly  our business is generally not affected by seasonality

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of approximately million 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
our investment portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents and market auction debt securities primarily classified as available for sale 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio in a variety of high credit quality debt securities  including us  state and local government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
over of our portfolio matures in less than three months  or is subject to an interest rate reset date that occurs within days 
the carrying value of the investment portfolio approximates the market value at june  and the value at maturity 
because our investments consist of cash equivalents and market auction debt securities  a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
none of our outstanding debt at june  bears interest at a variable rate 
any borrowings under our million unsecured revolving credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on the prime rate  the federal funds rate or libor 
at june   no amounts were drawn under this facility
