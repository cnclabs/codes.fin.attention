table of contents off balance sheet arrangements the company is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on the company s financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  reserves relating to workers compensation  general and auto insurance liabilities  reserves for inventory markdowns  calculation of asset impairment  shrink accrual and tax contingency reserves 
the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed with the audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on estimates of actual write offs and the accounts receivable aging roll rates over a period of up to months 
the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and adjusted  as necessary  on a monthly basis 
the company also provides for estimated uncollectible late fees charged based on historical write offs 
the company s financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in bad debt write off experience and the aging of the accounts receivable portfolio 
insurance liabilities the company is primarily self insured for health care  property loss  workers compensation and general liability costs 
these costs are significant primarily due to the large number of the company s retail locations and employees 
the company s self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported  less amounts paid against such claims  and are not discounted 
management reviews current and historical claims data in developing its estimates 
the company also uses information provided by outside actuaries with respect to workers compensation and general liability claims 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical experience upon which insurance provisions are recorded is not indicative of future trends  then the company may be required to make adjustments to the provision for insurance costs that could be material to the company s reported financial condition and results of operations 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from estimates 
revenue recognition while the company s recognition of revenue is predominantly derived from routine retail transactions and does not involve significant judgement  revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy of the company 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company recognizes sales at the point of purchase when the customer takes possession of the merchandise and pays for the purchase  generally with cash or credit 
sales from purchases made with cato credit  gift cards and layaway sales are also recorded when the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
gift cards  layaway deposits and merchandise credits granted to customers are recorded as deferred revenue until they are redeemed or forfeited 
a provision is made for estimated product returns based on sales volumes and the company s experience  actual returns have not varied materially from amounts provided historically 

table of contents credit revenue on the company s private label credit card portfolio is recognized as earned under the interest method 
late fees are recognized as earned  less provisions for estimated uncollectible fees 
impairment of long lived assets the company primarily invests in property and equipment in connection with the opening and remodeling of stores and in computer software and hardware 
most of the company s store leases give the company the option to terminate the lease if certain specified sales volumes are not achieved during the first few years of the lease although we have exercised this right infrequently 
the company periodically reviews its store locations and estimates the recoverability of its assets  recording an impairment charge  if necessary  when the company decides to close the store or otherwise determines that future undiscounted cash flows associated with those assets will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value 
this determination is based on a number of factors  including the store s historical operating results and cash flows  estimated future sales growth  real estate development in the area and perceived local market conditions that can be difficult to predict and may be subject to change 
in addition  the company regularly evaluates its computer related and other long lived assets and may accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life if the asset is expected to be replaced or has limited future value 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for that period 
tax reserves the company provides for estimated liabilities for potential income and other tax assessments for which actual settlement may differ materially from amounts provided 
merchandise inventories the company s inventory is valued using the retail method of accounting and is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventory at cost and resulting gross margin are calculated by applying an average cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry 
inherent in the retail method are certain significant estimates including initial merchandise markup  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost and the resulting gross margins 
physical inventories are conducted throughout the year to calculate actual shrinkage and inventory on hand 
estimates based on actual shrinkage results are used to estimate inventory shrinkage  which is accrued for the period between the last inventory and the financial reporting date 
the company continuously reviews its inventory levels to identify slow moving merchandise and uses markdowns to clear slow moving inventory 
the general economic environment for retail apparel sales could result in an increase in the level of markdowns  which would result in lower inventory values and increases to cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in future periods 
management makes estimates regarding markdowns based on inventory levels on hand and customer demand  which may impact inventory valuations 
markdown exposure with respect to inventories on hand is limited due to the fact that seasonal merchandise is not carried forward 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 
lease accounting the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term as defined in sfas no 
our lease agreements generally provide for scheduled rent increases during the lease term or rent holidays  including rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy 
we include any rent escalation and rent holidays in our straight line rent expense 
in addition  we record landlord allowances for normal tenant improvements as deferred rent  which is included in other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
this deferred rent is amortized over the lease term as a reduction of rent expense 
also  leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease term 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s accounting for its leases

in addition  the company maintains million of unsecured revolving credit facilities for short term financing of seasonal cash needs 
the company believes that its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash flows from operations and borrowings available under its revolving credit agreement  will be adequate to fund the company s proposed capital expenditures and other operating requirements over the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond twelve months 
at january   the company had working capital of million compared to million at january  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal is primarily the result of an increase in net income of million  an increase in depreciation expense of million due to store expansion  a reduction in accounts receivable from strong collection efforts of million  a reduction of merchandise inventories of million  a reduction of prepaid expense of million  and an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million
