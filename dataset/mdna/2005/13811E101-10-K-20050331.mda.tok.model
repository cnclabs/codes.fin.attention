actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
we utilize our judgment in various ways including determining whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset  determining the estimated useful lives of assets  and determining if or when an asset has been impaired 
management of the company periodically reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of these assets with their related expected future net cash flows 
should the sum of the related expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value  management will determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized 
an impairment loss would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
to date  management has determined that no impairment of these assets exists 
regulation our business can be materially impacted both positively and negatively by legislative and regulatory changes  such as those previously described 
significant negative changes resulting from these activities could result in an impairment of our property and equipment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
