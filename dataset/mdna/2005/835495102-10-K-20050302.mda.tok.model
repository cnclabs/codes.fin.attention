in off balance sheet arrangements the company had no material off balance sheet arrangements at december  risk management as a result of operating globally  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
the exposure is well diversified as the company s facilities are spread throughout the world  and the company generally sells in the same country where it produces 
the company monitors these exposures and may use traditional currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries  foreign currency assets and liabilities  or forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s foreign operations are exposed to political and cultural risks  but they are not believed to be material because of diversification and the relative stability of most of the countries in which the company has operations 
the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations as a result of using debt as a source of financing its operations 
when necessary  the company expects to use traditional  unleveraged interest rate swaps to manage its mix of fixed and variable rate debt to maintain exposure to interest rate movements within established ranges 
all interest rate swaps qualified as fair value hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  fas and swapped fixed interest rates for floating rates 
during june  the company issued million of notes maturing in and simultaneously entered a million interest rate swap with the same maturity  effectively swapping the fixed rate bond to floating

in accordance with fas  interest expense was lowered by amortization of this gain until the bonds matured on november  the company is a purchaser of commodities such as recovered paper  energy  metal and resin 
the company does not engage in material hedging of many commodities because there is usually a high correlation between the commodity cost and the ultimate selling price of its products 
commodities are generally purchased at market or fixed prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process for quantities expected to be consumed in the ordinary course of business 
on occasion  where the correlation between selling price and commodity price is less direct  the company may enter into commodity futures or swaps to reduce the effect of price fluctuations 
at the end of  the company had commodity swaps outstanding to fix the costs of a portion of raw materials for through in some cases 
the swaps qualify as cash flow hedges under fas the fair market value of these commodity swaps was a favorable position of million million after tax and 
table of contents sonoco products company and consolidated subsidiaries million million after tax at december  and  respectively 
this favorable position is reflected as a component of other assets on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the fair market value of commodity swaps at december  was not material to the consolidated financial statements 
fas requires that derivatives be marked to fair value quarterly and recorded on the balance sheet 
the company uses published market prices or estimated values based on current price quotes and a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair market value of the swaps 
the use of financial instruments to hedge foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price risk was not material to the consolidated financial statements as a whole as of december   or see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on financial instruments 
except for the impact on energy and raw material prices  inflation did not have a material effect on the company s operations in  or the company is subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other matters  wastewater effluent and air emissions 
compliance costs have not been significant due to the nature of the materials and processes used in manufacturing operations 
such laws also make generators of hazardous wastes and their legal successors financially responsible for the cleanup of sites contaminated by those wastes 
the company has been named a potentially responsible party at several environmentally contaminated sites not owned by the company 
these regulatory actions and a small number of private party lawsuits are believed to represent the company s largest potential environmental liabilities

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  including but not limited to those related to inventories  bad debts  derivatives  income taxes  intangible assets  restructuring  pension and other postretirement benefits  environmental liabilities and contingencies and litigation 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates  assumptions and accounting policies are discussed in management s discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where such estimates  assumptions and accounting policies affect the company s reported and expected financial results 

table of contents sonoco products company and consolidated subsidiaries the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates 
revenue recognition in accordance with us gaap  the company records revenue when title and risk of ownership pass to the customer and when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain judgments  such as provisions for estimates of sales returns and allowances  may affect the application of the company s revenue policy and  therefore  the results of operations in its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets the company evaluates its long lived assets property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist or when it commits to sell the asset 
the accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a long lived asset or definite lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value of that asset  an asset impairment charge must be recognized 
the amount of the impairment charge is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  which generally represents the discounted future cash flows from that asset  or in the case of assets the company evaluates for sale  at fair value less costs to sell 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in developing operating cash flow forecasts for the company s discounted cash flow model  including markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce  working capital changes and capital spending requirements 
the company considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its assets are estimated 
however  fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets 
therefore  assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses may affect the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets and possible impairment expense in the company s consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
fas requires that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill step i  an impairment charge for goodwill must be recognized 
the impairment charge is calculated as the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill and its carrying value step ii 
the company s reporting units are the same as its operating segments  as determined in accordance with fas accordingly  these reporting units reflect the way the company manages its business  and impairment testing at this reporting unit level reflects how the company is managed overall 
the components within these reporting units serve similar types of customers  provide similar services and operate in similar regulatory environments 
the benefits of goodwill are shared by each component 
in performing the impairment evaluation required by fas  the company estimates the fair value of each reporting unit and compares it to the carrying amount of that reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of 
table of contents sonoco products company and consolidated subsidiaries a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit  the company is required to perform the second step of the impairment test 
in this step  the company compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
the company uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit 
the company considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its businesses are estimated 
however  fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
therefore  assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses may affect the carrying value and possible impairment expense in the company s consolidated financial statements 
restructuring liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred 
termination costs are recognized upon communication of notice of termination to employees  unless service is required beyond the minimum retention period 
if service is required beyond the minimum retention period  the liability is recognized ratably over the future service period 
if  as a result of the restructuring action  assets become impaired  the assets are written down to the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less estimated costs to sell  if applicable 
the company estimates the fair value of impaired assets using accepted valuation techniques such as available market information or indicative bids  when available 
a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques 
the company considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made  however  the fair values that are ultimately realized upon the sale of the assets to be divested may differ from the estimated fair values reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company records an income tax valuation allowance when the realization of certain deferred tax assets  net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards is not likely 
these deferred tax assets represent expenses recognized for financial reporting purposes  which will result in tax deductions over varying future periods 
certain judgments  assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of the valuation allowance and deferred income tax expense in the company s consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the company periodically reviews assumptions and estimates of the company s probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments

accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
compensation cost for performance stock options is recognized over the vesting period and is recorded based on the quoted market price of the company s stock at the end of the period 
the company records compensation expense associated with performance based stock compensation plans using vesting assumptions that are derived from performance measures as defined in the plans 
in  performance measures consisted of earnings per share and return on net assets employed 
certain judgments  assumptions and estimates in connection with the future achievement of these performance measures may affect the amount of accrued compensation expense and performance based stock compensation expense in the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents sonoco products company and consolidated subsidiaries pension and postretirement benefit plans the company has significant pension and postretirement benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations 
the actuarial valuations employ key assumptions that are particularly important when determining the company s projected liabilities for pension and other postretirement benefits 
key actuarial assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligation  the accumulated benefit obligation  and net periodic benefit cost income for us retirement and retiree health and life insurance plans include a discount rate of to determine benefit obligations  a discount rate of to determine net periodic benefit cost income  an expected long term rate of return of and a rate of compensation increase of 
these assumptions are as of december  the company adjusts its discount rate annually in relationship to movements in high quality debt instruments 
the long term rate of return assumption is based on the company s historical plan return performance 
the rate of compensation assumption is generally based on salary and incentive increases 
a key assumption for the us health and life insurance plan is a medical trend rate beginning at and trending down to an ultimate rate of in the ultimate trend rate of represents the company s best estimate of the long term average annual medical cost increase over the duration of the plan s liabilities
