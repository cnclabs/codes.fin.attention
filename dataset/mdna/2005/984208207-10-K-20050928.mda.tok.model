table of contents overview we provide discount  long distance telecommunication services to more than  recurring residential and small business customers in both canada and the united states  using our facilities based resale model and our voice over internet protocol voip network 
residential marketing efforts are primarily concentrated toward consumers who make significant numbers of international calls  directly targeting ethnic markets and communities in major urban centers 
our customer base is diversified across many ethnic communities which we believe subjects us to a minimal risk of significant rate changes as a result of deregulation or other unforeseen political events in particular countries 
we also offer end to end telecommunications services to small to medium business enterprises in the canadian market 
our focus is to provide the highest quality  competitively priced telecommunications services to existing markets 
we realize that dial around long distance is a commodity and there will be a point in the future when we saturate our own marketplace 
as a result  we intend to leverage the cash flow that this business provides to transition into higher growth  higher margin emerging markets such as voip 
the promotional launch of our voip network has expanded our market by providing cost effective access to global markets 
use of internet protocol enables us to provide yak service to customers who wish to originate or receive calls from multiple international locations and is a natural extension of our traditional value proposition 
we expect that lower costs of providing service should translate into significant savings for a new base of customers with high speed internet connections 
products our primary residential product offering is dial around services also known as casual calling at both variable and flat rate pricing 
casual calling allows our customers to dial around their existing long distance carrier on any call by entering a few digits prior to making the call  without permanently switching long distance carriers 
we offer billing which allows our customers to permanently switch all of their calls from their existing long distance carrier to our long distance service 
we are the largest participant in the canadian dial around market  with over market share 
we believe there is opportunity to further expand the canadian market  and we intend to focus our efforts on retention and growth in this core market 
our goal is to expand the size of the addressable canadian marketplace by marketing our product suite outside of major urban centers 
in november  we began a marketing campaign in the united states to gain share of the billion us dial around market  as estimated by idc 
we promote our dial around services in the united states  relying on our core strategy of niche marketing to ethnic communities to grow market share 
our cic carrier identification code codes  ie  and service are available in states  and we have a targeted marketing campaign in south florida  new york and los angeles 
we have entered into agreements with celebrity ethnic spokespersons  specialized internet marketing organizations and utilized print and outdoor media to further market and expand our us operations 
our strategic focus in the us is supported by our office in aventura  florida 
although the us market is highly competitive  our marketing campaign has yielded positive results during the year ended june   with monthly minutes growing approximately from approximately million in june to approximately million in june although this market is intensely competitive  we believe that through the implementation of a strategically focused approach  there exists an opportunity to grow this market 
in november  we introduced a dial around service in peru 
although peru represented a very small portion of our total business  this introduction provided us with an opportunity to develop competitive long distance services and to proactively test the issues relating to voip platform migration internationally 
in march  we decided to exit the peru market as we evaluated our returns from the peruvian joint venture and the potential for significant growth versus that available in other markets 
operations in peru are expected to be fully wound down by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents yak for business  our division targeting the canadian small to medium enterprise sme market  provides competitively priced voice and data products  including local lines  long distance  data management and point to point private lines 
in the near future  we also intend to introduce a broadband offering to the sme market 
additionally  we offer telecom management services to the mid to large sized customer base in canada through our subsidiary contour telecom 
in march  we purchased the ontario and quebec local resale customer base and centrex lines of navigata communications ltd  a member of the saskatchewan telecommunications sasktel group of companies for  as a result of this transaction  we acquired a customer base of approximately sme customers  totaling approximately  centrex lines on which resale services are provided 
we plan to integrate the acquired customers and lines into our yak for business division 
we also provide long distance alternative services to the rapidly growing cellular telephone consumer market 
through a two stage dialing process  the cellular telephone user in both canada and the united states can access domestic and international long distance services at rates favorable to those charged by their incumbent cellular service provider 
in january  we began marketing our voip service  worldcity voip  to residential customers in canada and the us for customers who currently have high speed internet access  worldcity voip includes free member to member international calling and combines bundled local and long distance calling packages with very competitive international rates  plus enhanced calling features like caller id  three way calling and voicemail for one flat price 
in addition to the basic package  future releases of the product are expected to provide services such as unified messaging and virtual international phone numbers  where available 
our voip service is generally available everywhere and specific did direct dial numbers are currently available in us cities  canadian cities and london  england for incoming calling 
to advance both the quality and quantity of our voip services  we have engaged the services of kayote networks  inc and xten networks  inc kayote networks provides recognized industry expertise to help define voip technology solutions that break through the typical interoperability issues that have heretofore inhibited the widespread acceptance of internet based services 
xten provides end user devices that offer consumers choice in how they initiate voip calls 
xten provides soft phone capability that allows customers to make and receive phone calls or video phone calls directly on their personal computer without the need of a regular analogue phone line 
networks over the past four years  we have established and expanded our own private leased line network throughout all major canadian provinces 
additionally  we have achieved comparable network breadth in the us by interconnecting with a major us carrier 
currently  this coast to coast network delivers all of our telephony traffic 
to further enhance the cost and control advantages of this network  in september  we purchased a tekelec santera switch and media gateway 
the port density and significantly reduced foot print of this switch has enabled us to transition our traffic from our legacy teltronics harris switches  resulting in significant cost savings 
the harris switches have now been decommissioned 
our current level of traffic is using approximately  ports and our santera switch is expandable to  ports 
as a result  we anticipate having significant switching capacity in the foreseeable future 
costs in addition to the direct cost savings associated with the transition to and operation of the santera platform  the transition has also afforded us the opportunity to reduce costs by bringing a greater portion of our traffic onto our own network 
also  we continually pursue other methods of reducing our variable direct costs such as employing least cost routing of our international traffic  negotiating lower variable costs with multiple carriers to multiple destinations in order to achieve the lowest available cost per minute  and continuing to expand the capacity of our network to accommodate the growing demand in certain areas of the markets we serve 

table of contents voip we believe that internet enabled voice services represent an important emerging market opportunity in the communications industry 
the service enables voice communication over broadband ip networks  significantly reducing costs to end users while bundling a broad array of value added services  eg  voicemail  call waiting  caller id  call forwarding  auto attendant  find me follow me and roaming 
we believe we are well positioned to capture market share as voip services gain popularity among traditional phone users 
we have initiated strong relationships with technology and network providers to incorporate voice over high speed internet into our current offering 
in january  we commenced a marketing campaign to support our voip product launch 
we intend to leverage our successful dial around business model which concentrates in the ethnic communities for international calling  the market reach of current advertising  and the ability to carry a portion or all of a call over the internet  to maximize our voip initiative gross margin potential 
foreign currency currently  of our net revenue is derived from sales and operations in canada 
the functional currency for this revenue is the canadian dollar 
our reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar 
although we expect to derive less of our total business directly from canada in the future  exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant  and potentially adverse  effect on our results of operations 
strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar could have a positive impact on our future results of operations 
significant transactions  subsequent events and financial restatements on january   we engaged deloitte touche deloitte as our new independent certified public accountants 
in connection with their review of the historical financial statements  deloitte identified a software acquisition transaction with respect to which the accounting treatment we used was possibly incorrect 
on february   we announced that we would be delaying the filing of our form q for the third fiscal quarter ended december   beyond the extended filing deadline of february   because the work required to review this matter was not able to be completed 
also on february   the nasdaq stock market advised us that we did not comply with marketplace rule c  which requires yak to provide nasdaq with copies of all reports required to be filed with the us securities and exchange commission sec 
as a result  nasdaq appended the fifth character e to our common stock trading symbol as of the opening of business on february  on march   we entered into a settlement agreement with consortio inc and convenxia limited  the sellers of the next generation software 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  yak paid  to the sellers and committed to complete further development of the software for  in exchange for a discharge of any further obligation under a long term promissory note with a principal value of million as of december  for further details  see note to our consolidated financial statements next generation software and financial restatements 
during the period of february  to march   deloitte was unable to reconcile the substance and form of the software acquisition transaction to determine a preferred accounting treatment 
on march   deloitte resigned as our independent certified public accountants 
on march   we sought guidance from the office of the chief accountant oca of the sec with respect to the accounting issues arising from the subject software acquisition transaction described above 
due to the judgments involved in the applicable accounting analysis  yak  in consultation with its audit committee  decided to obtain the guidance of the oca for its analysis and conclusions regarding the subject software transaction 

table of contents on april   we re engaged horwath orenstein llp as our new independent certified public accountants 
as a result of continuing discussions with the oca staff  along with an internal review by our management  the audit committee and our independent auditors  we determined in may to correct accounting errors related to the june software transaction 
these corrections required that certain previously filed periodic reports be amended to include restated financial statements  including our consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and  along with the quarterly periods contained in fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal as a result  we restated our consolidated financial statements to make the following classes of adjustments the restatement changes in accounting treatment of software acquisition transaction correct balance sheet amounts to reflect adjustments resulting from change in accounting treatment adjust consolidated statement of operations and statement of cash flows for interest expense  depreciation expense  other income  and related income tax expense to reflect changes in the above referenced accounting treatment on may   we filed amendments to certain of our previously filed periodic reports to include the foregoing changes in our restated financial statements  as well as in our delinquent form qs for the fiscal quarters ended december  and march  on june   nasdaq provided us with formal notice that we were in compliance with the decision of a nasdaq listing qualification panel regarding the listing of our common stock and that our common stock would continue to be listed under the symbol yakc 
subsequent to the may  amended filings  and in conjunction with its continued discussions with the oca staff  we discovered certain additional errors in our amended filings 
on september   our board of directors approved management s recommendation to correct our accounting related to the software acquisition transaction  to correct the following an error in calculating the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the transaction components for the may  restatements 
the error caused the company to overstate the value of a long term note payable  joint venture receivable and the subject software in its amended annual report on form k a for fiscal year and subsequent periodic filings 
the revaluation of the long term note payable in the amended annual report on form k a for the fiscal year ended june  was not consistent with gaap  notwithstanding the fact that the resultant gain was deferred 
the loss on impairment of the joint venture receivable was incorrectly deferred in the amended annual report on form k a for fiscal year the loss should have been recognized in the fourth fiscal quarter of the million gain recognized on early extinguishment of debt in the third fiscal quarter of was overstated by million 
the foregoing changes have been incorporated into this annual report on form k to correct our financial statements for fiscal years and  respectively  as well as each of the quarters in fiscal years and except the fourth quarter to reflect the fair value of certain software acquired by us on june   and to revise the respective balance sheets accordingly 
all applicable amounts relating to these restatements have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this form k

also in march  we decided to exit the peru market as we re evaluated the economic returns of our peruvian joint venture and potential for significant growth as compared to that available in other international markets 
operations in peru are expected to be fully wound down by the end of the first fiscal quarter of use of non gaap financial measures we use pro forma information regarding certain non recurring costs and cost of revenue in our md a 
these are non gaap financial measures 
we use and present non gaap financial measures along with gaap results to evaluate and communicate the performance of the company 
management believes that these non gaap financial measures provide useful information to investors and contribute to an understanding of our financial performance 
in particular  management believes that these non gaap financial measures allow investors to monitor and evaluate our ongoing operating results and trends and gain a better understanding of our past performance as well as period to period performance 
these measures should not  however  be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

table of contents pro forma information as a result of several unrelated matters  we have incurred several one time costs that have had a significant impact on the current period s earnings 
they include the following items impact of significant expenses impact on net earnings million usd impact on eps net earnings eps as reported estimated impact of one time events tax affected costs associated yak peru dwsa due diligence costs proposed acquisitions sec restatement costs recruiting fees for management total adjusted net earnings critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
this listing of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap  with no need for management s judgment regarding accounting policy 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity revenue recognition while our revenue recognition policy does not require the exercise of significant judgment or the use of significant estimates  we believe that our policy is significant as revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we recognize revenue for dial around services and the resale of long distance services at the time of customer usage based upon minutes of use revenue from the resale of voice and data telecommunications services to business enterprises at the time of customer usage based upon amounts billed by the respective service providers revenue related to administrative services on a straight line basis over the term of related contracts unearned revenue for amounts billed in accordance with customer contracts but no yet earned revenue for amounts earned but not yet invoiced 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts as of june   we had million of gross trade accounts receivable with a recorded allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis  using historical collection trends  analyses of receivable portfolios by business unit and by reviewing specific accounts and make adjustments in the allowance as necessary 
changes in economic conditions or dramatic changes in the telecommunications industry could have an impact on the collection of receivable balances or future allowance considerations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
we have generated deferred income tax liabilities primarily due to the accounting basis of our assets exceeding the tax basis of those same assets 
these liabilities are offset by certain net operating loss carryforwards that are available for twenty years from the date incurred and which begin to expire in the year our ability to fully utilize these net operating loss carryforwards is highly dependent on our ability to generate future income in the tax jurisdictions that the losses originated 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we will be required to adjust our deferred tax valuation allowances 
our income tax accounts reflect estimates of the outcome or settlement of various asserted and unasserted income tax contingencies including tax audits and administrative appeals 
at any point in time  several tax years may be in various stages of audit or appeals or could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
this requires a periodic identification and evaluation of significant doubtful or controversial issues  both individually and in the aggregate 
the results of these audits  appeals  or expiration of the statute of limitations could affect our prior estimates for income tax accounts 
the effective income tax rate in any period may be materially impacted by the overall level of income loss before income taxes  the jurisdictional mix and magnitude of income loss  changes in the income tax laws which may be retroactive  changes in the expected outcome or settlement of an income tax contingency  changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance  and adjustments of a deferred tax asset or liability for enacted changes in tax laws or rates 
customer lists as of june   customer lists were recorded at a net book value of million  representing the unamortized cost of customer lists purchased as part of the argos now yak for business and contour acquisitions in july as well as the customer base purchased from navigata communications ltd 
in march  as discussed above 
customer lists are amortized on a straight line basis over five years  which represents the estimated customer life cycle in the telecom industry 
if the retention rate for acquired customers is less than initially estimated  accelerated amortization or impairment may be necessary 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill as of june   our long lived assets were comprised primarily of million of property and equipment and million of goodwill 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets and goodwill according to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
our estimate of useful lives on property and equipment are based on assumptions using historical data and industry trends 
impairment is recorded on long lived assets when assets are identified for disposal and if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows 
impairment is recorded on goodwill when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of that reporting unit 

table of contents the determination and measurement of an impaired loss requires the continuous use of significant judgments and estimates 
our assumptions related to estimates of future cash flows are based on historical results of cash flows adjusted for management projections for future periods taking into account known conditions and planned future activities 
our assumptions regarding the fair value of our long lived assets and goodwill are based on the discounted future cash flows 
future events may result in differences in management s judgments and estimates 
factors that could result in increased future impairment charges include increases in interest rates  which would impact discount rates  unfavorable economic conditions or other factors  such as a change in our expectations for growth and public acceptance of ip telephony technology  which could decrease revenues and profitability  and changes in our cost structure 
estimating fair value we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities associated with the purchase of certain next generation telecommunications software from consortio  inc and convenxia limited noted above  based on the related estimated cash flows 
statement of financial accounting concepts no 
sfac no 
provides a framework for using future cash flows and present value as the basis for accounting measurements of fair value 
when observable marketplace determined values are not available  discounted cash flows are often used to estimate fair value 
consistent with the methodology of sfac no 
 we used the expected cash flow approach to estimate fair value  focusing on explicit assumptions about the range of possible cash outcomes and their respective probabilities 
stock based compensation statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  defines fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans and transaction in which an entity issued its equity instruments to acquire goods or services from non employees  and encourages but does not require companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
we have chosen to account for employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting form stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  employee compensation cost for stock is measured as the excess  if any  of the estimated fair value of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r share based payment  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb  and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for and recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair value 
sfas no 
r will be effective for public companies that do not file as small business issuers as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  management is evaluating the provisions of this standard 
depending upon the number and terms of options that may be granted in future periods  the implementation of this standard could have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations

the balance of the increase was predominantly due to our product which added revenues of million for the period ended june   which were partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our looneycall product of million 
we achieved significant growth in the u 
s market during this fiscal year  with revenue in our us operating territories increasing by million 
this was achieved by successfully implementing our plan in the u 
s  which included actions such as completion of the loading of our cic access codes in the mainland states launch of our product in the fall of targeted marketing campaigns using a variety of media including  the internet  newspaper advertisements  flyers and commercials featuring various spokespeople

contour telecom contributed revenue of approximately for the fiscal year ended june  which represented a decrease of million from the comparable period in when unadjusted for the foreign exchange rate 
for information regarding foreign currency risk  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below 
the average rate per minute arpm we derive from our core dial around services was for the period ending june  as compared to for the period ended june  due to the competitive nature of the business and the fact that long distance services are a commodity product  we expect continual  gradual erosion in the arpm in the coming years 
see the discussion in direct costs below regarding the actions we are taking to control costs and maintain margins 
direct costs cost of revenue increased million or  to million for the fiscal year ended june   from million for the fiscal year ended june  the overall cost of revenue decreased to of sales for the fiscal year ended june   from of sales for the fiscal year ended june  margins improved primarily as a result of the increased utilization of our leased line network 
we continue to build out our canadian network  which enables us to bring a greater share of traffic onto our own network  resulting in a higher utilization of fixed cost access lines 
as a result of the continued downward pressure on the price of long distance telephony  we are utilizing real time  least cost routing algorithms and contracting with various carriers to efficiently and effectively manage direct costs

cost of revenue in our dial around business is comprised primarily of the cost of long distance services  fees for the processing and transporting of our calls and fixed and variable line access costs 
the cost of the pure long distance component of services has decreased to million or for the fiscal year ended june   from million or for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in the relative percentage of revenue is a result of actively seeking competitive routes and the effect of deregulation on the cost of long distance in other international markets 
the cost of the other fees component of services see list above has increased to for the fiscal year ended june   from for the fiscal year ended june  the majority of this increase is due to call processing fees and switch costs

the largest component of the increase in g a was salaries 
this is a result of hiring additional senior management including several executives with extensive telecommunications experience and customer service representatives to facilitate the future growth of our business 
additionally  as we move into new markets and introduce new products  we have invested in our front line customer support organization 
we believe that customer service has been a key differentiating factor for us and we expect that this will continue in the future 
legal and consulting expenses increased million or to million for fiscal year ended june  the increase in expense is primarily a result of tax compliance and other legal matters related to the introduction of our products into the us market  costs incurred due to the accounting restatement with respect to a historical software transaction  fees incurred for sarbanes oxley compliance  as well as fees in connection with regulatory matters and the fees associated with due diligence efforts associated with certain acquisition opportunities

sales marketing overall  sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june   from million for the fiscal year ended june  however  in our canadian territory  the cost of advertising decreased by million to million for the fiscal year ended june   primarily due to decreased direct mail and promotional activities for our dial around product in ontario and cost reductions resulting from a switch in advertising agencies 
advertisement spending of million in our us markets began in the current calendar year 
upon entering the us market  we invested advertising dollars in certain specific metropolitan areas in order to increase our brand awareness 
the significant increase in the amount of advertising in the us market was to support the launch of our dial around and service through a focused campaign of flyers  tv commercials and internet based advertising 
interest on note payable on june   we purchased certain next generation telecommunications software from an unrelated third party for million

financing accounts receivable financing costs relating to the factoring of our trade accounts receivable decreased to million for the fiscal year ended june   compared with million for the fiscal year ended june  given the amount of cash on hand  it was determined that financing our receivables was not necessary  and therefore  we fully paid down our factoring facility in march organizational startup costs organizational and start up costs for the continued development of our voip initiative were million for the year ended june  these costs were composed primarily of employee related expenses million  occupancy and office related expenses million  and legal fees million 
the voip product was announced on september   and as we continue to further develop the product we anticipate there will be further organizational and startup costs related to this business 
depreciation amortization depreciation and amortization remained flat at million for the fiscal year ended june  when compared to the fiscal year ended june  this was due to minimal new capital expenditures and the continued amortization of the property and equipment that have been capitalized on the balance sheet

as a result of the continual downward pressure on the price of long distance  our company is actively employing real time least cost routing algorithms and contracting with various carriers in order to manage the direct costs as efficiently as possible 
in addition  to further control costs  we have continued to build out our network  which enables us to bring a greater share of our traffic onto our own network  resulting in a higher utilization of our fixed cost access lines 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million or to million for the fiscal year ended june   from million for the fiscal year ended june  the cost of advertising and promotion increased million to million for the fiscal year ended june  in our canadian territory  primarily due to increased direct mail and promotional activities for our dial around product in ontario  to support the introduction to the east coast and to grow the business in the rest of country 
spending for advertising in our us territory decreased by million to million for the fiscal year ended june   from million for the fiscal year ended june  upon entering the us market in  we invested advertising dollars in specific metropolitan areas in order to increase our brand awareness 
the operating model that we employed in canada was not as suitable in the more complex us market and management decided to retrench in the us market and reduced expenditures until our cic access codes were fully loaded and tested in all states and we had re strategized our marketing initiatives 
it is management s intention to significantly increase the amount of advertising in the us market to support the launch of our service in the first quarter of  through a focused campaign of flyers  tv commercials and internet based advertising 
general and administrative expenses g a increased million or  to million for the fiscal year ended june   from million for the fiscal year ended june  of this increase  million can be attributed directly to our acquisition of contour and argos 
the remaining increase of g a of million can be attributed mainly to increases of salaries million  legal and audit million  occupancy million and consulting services million 
the largest component of the increase in g a was salaries  a result of hiring additional administration  technical and customer service employees that were required to support our growth during fiscal year  and support the launch of our voip product in the first quarter of fiscal it is anticipated that salaries will continue to increase in our broadband division as we add employees in the technical and customer service areas  proportionate to the growth of that business 
in addition  to facilitate our future growth  we added five executives with extensive telecommunications experience to the management team which increased salaries by million for the period ended june  legal and audit expenses increased million or to million for fiscal year ended june  the majority of the increase was in professional fees including regulatory matters  support of our voip development  in addition to the costs associated with exploring the company s new growth opportunities and 
table of contents financing alternatives 
in addition  the company incurred costs of approximately million related to due diligence costs of an acquisition that was eventually abandoned 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  this increase resulted primarily from an increase in capital spending and a reduction in the estimated useful life of existing telecommunication switching systems  the latter of which amounted to million in increased depreciation 
the accelerated write down of the switching systems is based on a conservative view of their remaining useful lives 
amortization of customer lists for the period was liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements arise from cash used in operating activities  purchases of capital assets and interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness 
to date  we have financed our growth through the private placement of equity securities  borrowings  accounts receivable financing  vendor financing and capital lease financing 
for the fiscal year ended june   there was a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to an increase of million in the prior fiscal year 
net cash provided from operating activities during the fiscal year decreased to million  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  this was primarily due to our pay down of the receivable factoring facility in the approximate amount of million and the decrease in deferred income taxes million from the prior fiscal year 
net cash used in investing activities decreased to million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  for the fiscal year ended june   we used cash for acquisition of property and equipment of million  primarily for our next generation software and broadband equipment 
it is expected that we will continue to add to our network and network equipment in the coming year to support the growth of the business 
in addition  we continue to actively pursue acquisitions that we believe will be accretive in nature to our existing business 
significant commitments that will require the use of cash in future periods include obligations under operating leases  capital leases  advances under contract and other agreements  as shown in the following table in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases telus advances carrier commitments total net cash used by financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to million provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended june  during  million was used to reduce our long term debt owed to long distance carriers  whereas money was previously raised via the issuance of common shares in the third quarter of fiscal we believe we have sufficient fixed network capacity to meet our anticipated volume of telephony traffic in both canada and the us during fiscal based on our current products  we do not anticipate spending additional capital on our canadian switching platform  however  we are currently building an additional switch in the us to provide for long term growth and network redundancy as well as accommodating technological change and operating improvements 

table of contents for the twelve months ended june   yak for business formerly known as argos telecom had revenue of million and  contour telecom had revenue of million 
we expect this amount to be substantially equal for the next months 
having now launched our voip product  we anticipate releasing additional products aimed specifically at the small and medium business customer 
as a result  we would expect top line revenue growth and margin improvement in yak for business in the future 
as a result of the continued convergence of voice and data  the release of our voip product is a significant event because it provides us with a vehicle for future growth 
as high speed internet based services gain a critical level of acceptance in the marketplace  the ability to bundle other services with this core offering will become an important distinguishing factor between the many competitors 
we plan to continue to research and augment our core offerings with value added services that are priced competitively and address the demands of the market 
in addition to our voip product  we have introduced a new product in the us market 
the introduction of this new product is consistent with our previously stated intentions of increasing our presence in the us market 
through new product introductions and potentially new acquisitions  we anticipate growing our customer base in the us market substantially over the medium to long term 
we believe that our current operations will be able to continue to generate sufficient cash to meet our current obligations and support the growth of our business through new product introductions  eg  voip and the launch of our product in the us market 
we may seek to obtain additional funds from public or private equity or debt offerings to fund new opportunities that may arise

industry trends and specific risks may affect our future business and results 
the matters discussed below could cause our future results to differ from past results or those described in forward looking statements and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and stock price 

table of contents our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers 
our success will depend on our ability to effectively anticipate and adapt to customer requirements and offer products and services that meet customer demands 
any failure of our current or prospective customers to purchase products from us for any reason  including a downturn in their economic fortunes  would seriously harm our ability to grow our business 
increasingly  our growth will depend on our ability to successfully fund and develop and introduce new and enhanced products 
the development of new or enhanced products is a costly  complex and uncertain process that requires us to anticipate accurately future technological and market trends 
we cannot be sure whether our new product offerings will be successfully developed and introduced to the market on a timely basis  or at all 
if we do not develop these products in a timely manner  our competitive position and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  as we introduce new or enhanced products  we must also manage the transition from older products to newer products 
if we fail to do so  we may disrupt customer ordering patterns or may not be able to ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet anticipated customer demand 
any failure to effectively manage this transition may cause us to lose current and prospective customers 
our business is dependent upon our ability to keep pace with the latest technological changes 
the international telecommunications industry is changing rapidly due to deregulation  technological improvements  and expansion of telecommunications infrastructure  privatization and the globalization of national economies 
there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not vary in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  deregulation of any particular market may cause such market to shift unpredictably 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or adjust our contemplated plan of development to meet changing market conditions 
the market for our services and the telecommunications industry generally is in a period of rapid technological evolution  marked by the introduction of new product and service offerings and increasing transmission capacity for services similar to those provided by us 
failure to respond in a timely and cost effective way to these technological developments could result in serious harm to our business and operating results 
we have derived  and we expect to continue to derive  a substantial portion of our revenues from providing telecommunications services that are based upon current technologies which are capable of adapting to future technologies 
as a result  our success will depend  in part  on our ability to afford the cost of acquiring new hardware and software associated with new technologies  develop and market service offerings that have significant customer demand  respond in a timely manner to the technological advances of our customers  evolving industry standards and changing client preferences 
our profitability will depend on our ability to offer  on a timely and cost effective basis  services that meet evolving industry standards 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to access or adapt to such technological changes at a competitive price  maintain competitive services or obtain new technologies on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms 
the increase of services offered by our competitors could adversely impact our business 
recently  telecommunications providers have increased the range of telecommunication services they offer to customers 
this activity and the potential continuing trend towards offering new services may lead to a greater ability among our competitors to provide a comprehensive range of telecommunications services  which could lead to a reduction in demand for our services 
moreover  by offering certain services to end users  competitors could reduce the number of our current or potential customers and increase the bargaining power of our remaining customers  which may adversely impact our business 

table of contents our business is susceptible to severe pricing pressures from the larger carriers 
the long distance telecommunications industry is significantly impacted by the marketing campaigns and associated pricing decisions of the larger carriers 
there has been downward pressure on prices in the industry in recent years  a trend that we expect to continue 
our competitors within the canadian market include bce  telus  and allstream 
more recently  canada s large cable operators have launched or are expected to launch bundled voip long distance services 
additionally  as we launch our products into the us market  our competitors will expand dramatically and will likely include at t  mci  sprint  the rbocs  and the major wireless carriers 
the recent acquisition of at t corp 
by sbc communications  and verizon communications inc s purchase of mci inc 
may further intensify competitive pressures in the us long distance market 
we would also expect that the competition will be intense in certain emerging markets including those associated with our voip product 
many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources  larger networks  a broader portfolio of service offerings  greater control over transmission lines  stronger name recognition and customer loyalty  and long standing relationships with our target customers 
as a result  our ability to attract and retain customers particularly in the united states may be adversely affected 
the success of our broadband initiative is dependent on growth and public acceptance of ip telephony as well as our ability to adapt to rapid technological changes in ip telephony 
the development of broadband telephony in canada and the united states is in its nascent stages 
it is uncertain as to how competition in our markets for telephony opportunities provided by broadband applications will develop 
the financial models for return on pricing  capital expenditures and return on investment have not been fully developed so it is difficult to gauge what applications will be financially successful 
the success of our broadband initiative is dependent upon future demand for ip telephony systems and services which  in turn  will depend on a number of factors including ip telephony achieving a similar level of reliability that users of the public switched telephone network have come to expect from their telephone service 
ip telephony service providers must offer cost and feature benefits to their customers that are sufficient to cause the customers to switch away from traditional telephony service providers 
if any or all of these factors fail to occur  our broadband business may not grow 
our services are subject to various types of governmental regulation 
while our retail services have been largely deregulated by the crtc  any change in crtc policy  regulations or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on yak s operations and financial condition and operating results 
although we currently comply with the crtc s obligations to provide basic services  the crtc indicated that this is only an interim measure and expects voip providers to offer full enhanced services 
we may not have the capability to offer enhanced services as required by the crtc 
we do not currently offer any services in the united states  and may not be able to provide e services  as required by the fcc order  by the fcc s november  deadline 
compliance with the fcc order will require us to negotiate and secure expensive routing arrangements with traditional local exchange carriers and public safety answering points throughout the united states 
we may also seek to engage a third party provider of e services for compliance purposes but no third party provider currently offers a comprehensive nationwide solution 
if we are not able to implement a comprehensive e solution by the november  deadline  we may be compelled to modify our existing offerings  seek an extension or waiver of the fcc requirements  cease providing voip service  or be in material violation of the fcc rules and  as a result  at risk for substantial enforcement penalties 
further  if the fcc were to determine that those voip service providers like yak  or the services they provide  are subject to fcc regulation  including the payment of access charges and contribution to the universal service funds  it could have a material adverse affect on our broadband initiative 
in addition  although the fcc has declared that certain voip services are interstate in nature and therefore subject to federal regulation  state regulatory 
table of contents authorities potentially still retain some oversight of may determine thatintrastate ip telephony service and could impose some regulatory burdens on voip providers 
should be subject to local regulation  certification and fees 
further  although other aspects of the regulatory status of voip telephony remain undecided at the fcc  the fcc and other us regulatory bodies have begun to assert regulatory authority and impose obligations on voip telephony providers 
the effect of potential future voip telephony laws and regulations on our broadband initiative in the united states cannot yet be determined 
additionally  our ability to offer voip services outside north america is subject to the local regulatory environment  which may be unknown  complicated and often uncertain 
regulatory treatment of voip telephony outside north america varies from country to country 
there is no assurance that we will immediately be in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations of the markets we have identified as promising for our voip services 
some countries may assert that we are required to register as a telecommunications any future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results 
we may expand our operations through acquisitions over time 
this may require significant management time and financial resources because we may need to integrate widely dispersed operations with distinct corporate cultures 
our failure to manage future acquisitions successfully could seriously harm our operating results 
also  acquisition costs could cause our quarterly operating results to vary significantly 
furthermore  our stockholders would be diluted if we financed the acquisitions by incurring convertible debt or issuing securities 
the current expansion of the company will continue to put pressure on management 
our continued growth and expansion may place a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources  and increase demand on our systems and controls 
we entered the sme market in july  launched our voip service in september and expanded into the us market in the fall of to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to implement and improve our operational and financial systems and controls  purchase and utilize other transmission facilities  and expand  train and manage our employee base 
if we inaccurately forecast the movement of traffic onto our network  we could have insufficient or excessive transmission facilities and disproportionate fixed expenses 
as we proceed with our development  operational difficulties could arise from additional demand placed on customer support  billing and management information systems  on our support  sales and marketing and administrative resources and on our network infrastructure 
we have a significant dependence on transmission facilities based carriers 
we primarily connect our customers telephone calls through transmission lines that we lease under a variety of arrangements with other facilities based long distance carriers 
many of these carriers are  or may become  our competitors 
our ability to maintain and expand our business depends on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with the facilities based carriers from which we lease transmission lines 
where competition in the underlying access facilities does not exist  regulators mandate non discriminatory access to such facilities 
if our relationship with one or more of these carriers were to deteriorate or terminate  it could have a material adverse effect upon our cost structure  service quality  network diversity  results of operations and financial condition 
similarly  if regulators should prematurely deregulate this market  it could have a similar material adverse effect 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and other trading market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest all appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

table of contents if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  areas of our internal controls that need improvement 
as discussed in item a 
controls and procedures  we are continuing to work to improve our internal controls 
we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
our quarterly results may fluctuate causing our stock price to decline 
a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  are likely to cause these fluctuations 
the factors outside of our control include long distance telecommunications market conditions as well as economic conditions generally  fluctuations in demand for our services  reductions in the prices of services offered by our competitors  costs of integrating technologies or businesses that we add  and changes in foreign exchange rates 
the factors substantially within our control include the timing of expansion into new markets  both domestically and internationally  and the timing and payments associated with possible acquisitions 
because our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  and our common stock could decline significantly which may expose us to risks of securities litigation  impair our ability to attract and retain qualified individuals using equity incentives and make it more difficult to complete acquisitions using equity as consideration 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposures relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign currency in excess of of our current revenue is derived from sales and operations in canada 
the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar 
the functional currency for each of our operating entities is the respective local currency 
in the future we expect to derive a greater proportion of our revenues outside of canada  however  in the short term  changes in the exchange rate may continue to have a significant  and potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused by fluctuations in the us dollar canadian dollar 
we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our canadian subsidiary 
we translate the canadian dollar statements of operations into us dollar using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect our 
table of contents reported profits and losses and cash flows and may distort comparisons from year to year 
as an example  if the us dollar were to strengthen relative to the canadian dollar  it would take a greater amount of revenue and profits in canadian dollars to achieve a similar level of results in us dollars compared to the previous year 
for example  during the year ended june  and  the us dollar weakened compared to the canadian dollar 
as a result  the revenue from our canadian subsidiary increased million or as compared to in in canadian dollars  but increased million or as compared to in when stated in us dollars
