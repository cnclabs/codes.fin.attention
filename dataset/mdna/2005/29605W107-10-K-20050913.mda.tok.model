the variation in any year in the composition of total revenues as between revenues resulting from inventory sales and commissions resulting from consignment sales is largely a function of availability  market demand and conditions 
gross profit gross profit increased approximately  or  to approximately  for the year ended june  from approximately  for the year ended june  the increase in gross profit was the result of an increase in revenue of  coupled with an increase in gross profit percentage from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  the largest contributing factor to the increase in gross profit percentage was  in direct sales to afinsa a related party in the year ended june  under the exclusive supply contracts

r harmer company in july salaries and wages increased  during the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  approximately  of the increase was attributable to the inclusion of a full year s salary expense for the bowers merena  superior sports and nutmeg acquisitions made during the third and fourth quarters of and the hr harmer acquisition in july the remainder of the increase   was attributable to additional personnel and normal salary increases to support additional revenues

the rate is based on a blended rate consisting of us federal  state and foreign statutory income tax rates 
the rates have been reduced by the utilization of a large percentage of the available net operating loss carry forwards for u 
s federal income tax purposes 
future blended tax rates should be higher based on the reduced remaining net operating loss carry forwards 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
our effective tax rate is directly affected by the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are also subject to changing tax laws  regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate 
our effective tax rate can also be influenced by the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and non recurring charges  which may cause fluctuations between reporting periods 
the realization of the company s remaining deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the future to offset the deductibility of temporary differences generating the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize certain deferred tax assets 
in fiscal year  the company recorded a deferred tax asset net of allowance of approximately  due to the gift of a certain art collection  it is expected that the company will be able to utilize this asset over the next five years 
in fiscal year  the company reduced its valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets which were provided for in prior years 
as a result the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of approximately recent new jersey tax legislation provided for the utilization of a portion of net operating losses for fiscal year and thereafter 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company made a charitable contribution of an art collection with a de minimis carrying value that had been held for investment purposes 
the company obtained a qualified appraisal of the collection  which concluded that it had a value of approximately million  resulting in a charitable contribution deduction with a tax benefit of approximately million 
this charitable contribution deduction will be limited to of the company s federal taxable income as computed with certain adjustments each year and will expire in the year to the extent not utilized 
because of the uncertainty of whether future federal taxable income will be sufficient to realize the entire benefit  the company has established a valuation allowance of approximately million 
in addition  although not required to do so  the company has determined to seek additional verification of the value of the collection 
as a result of this or other factors  the tax benefit to the company may be adjusted

exclusive of sales to afinsa  the gross profit percentage increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  the increase  exclusive of sales to afinsa  was the result of higher gross profit margins on auction sales of owned stamp inventory  which reflects an improvement in the quality and pricing of stamp purchases by the company  as well as  to a lesser extent  revenue attributable to the operations of the seven european and four us subsidiaries acquired by the company during the year ended june   this revenue consisted almost entirely of commissions  with respect to which there is no corresponding cost of goods sold

off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangement that has or is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at june   the company s working capital position was approximately  compared to approximately  as of june  the net increase of approximately  was primarily due to increases in cash as a result of strong earnings for the year generating net income of  and improvement in collections of accounts receivables 
in addition  accounts payables decreased by  to  from  operating activities the company experienced a positive cash flow from operating activities of approximately  for the year ended june  as compared to a positive cash flow of approximately  for  an increase of approximately  inventory purchases resulted in a increase in cash flow of in and a decrease of  in the large increase in was primarily due to major purchases of philatelic material to fill the requirements of the exclusive supplier agreement with afinsa related party as well as upcoming philatelic auctions

on september  the company exchanged stock for cash  in one of the three transactions with auctentia see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
borrowings under line of credit agreement with pnc bank see credit and financing facilities  below were  as of june  our future cash flows from the exercise of stock options are difficult to project as such amounts are a function of both our stock price and the decisions by employees to exercise stock options 
in general  we expect proceeds from stock option exercises to increase during periods in which our stock price has increased 
credit and financing facilities the company s credit and financing facilities  which are included in the above discussion  consist of the following during the year ended june   the company obtained a secured loan from a privately held capital fund in the amount of  the loan is collateralized by inventory and bears interest at the rate of per annum 
the loan was due on june  and paid off prior to that date and the facility closed 
on april   the company entered into a revolving credit agreement with banco santander central hispano  sa  providing for a credit facility of up to  borrowings under this facility bore interest at a rate of prime plus 
per annum 
the company s obligations under the agreement were guaranteed by afinsa 
the agreement contained other financial agreements and covenants  including the requirement that auctentia maintain at least of all of the authorized issued and outstanding shares of voting stock of the company 
as extended  the facility expired on april  the loan was repaid prior to the facility s expiration 
on may   the company entered into an agreement with pnc bank for a line of credit not to exceed  the loan is collaterized by accounts receivable  consignor advances and inventory  subject to certain limitations 
borrowings under the line bear interest at the prime rate  provided that the company has the right  subject to certain conditions  to borrow at a rate equal to libor plus per annum 
the agreement contains other financial agreements and covenants 
the credit line  which would otherwise have expired on may   was extended to august  at june   the company had borrowed  under the facility 
subsequent to june   the line was renewed for a two year period expiring on august  and the amount of the facility increased to  on july   one of the minority shareholders of corinphila auktionen made a loan to that company in the aggregate amount of  this loan bears interest at the rate of per annum and is repayable on demand  upon six months notice related party 
at june   the company owed on this facility 
on december   the company obtained a mortgage from pnc bank  na  to finance the purchase of its corporate headquarters 
the mortgage provides for principal payments of with a final payment of due on january  under the financing agreements  the bank may call the mortgage loan at any time  in which case the mortgage loan will be due and payable one year and one day following the exercise of such call option 
further  if the company terminates its line of credit with the bank  the mortgage loan will be payable one year and one day following such termination 
at june   the company owed  on this facility 
the remaining notes payable consist of capital leases and loans payable for the purchase of equipment bearing interest at rates ranging from to 
total borrowings outstanding under the leases were and as of june  and  respectively 
as of june   the company had an aggregate of  of debt outstanding under the above credit and financing facilities 
need for future liquidity the company s need for liquidity and working capital may increase as a result of its continuing business expansion activities 
in addition to the need for such capital to enhance the company s ability to offer cash advances to a larger number of potential consignors of property which is an important aspect of the marketing of an auction business  the company may require additional working capital in the future in order to acquire collectibles for sale in the company s business  to expand into sales of other collectibles and to initiate any other new business activities 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations related to non cancelable operating and capital leases at june  were as follows payment due by period less than to to more than total year years years years notes payable   mortgage   capital lease and other debt obligations operating lease obligations     total      auction cycles a buyer of auctioned property may be permitted to take possession of the property before payment is made 
most accounts receivable are collected within to days  which is consistent with business practice in the collectible markets 
for the year ended june   the company had a bad debt recovery of approximately  and for the year ended june  expense relating to bad debt was approximately  for the years ended june  and the company s history of bad debts has been less than of revenue 
because of the nature of the auction business of the company  there is a relationship between accounts receivable  advances to consignors  and payable to consignors 
depending upon the relationship of the balance sheet date to a given auction sale date and a settlement date for a given auction  these balances could change substantially from one balance sheet date to another 
in the cycle of any single auction  the effect on the balance sheet and on the company s cash flows is significant when compared to the total assets of the company 
the cycle for a single auction begins with consignors contracting with the company to sell their property at auction 
typically these contracts are signed from to weeks in advance of the auction sale date 
no entry is made on the balance sheet of the company when the company receives the property for auction or when a contract for the consignment to the auction is signed 
since the contract for the sale of the property is for services not yet rendered  there is no financial statement impact 
at the time of the consignment  or any time thereafter until the auction sale date  the consignor may request a cash advance which is a prepaid portion of the prices to be realized of the property irrevocably committed to be sold in the auction 
the cash advance takes the form of a self liquidating  secured loan to the consignor  using the property consigned as collateral 
cash advances to consignors are often used as a marketing tool in order to obtain property for a sale 
when the cash advance is made  there is an increase of the accounts of the company in cash advances to consignors  and simultaneously  there is a corresponding decrease in cash 
approximately weeks after the auction date  often referred to as the settlement date  the payables to consignors decrease to zero as all the consignors are paid and the company withholds a portion of the amounts due the consignor for the sale of the property as an offset to repay the principal amount and the accrued interest on the cash advances to consignors or loans to consignors  and there is a decrease in cash  corresponding to the net amount paid to the consignors 
the entire cycle for a single auction typically is about to weeks in duration 
because of the high level of activity in the company  single auction cycles do not occur in series  with the next cycle beginning immediately after the previous cycle ends 
rather  single auction cycles occur in parallel 
for example  when a certain cycle ends  a second cycle may be at the midpoint  while yet a third cycle is just beginning 
depending upon the relative values of the property consigned to each sale in the three cycles in this example  and depending upon the demand for auction advances in each of the cycles  the cumulative effect on the balance sheet  and particularly the current assets and current liabilities and the company s cash flows  is very significant 
inflation the effect of inflation on the company has not been significant during the last three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which the company relies are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following o revenue recognition o allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns o inventory valuation and classification o goodwill and intangible assets o accounting for income taxes in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our senior management has reviewed the company s critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue recognition the company derives revenues from two primary sources merchant dealer operations revenues from merchant dealer operations consist of revenues from the non auction sale of inventory owned by the company 
these sales consist of sales by spectrum  sales by the company to afinsa and other non auction sales of owned inventory  including private treaty sales 
revenue with respect to merchant dealer operations is recognized when the goods are delivered or released to the customer for acceptance or to a common carrier for delivery 
such amounts of revenue are recorded as sales of merchandise  net of returns 
sales returns have not been material 
auction revenue revenues from auction operations consist of the portion of sale proceeds from auction or private treaty  if the goods sold are consigned that the company is entitled to retain after remitting the sellers share  consisting primarily of commissions paid by sellers and buyers 
revenue is recognized when collectibles are sold at auction and is represented by an auction commission received from the buyer and seller 
auction commissions represent a percentage of the hammer price at auction sales as paid by the buyer and the seller 
such amounts of revenue are recorded on a net basis as commission revenue 
the company also sells its own inventory at auction 
revenue of owned inventory is recognized when sold at auction 
such amounts of revenue are recorded on a gross basis as sales of merchandise 
additionally  the company is entitled to auction commissions paid by the buyer 
sales returns have not been material 
the company does not provide any guarantee with respect to the authenticity of property offered for sale at auction 
each lot is sold as genuine and as described by the company in the catalogue 
when however  in the opinion of a competent authority mutually acceptable to the company and the purchaser  a lot is declared otherwise  the purchase price will be refunded in full if the lot is returned to the company within a specified period 
in such event  the company will return such lot to the consignor before a settlement payment has been made to such consignor for the lot in question 
to date  returns have not been material 
large collections are generally sold on an as is basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns the company makes judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding auction and consignor advances receivables and provides allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
the company continuously monitors payments from its customers and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the period they become known 
the company frequently extends trade credit in connection with its auction sales  which are held throughout the united states 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis  generally the customers who receive trade credit are professional dealers who have regularly purchased property at the company s auctions or whose reputation within the industry is known and respected by the company 
in situations where trade credit is extended  the purchaser generally takes possession of the property before payment is made by the purchaser to the company  and the company is liable to the consignor for the net sales proceeds auction hammer price less commission to the company 
the company pays the consignor generally no later than the th day after the sale  and when trade credit is extended  the company assumes all risk of loss associated with the trade credit  and the responsibility of collection of the trade credit amount from the purchaser 
losses to date under these situations have not been material 
certain sales of inventory owned by the company are made with extended payment terms up to twelve months 
certain assets held by the company collateralize these receivables 
if the historical data the company uses to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
in recording any additional allowances  a respective charge against income is reflected in the general and administrative expenses  and would reduce our operating results in the period in which the increase is recorded 
inventory valuation and classification inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market lcm  which reflects management s estimates of net realizable value 
inventories are accounted for under the specific identification method 
in instances where bulk purchases are made  the cost allocation is based on the estimated market values of the respective goods 
the company periodically reviews the age and turnover of its inventory to determine whether any inventory has declined in value and incurs a charge to operations for such declines 
the company records write downs based on two methodologies  specific write downs on certain items based on declines in the marketplace  and estimated write downs based on a percentage of the inventory aging by category type  unless the company implores a marketing strategy to sell goods over time 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management and the company s estimates prove to be inaccurate  additional write downs or adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required 
increases in write downs and adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are identified and a resulting charge to cost of merchandise sold is recorded which would reduce our operating results in the period in which the increase is recorded 
in certain instances  the company holds inventory for a period of time in excess of one year  which is generally based on a marketing strategy to sell collectibles over time in order to avoid flooding the marketplace 
inventories  which are not expected to be sold within one year  are classified with other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets goodwill goodwill primarily includes the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired 
effective july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  the company ceased amortization of goodwill and tests its goodwill on an annual basis using a two step fair value based test 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
management has determined that it operates as one reporting unit and therefore assesses goodwill for impairment on an enterprise wide basis 
management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using the company s market capitalization  which determines if the carrying value of goodwill is impaired 
if impairment is determined  the company will recognize additional charges to operating expenses in the period in which they are identified  which would result in a reduction of operating results and a reduction in the amount of goodwill 
prior to the adoption of sfas on july   the company amortized goodwill over its estimated useful life and evaluated goodwill for impairment in conjunction with its other long lived assets 
other intangible assets other purchased intangibles consisting of trademarks and customer lists  purchased as part of business acquisitions are presented net of related accumulated amortization and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining useful lives 
the company records impairment losses on other intangible assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired and the estimated fair value of the asset is less than its recorded amount in accordance with sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews the value of its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include material adverse changes in operations  significant adverse differences in actual results in comparison with initial valuation forecasts prepared at the time of acquisition  a decision to abandon certain acquired products  services or marketplaces  or other significant adverse changes that would indicate the carrying amount of the recorded asset might not be recoverable 
annually  the company performs this analysis with assistance from an independent valuation expert 
the company evaluates the recoverability of other purchased intangibles using undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing these analyses uses the best information available in the circumstances including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the income tax expense provision 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered 
the company assesses the likelihood of our deferred tax assets being recovered from future taxable income 
the company then provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which the company does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased in the future to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any change in the valuation allowance could have a material impact on net income in the period in which such determination is made 
new accounting pronouncements refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
safe harbor statement from time to time  information provided by the company  including but not limited to statements in this report  or other statements made by or on behalf of the company  may contain forward looking information within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
the cautionary statements set forth below identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company o although the company s results of operations for the years ended june  and reflect a material improvement over the results of prior periods  a significant portion of the company s aggregate sales  revenue and gross profit for such periods was attributable to sales to afinsa a related party 
there is no assurance that such sales  revenues and gross profit will continue at these levels 
a decrease in the level of sales to afinsa  or the termination of the supply agreements with afinsa could have a material adverse effect on the company 
there is no minimum level of sales provided for under the supply agreements with afinsa  and the agreements may be terminated upon six month s notice by either party 
o our recent acquisitions of companies  in particular those which operate outside the united states  have provided us with challenges in implementing the required processes and procedures in our those operations 
we  therefore  have devoted substantial time and have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs to ensure ongoing compliance 
in addition  in the course of our ongoing evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting  we have identified areas of our internal controls requiring improvement and are in the process of designing enhanced processes and controls to address those issues 
as a result  we expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of management s time  any of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income or increase our net losses 
and  we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective or sufficient for us to issue reports in the future 
any such events could adversely affect our financial results and or may result in a negative reaction in the stock market 
o subsequent to the year ended june   the company and its majority shareholder afinsa acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of a mark precious metals  inc apm  which is a metals trading company engaged primarily in the wholesale purchase and sale of precious metals  including gold  silver and platinum and palladium 
apm s precious metals inventories are subject to market value changes created by changes in the underlying commodity markets 
in addition  open purchase and sale commitments are subject to changes in value between the time the purchase or sale is fixed and the time metal is delivered 
apm seeks to minimize the effect of price changes of the underlying commodity through the use of financial derivative instruments  such as forward and futures contracts 
apm s policy is to remain substantially hedged as to its inventory position and as to its purchase and sale commitments  and apm s management monitors its hedged exposure daily 
however  there can be no assurance that these hedging activities will be adequate to protect the company against commodity price risks associated with apm s business activities 
o during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company made a charitable contribution of an art collection with a de minimis carrying value that had been held for investment purposes 
the company obtained a qualified appraisal of the collection  which concluded that it had a value of approximately million  resulting in a charitable contribution deduction with a tax benefit of approximately million 
this charitable contribution deduction will be limited to of the company s federal taxable income as computed with certain adjustments each year and will expire in the year to the extent not utilized 
because of the uncertainty of whether future federal taxable income will be sufficient to realize the entire benefit  the company has established a valuation allowance of approximately million 
in addition  although not required to do so  the company has determined to seek additional verification of the value of the collection 
as a result of this or other factors  the tax benefit to the company may be adjusted 
o at times there may be a limited supply of collectibles available for sale by the company 
such supply historically has varied from time to time 
while the company has not generally experienced a lack of collectibles that has prevented it from conducting appropriately sized auctions on an acceptable schedule  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to obtain consignments of suitable quantities of collectibles in order to conduct auctions of the size  and at the times  the company may desire in the future 
the inability to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company 
furthermore  the popularity of collectibles could decline 
this could affect the market value of inventory that gmai currently holds  including the inventory acquired under the inventory purchase agreement  or inventory it or its subsidiaries may acquire in the future 
o the business of selling stamps  coins  and other collectibles at auction and in retail sales is highly competitive 
the company competes with a number of auction houses and collectibles companies throughout the north america  europe and the rest of the world 
while the company believes that there is no dominant company in the stamp auction or collectibles business in which it operates  there can be no assurances that other companies with greater financial and other resources and name recognition will not enter the market 
among the company s primary competitors in the domestic and worldwide philatelic auction business are matthew bennett  inc  charles shreve galleries  inc and robert a 
siegel auction galleries  inc in the sports trading card auction business  the company s primary competitors are mastro fine sports auctions  sports trading cards plus  llc and sales online direct  inc d b a rotman auctions 
the company s principal coin auction competitors are heritage rare coin galleries  inc  stacks rare coins  superior coin galleries of beverly hills and american numismatic rarities  llc 
o auctentia and afinsa currently beneficially own approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
this represents a substantial dilution in the current voting power of non auctentia related stockholders of the company 
as a result  auctentia and its affiliates are able to elect the entire board of directors of gmai 
auctentia and its affiliates also may be able to approve other actions as a stockholder without obtaining the votes of other stockholders of the company or impede transactions that may be desirable for other stockholders 
in addition  this concentration of ownership  which is not subject to any voting restrictions  could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for the company s common stock 
o the company and auctentia have signed a registration rights agreement pursuant to which auctentia may request that  shares of the company s common stock beneficially owned by it be registered by the company at the company s expense 
all such registerable company common stock owned by auctentia will be freely tradable immediately after any registration 
o the company has acquired businesses within the last two years  including eight in europe and one in hong kong 
integration of these operations have presented and will continue to present challenges to management  including with respect to the integration of the operations  product lines  technologies and personnel of the company and its subsidiaries 
these acquisitions also pose special risks  including possible unanticipated liabilities  unanticipated costs and diversion of management attention 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the combined businesses will achieve increased sales levels  profitability  efficiencies or synergies  or result in increased earnings for the combined companies in any future period 
the difficulties of combining the operations of gmai and the european subsidiaries are also complicated by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations 
o the company s business will be adversely affected if use of the internet by consumers  particularly purchasers of collectibles  does not continue to grow 
a number of factors may inhibit consumers from using the internet 
these include inadequate network infrastructure  security concerns  inconsistent quality of service and a lack of cost effective high speed service 
even if internet use grows  the internet s infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline 
in addition  many web sites have experienced service interruptions as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet infrastructure 
if these outages or delays occur frequently in the future  use of the internet  as well as use of our web sites  could grow more slowly or decline 
o some local telephone carriers claim that the increasing popularity of the internet has burdened the existing telecommunications infrastructure and that many areas with high internet use are experiencing interruptions in telephone service 
these carriers have petitioned the us federal communications commission to impose access fees on internet service providers 
if these access fees are imposed  the cost of communicating on the internet could increase  and this could decrease the demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business 
o the company holds rights to various web domain names 
governmental agencies typically regulate domain names 
these regulations are subject to change 
gmai may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which it or its affiliates do business 
furthermore  regulations governing domain names may not protect the company s trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
the company may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to  infringe upon or diminish the value of its trademarks and other proprietary rights 
o due to difficulty anticipating levels or values of consignments at any given time  the stamp auction business is susceptible to significant fluctuations in operating results and revenue shortfalls  which could adversely affect the company s business 
in addition  the company s operating results in the coin business are dependent upon product availability over the short and long term  which cannot be predicted with any certainty 
future fluctuations in operating results or revenue shortfalls of the company could adversely affect the success of the company 
if revenue fails to offset operating expenses in the future  the company may be required to fund future operations through the sale of additional common stock  which could cause the market price of its stock to decline  as well as have a dilutive effect on the value of its common stock currently outstanding 
o the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  some of which may be beyond the company s control  including sales of the company s common stock by stockholders  actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company s operating results  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies  developments and publicity regarding the company s industry  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the company s common stock  regardless of the company s actual performance  and could enhance the effect of any fluctuations that do relate to its operating results 
o the company may be adversely affected by the costs and other effects associated with i legal and administrative cases and proceedings  ii settlements  investigations  claims and changes in those items  and iii adoption of new  or changes in  accounting policies and practices and the application of such policies and practices 
o the company s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards promulgated by the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission  and the american institute of certified public accountants 
o our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
our effective tax rate is directly affected by the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are also subject to changing tax laws  regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate 
our effective tax rate can also be influenced by the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and non recurring charges  which may cause fluctuations between reporting periods 
this list should not be considered an exhaustive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial market prices  including interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  investment risk  commodity price risk and other relevant market rate or price risks 
interest rate risks interest rates on the company s credit facilities are market based 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the company is exposed to certain interest rate risks caused by fluctuations in interest rates 
if  for example  the libor and the prime rates were to increase by for any given year  our interest expense would increase by approximately for the period assuming that all amounts available under such credit facilities that is   are drawn down 
there can be no assurance that interest rates will not increase over the next fiscal year 
however  because we do not believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is significant  we have not undertaken specific steps to reduce or eliminate this risk 
foreign currency risks business transactions originating from our united states and asian operations are denominated in us dollars 
transactions from our european operations  which in fiscal accounted for approximately of total net revenues  are denominated in euros 
the average euro to dollar exchange rate during fiscal was us dollar to euro 
as a result of this exchange rate  the company enjoyed a favorable exchange rate advantage equal to million in fiscal a change in the euro to dollar exchange rate would have had a effect on the company s net profits in fiscal of  the company does not believe it is exposed to material foreign currency risks 
as a result  we do not enter into any hedging activities to minimize such risk 
other market risks the company maintains investments in equity instruments of public and privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in marketable securities and other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than and the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations 
for these investments  the company s policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
the company identifies and records impairment losses on long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
subsequent to the year ended june   the company and its majority shareholder afinsa acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of a mark precious metals  inc apm 
apm is a metals trading company engaged primarily in the wholesale purchase and sale of precious metals  including gold  silver  platinum and palladium 
apm s precious metals inventories are subject to market value changes created by changes in the underlying commodity markets  and open purchase and sale commitments are subject to changes in value between the time the purchase or sale is fixed and the time metal is delivered

apm s policy is to remain substantially hedged as to its inventory position and as to its purchase and sale commitments  and apm s management monitors its hedged exposure daily 
the company historically has not experienced any significant commodity price risks 
the company does not generally allow speculation in derivative instruments 
we do not intend to use financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company will assess the significance of interest rate  exchange rate and other market risks on a periodic basis and will implement strategies to manage risk as appropriate
