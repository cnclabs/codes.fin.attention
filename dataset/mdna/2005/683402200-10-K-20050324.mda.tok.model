the majority of our revenue has been generated from customers in the high technology  financial services  government  business services and healthcare industries 
accordingly  our business is affected by the economic and business conditions of these industries and the business service demand for information technology within these industries 
in addition  we are constantly reevaluating our business operations and strategy to determine what changes are likely to give us the greatest opportunity to successfully grow 
as this process continues  we will likely refine our focus on selected market segments and adjust our market positioning accordingly 
we will be focused on the following objectives in the near term successfully integrate new talent in our sales and marketing organizations  increase our pipeline of sales opportunities  enhance our market position and awareness  manage our costs to allow our return to profitability  focus our resources and efforts on the market opportunities with the highest probability of success  diversify and expand partnerships with key system integration and technology vendors  aggressively market our recent major product releases  enhance our solutions portfolio to address more customer needs  continue our focus on compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and maintain high customer satisfaction levels 

table of contents we hope that  by focusing our efforts on these key objectives  we will be able to return to profitability and successfully grow our business  although we cannot offer any assurance regarding when  or whether  this will occur 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  intangible assets  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex and often subject to interpretation 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards for software companies  including statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and related interpretations  including technical practice aids 
we generate revenue through two sources a software license revenue and b support and service revenue 
software license revenue is generated from licensing the rights to use our products directly to end users and indirectly through vars and  to a lesser extent  through third party products we distribute 
support and service revenue is generated from sales of customer support services maintenance contracts  consulting services and training services performed for customers that license our products 
license revenue is recognized when a non cancelable license agreement becomes effective as evidenced by a signed contract  the product has been shipped  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to delivered elements 
elements included in multiple element arrangements could consist of software products  maintenance which includes customer support services and unspecified upgrades  or consulting services 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change once the element is sold separately 
standard terms for license agreements call for payment within days 
probability of collection is based on the assessment of the customer s financial condition through the review of its current financial statements or credit reports 
for follow on sales to existing customers  prior payment history is also used to evaluate probability of collection 
revenue from distribution agreements with vars is typically recognized upon the earlier of receipt of cash from the var or identification of an end user 
in the latter case  probability of 
table of contents collection is evaluated based on the creditworthiness of the var 
our agreements with customers and vars do not contain product return rights 
revenue from maintenance arrangements is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenue is primarily related to implementation services performed on a time and materials basis or  in certain situations  on a fixed fee basis  under separate service arrangements 
implementation services are periodically performed under fixed fee arrangements and  in such cases  consulting revenue is recognized as services are performed 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as services are performed 
standard terms for renewal of maintenance arrangements  consulting services and training services call for payment within days 
revenue for certain long term contracts is recognized in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
revenue consisting of fees from licenses sold together with consulting services is generally recognized upon shipment of the software  provided that the above criteria are met  payment of the license fees do not depend on the performance of the services  and the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of the license fees depends on the performance of the services  both the software license and consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if a nonstandard acceptance period is provided  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
allowance for doubtful accounts a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current creditworthiness of each customer 
although we recorded a net benefit in and a small amount of expenses were recorded to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts in  significant expenses were recorded to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts in prior years due to the rapid downturn in the economy  and in the technology sector in particular  and we may record additional expenses in the future 
impairment of goodwill we periodically evaluate goodwill asset valuations of businesses we acquired as impairment indicators arise 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
in addition to testing goodwill for impairment when impairment indicators arise  we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill per the guidance outlined in statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our chosen annual impairment testing date is november  restructuring during and  we recorded significant write offs and accruals in connection with our restructuring program under emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
these write offs and accruals include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations related to excess leased facilities and other contracts 
although we believe that we have made reasonable estimates of our restructuring costs in calculating these write offs and accruals  the actual costs could differ from these estimates 
with the contractual settlement of the majority of our excess facilities  the range of outcomes that must be estimated has narrowed significantly 

table of contents in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a meaningful basis to predict our future performance 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by technology companies  particularly companies in rapidly evolving markets 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties 
our future operating results will depend on many factors  including general economic conditions  which may affect our customers capital investment levels in management information systems and the timing of their purchases  the loss of any key technical  sales  customer support or management personnel and the timing of any new hires  budget and spending decisions by our prospective and existing customers  customers and prospects decisions to defer orders or implementations  particularly large orders or implementations  from one quarter to the next  or to proceed with smaller than forecasted orders or implementations  level of purchases by our existing customers  including additional license and maintenance revenues  our ability to compete in the highly competitive customer management systems market  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and product versions on a timely basis  rate of market acceptance of our solutions  variability in the mix of our license versus service revenue  the mix of our direct versus indirect license revenue and the mix of services that we perform versus those performed by third party service providers  our ability to successfully expand our operations  and the amount and timing of expenditures related to this expansion  the costs we incur as a result of our ongoing efforts to comply with the regulations promulgated under the sarbanes oxley act of  the cost and financial accounting effects of any acquisitions of companies or complementary technologies that we may complete  and the expense we incur as a result of an impairment in our goodwill

no single customer accounted for more than of our revenue in any of these periods 
our license revenue decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of  and increased to million in  an increase of 
we believe the decrease in license revenue from to was primarily due to the progressive weakening of the global economy  which caused a delay in the capital spending initiatives of our prospective and existing customers 
the increase in license revenue from to was primarily due to an increase in license revenue sold to new and existing customers  as well as license sales of new products 
we believe that this increase in license revenue reflects a more favorable climate for investment by businesses in the types of solutions we offer  as well as increased effectiveness in marketing our products  particularly to larger enterprise customers 
although recent published reports are signaling 
table of contents modest improvement in the global economy  we are cautious as to the speed at which macroeconomic conditions will improve  and believe our ability to generate new license sales will continue to be challenged in the near term 
support and service revenue decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of

the decrease from to was the result of a decrease in consulting and training services revenue of million and a decrease in maintenance and support revenue of  service revenue represented of our total revenue in  in and in we expect our support and service revenue to remain flat or slightly down in terms of dollars in relative to in addition  we may experience a decline in maintenance revenue as customers elect not to renew annual maintenance contracts in part or as a whole  primarily due to specific economic circumstances facing each of our customers 
we expect the proportion of support and service revenue to total revenue to fluctuate in the future  depending in part on our customers direct use of third party consulting and implementation service providers  the degree to which we provide opportunities for our partners to engage with our customers and the ongoing renewals of customer support contracts  as well as our overall sales of software licenses to new and existing customers 
revenue outside of north america decreased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in we believe the decrease in revenue from to and from to outside of north america was primarily due to an adverse shift in the buying behavior of our targeted new customers and existing customer base

cost of support and service revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of 
the increase in dollar amount from to is due to a higher concentration of professional service revenue  which has a higher cost structure and contributes lower margins than support revenue 
the decrease in dollar amount from to resulted primarily from a reduction in professional

full time headcount in our professional services organization was at the end of  at the end of and at the end of cost of support and service revenue as a percentage of related support and service revenues was in  in and in the increase in cost of service revenue as a percentage of related service revenue from to primarily reflects a higher proportion of service revenue from consulting and training services  which have a higher direct cost structure and therefore contribute lower margins than our customer support services 
the decrease in cost of service revenue as a percentage of related service revenue from to primarily reflects an increase in utilization rates for our direct consulting and training services in the cost of services as a percentage of service revenue may vary between periods primarily for two reasons the mix of services we provide consulting  customer support  training  which have different direct cost structures  and the resources we use to deliver these services internal versus third parties

at december   the warrant value was estimated at  using similar assumptions to those used at december   and is included in long term liabilities 
the current portion of restructuring related liabilities totaled  at december  the accounting for excess facilities is complex and requires judgment  a consequence of which is that adjustments may be required to our current restructuring charge 
in particular  based on the terms of the warrants issued in connection with the partial lease termination of excess facilities in bellevue  washington  the warrants were subject to variable accounting and were marked to market at each reporting period prior to january  when the change in control provision in the warrants expired
