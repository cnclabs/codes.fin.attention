table of contents while we expect the opportunity for partnered e commerce to continue to grow  we also anticipate competition to continue to be intense 
we compete with traditional  in house solutions as well as a variety of third party vendors that provide e commerce software or partial e commerce solutions 
to satisfy our existing partners and to continue to attract new partners  we offer what we believe is a comprehensive and compelling value proposition that includes the provision of expertise and infrastructure to enable our partners to grow their e commerce businesses and to use their e commerce businesses as a channel to complement and enhance their offline businesses 
we have built and continue to develop expertise in integrated online technology  marketing and retailing  which we deliver across a shared technology  supporting infrastructure and partner services platform 
to differentiate our solution in the marketplace  we continually add new services and functions to our platform 
as part of our continuing efforts to add value to our platform  we evaluate opportunities to acquire complimentary or new businesses or assets 
we grow our business by expanding the e commerce businesses of our existing partners and by adding new partners 
in fiscal  we added nine new partners 
as of march   we have added three new partners in fiscal generally  we launch the website of a new partner within three to six months after entering into a contract with such new partner 
during the period in which we are planning and developing a new partner s web site  we incur development and launch expenses without any accompanying revenues 
we anticipate that new web sites typically will contribute to our income from operations in their first full year of operation 
we derive virtually all of our revenues from sales of products by us through our partners e commerce businesses and service fees earned by us in connection with the development and operation of our partners e commerce businesses 
our revenue growth in fiscal was due to an increase in revenues from product sales in both our sporting goods and other categories  as well as an increase in service fee revenues 
these increases were driven by the addition of new partners in fiscal  growth in sales from partners e commerce businesses that were operated for part of fiscal and all of fiscal and growth in sales from partners e commerce businesses that we operated for the entirety of both periods 
our gross profit increased as a result of sales growth and an increase in gross margin 
the gross margin increase was a result of service fees representing a greater percentage of net revenues in fiscal than in fiscal we specifically do not record cost of service fee revenue 
the cost of sales of the merchandise on which we earn service fees are costs incurred by our service fee partners because they are the owners and sellers of the merchandise

our gross margin on products has typically been impacted by the mix of products sold between our sporting goods and other categories as well as within our sporting goods category 
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily as a result of sales and marketing expenses increasing at a slower rate than net revenues 
fiscal was our first profitable year since entering the e commerce business in fiscal we had net income of million or per share on a fully diluted basis

r share based payment  or fas r  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  in addition  fas r will cause expense related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining vesting period 
we are required to adopt fas r beginning july  we are evaluating the requirements of fas r and we expect that the adoption of fas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share

while we had net income of 
million for fiscal  we did not realize net income for the full years of fiscal  fiscal or fiscal in order to fund our anticipated operating expenses and realize net income  our revenues must continue to increase significantly 
in the future  we may seek to raise capital through financing transactions 
if we are unable to raise capital  or if we raise less capital than we desire  or if cash flows are insufficient to fund our expenses  we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund our operations 
failure to raise future capital when needed could seriously harm our business and operating results 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our current stockholders would be reduced to the extent they did not participate in that financing 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting polices  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions

we act as principal in these transactions  as orders are initiated directly through the e commerce businesses that we operate  we take title to the goods at the shipping point and have the economic risk related to collection  customer service and returns 
we consider the criteria presented in eitf  no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining the appropriate revenue recognition treatment

we have considered the revenue reduction provisions addressed in eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  which was codified in eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  and believe that the payment of partner revenue share charges  or the issuance of warrants or stock in lieu of cash partner revenue share charges  to our partners should not result in any reduction of revenues

do not apply

based upon these judgments and estimates  which are applied consistently from period to period  we record valuation allowances to adjust the carrying amount of our inventory 
we record a charge for obsolescence based upon  among other factors  the amount of inventory which has an aging of greater than one year and the anticipated mark downs required to sell the inventory in the normal course of business

we are required to adopt fas r in our third quarter of  beginning july  under fas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
we have preliminarily decided to use the prospective method for transition as of the effective date of fas r 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of fas r 
we are evaluating the requirements of fas r and we expect that the adoption of fas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share

we invest our excess cash in institutional money market accounts  auction rate certificates  us government agencies  corporate bonds and auction preferred stock

we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or it may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates
