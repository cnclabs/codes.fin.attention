item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of ralcorp holdings  inc this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements under item  especially note  and the cautionary statement on forward looking statements on page the terms we  our  company  and ralcorp as used herein refer to ralcorp holdings  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
recently issued accounting standards see note for a discussion regarding the recently issued accounting standard  fas revised 
results of operations consolidated fiscal was a challenging year as we faced intense cost pressures across all reporting segments cereals  crackers cookies  dressings  syrups  jellies sauces  snack nuts candy  and frozen bakery products 
we continue to benefit from our acquisition strategy while experiencing organic growth in many categories 
largely on the strength of realizing full year benefits of the fiscal acquisitions  our net earnings and net sales increased 
the following table summarizes key data in millions of dollars  except for percentage data as indicated for the past three years that we believe is important for you to note as you read the consolidated results analysis discussions which follow 
net earnings net sales cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales sg a as a percentage of net sales interest expense goodwill impairment loss restructuring charges litigation settlement income effective income tax rate equity in earnings loss of vail resorts  inc net earnings earnings for were reduced by a goodwill impairment loss of million after taxes 
earnings improved since as a result of business acquisitions  organic growth  and improved earnings from our investment in vail resorts  inc more detailed discussion and analysis of these and other factors follows 
net sales approximately half of s increase in net sales is attributable to the timing of business acquisitions 
ralcorp acquired the bakery chef business on december   the concept bakers cb business on february   and the medallion foods business on june  excluding sales from the two businesses acquired during fiscal  net sales for that year grew by from we explain other factors affecting net sales in the segment discussions below 
operating expenses the fiscal cost of products sold percentage declined primarily as a result of changes in business mix 
in addition  it was favorably impacted by production efficiencies due to increased volumes and lower accelerated depreciation related to restructuring projects 
although the prices of energy  freight  and several ingredients increased significantly compared to prior year costs  most of the effects were mitigated during fiscal through hedging  forward purchase contracts  and selling price increases 
the cost of products sold percentage increased in fiscal primarily as a result of continued significant increases in freight rates 
although expenses associated with the implementation of large scale information systems upgrades and conversions and other unallocated corporate expenses have increased significantly over the past three years  the sg a percentage was slightly lower as other costs have generally been held steady or reduced while net sales grew 
the systems conversion costs consisted of both project costs amounting to million in  million in  and million in and unallocated systems maintenance costs and amortization 
our policy is to charge divisions  including the corporate headquarters  costs of centralized systems based on usage 
during periods of transition  when more than one system is being utilized by the company  this approach results in unallocated amounts representing the duplication of costs 
these excess transitional amounts are reported as unallocated corporate expenses within sg a 
again  refer to the segment discussions below for other factors affecting cost of products sold and sg a expenses 
in addition  refer to our policy regarding cost of products sold in note because our gross profit percentages may not be comparable to those of other companies who report cost of products sold on a different basis 
interest expense  net net interest expense has increased as a result of changing debt levels and interest rates 
long term debt was relatively low during fiscal  ending the year at million 
since nearly all of our interest rates were set on a short term basis during that time  the declining market rates also had a favorable effect on interest expense 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we issued million in fixed rate notes  and market rates started to rise 
the weighted average interest rate on all of the company s outstanding debt was in  in  and in for more information about our long term debt  see note refer to note for information about our agreement to sell our trade accounts receivable on an ongoing basis  including amounts of related discounts 
goodwill impairment loss we recorded a goodwill impairment loss in fiscal in accordance with fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test of each of our reporting units during the fourth quarter 
the implied fair value of goodwill in the carriage house reporting unit ie  the dressings  syrups  jellies sauces segment was calculated to be million  compared to the carrying value of million  so the goodwill impairment loss was determined to be million 
a portion of carriage house s goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes  so the deferred tax benefit of the loss was only million 
factors leading to the impairment included the bankruptcy of fleming companies  inc formerly a significant customer of carriage house  the inability to quickly replace lost co manufacturing business  the increasing competitive pricing pressures in the private label food industry  and the near term production inefficiencies arising from the fiscal carriage house restructuring initiatives discussed below 
restructuring charges in fiscal  we closed our leased plant in city of industry  ca  and transferred much of the production to other facilities within the dressings  syrups  jellies sauces segment 
this project  which included termination benefits and other charges totaling million  is expected to result in annual savings net of certain increased costs and lost sales of approximately million beginning in fiscal in  the company closed its plant in kansas city  ks  and moved production to other facilities within the dressings  syrups  jellies sauces segment 
related restructuring charges included termination benefits  a loss from the write down of property value  and other charges totaling million in and 
million in annual cost savings from this project are estimated to be million 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced our plans to close our in store bakery isb facility in kent  wa  part of the cereals  crackers cookies segment  and began transferring production from that facility and two other isb facilities to a new isb plant located in utah 
this project was substantially completed in fiscal and resulted in estimated annual cost savings of to million 
restructuring charges for this project totaled 
million in fiscal  million in  and million in  including operating lease termination costs  costs related to the removal and relocation of equipment  equipment write offs  and employee termination benefits 
in fiscal  the company reduced operations at its facility in streator  il  and transferred production of all product lines except peanut butter to other dressings  syrups  jellies sauces locations to realize annual cost savings of to million 
related employee termination benefits and equipment write offs totaled million 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we sold our ketchup business  including certain equipment and inventory  and recorded a net loss of million 
further  we determined that the resulting reduced cash flows from our tomato paste business  which had supplied the company s ketchup production  was less than the carrying value of our paste production facility located near williams  ca  and an impairment charge of million was recorded as of december  on february   we sold the tomato paste business  including the williams facility  and recorded an additional loss of million 
the ketchup and paste operations were both relatively minor parts of the dressings  syrups  jellies sauces segment 
for more information regarding these restructuring charges  see note litigation settlement income we received payments in fiscal   and in settlement of certain claims related to antitrust litigation 
future amounts are not expected to be significant 
income taxes income tax provisions generally reflect statutory tax rates  adjusted by the effects of impairment losses and favorable resolutions of uncertain tax positions 
the effective rate was reduced by the effect of approximately million related to favorable resolutions of uncertain tax positions 
the rate included the effect of the non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment loss 
excluding that effect  the rate was about 
the effective rate is also affected by changes in our business mix which affect state tax provisions 
see note for more information about income taxes 
equity in earnings of vail resorts  inc as noted previously  earnings from our investment in vail resorts nyse ticker mtn improved over the past three years 
for fiscal  our recorded pre tax loss from the vail investment included an unfavorable adjustment of 
million to reflect the cumulative effect of vail s earnings restatement for prior years

cereals  crackers cookies fiscal vs 
fiscal for the year ended september   net sales for the cereals  crackers cookies segment were up from fiscal  with ralston foods and bremner contributing increases of million and million  respectively 
the medallion acquisition added million to net sales  while the rest of the ralston foods increase was driven by continued expansion with existing customers and the effect of a change in product mix 
ready to eat cereal sales volume was up for the year in an overall category that continues to show minimal growth  while hot cereal and foodservice volumes increased and  respectively  and ralston foods co manufacturing volume was down 
bremner s net sales growth is attributable to a increase in sales volume and improved pricing on some products 
bremner s cracker and cookie volumes were up and  respectively again excluding co manufacturing 
bremner comparisons were helped by incremental sales to former customers of bake line group  llc  which ceased operations during the second quarter of last year  but sales volume under co manufacturing arrangements was lower than last year 
the segment s profit contribution improved for the year 
medallion contributed approximately million net of 
million of amortization of acquired intangible assets  while the existing businesses contributed less than last year as a result of higher costs 
freight costs were up about million due to higher rates  warehousing costs increased approximately million  and commodity costs were slightly higher 
the decline in sales under co manufacturing agreements reduced segment profit by approximately million 
fiscal vs 
fiscal for the year ended september   net sales for the cereals  crackers cookies segment were up million from fiscal  with ralston foods and bremner contributing increases of million and million  respectively 
for ralston foods  most of the increase was the result of growth in rte cereal sales volume  partially offset by a decline in hot cereal volume 
in addition  net sales from rte co manufacturing were up million for the year 
bremner s cracker and cookie volumes were up 
the segment s profit contribution improved for the year 
production efficiencies  favorable sales mix  and lower information systems expense were partially offset by higher costs of rice  corn  wheat  soybean oil  eggs  raisins  freight  and energy 
dressings  syrups  jellies sauces our dressings  syrups  jellies sauces segment s net sales rose to million in fiscal from million in  which had declined from million in in  gains of approximately million from higher pricing were offset by the impact of a half percent volume decline and a 
million decrease due to unfavorable mix 
the decline was due primarily to the exit from the ketchup and industrial tomato paste businesses during  the effects of the fleming bankruptcy in april  and the loss of a major pourable salad dressing customer in the second half of fiscal these sales reductions were partially offset by increased business with several customers  as well as by price increases on some product lines in an attempt to mitigate escalating costs of certain ingredients 
the segment s profit contribution was   and of net sales in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the profit percentage was low as a result of increased production costs due to inefficiencies related to the significant volume decline and restructuring initiatives  pricing pressures  and charges related to the fleming bankruptcy 
in fiscal  we saw production cost improvements from our restructuring and process improvement projects 
fiscal profit improved slightly  despite increases in the costs of freight million  packaging million  and ingredients such as soybean oil and fruit million 
the segment benefited from lower workers compensation expense million  overhead savings from the kansas city plant closure million  reduced expenses incurred to determine and implement cost savings initiatives more than million  lower broker commission expenses million  and the continued benefits of cost reduction projects that have improved the segment s sg a cost structure 
snack nuts candy net sales for the snack nuts candy segment increased in fiscal after jumping in fiscal in  a decrease in volume was more than offset by improved pricing on several items  which had lagged commodity cost increases last year 
the growth came primarily from increases in orders from existing top customers for both continuing and new private label items  but also from price increases on certain products 
the profit contribution for the segment increased million  as the benefits of improved pricing were largely offset by higher costs 
costs of tree nuts primarily almonds  pecans  and cashews were unfavorable by million  and freight costs increased by 
million 
the segment s profit contribution decreased million from as price increases lagged increases in the cost of ingredients especially tree nuts such as macadamias  almonds  and pecans 
the profit comparison was made more difficult by significantly reduced peanut costs in  followed by competitive pricing pressures that reduced peanut margins in in  the weighted average ingredient costs per pound were approximately higher than in the prior year 
in addition  fiscal profit was reduced by higher energy costs and information systems costs 
frozen bakery products the frozen bakery products segment consists of bakery chef and the isb group  composed of the cascade  lofthouse and concept bakers cb acquisitions 
cascade and lofthouse were acquired in fiscal and  respectively  while the purchases of bakery chef and cb were completed on december   and february   respectively 
net sales of frozen bakery products have grown from million in fiscal to million in and million in  largely as a result of the timing of the fiscal acquisitions 
bakery chef and cb added approximately million of net sales in  and the additional two and five months of results from bakery chef and cb  respectively  generated an extra million in the remaining increase was primarily driven by stronger foodservice and isb sales volume partially offset by lower retail griddle products volume  and small improvements in foodservice pricing 
the segment s profit contribution was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
again  most of this improvement was due to the timing of acquisitions  which added approximately million of profit in and million during the extra months in in addition  fiscal profit benefited from favorable volume  lower ingredient costs approximately million  improved manufacturing efficiencies particularly due to the isb plant consolidation  and pricing 
those benefits were partially offset by approximately million of higher freight costs  about million of incentive compensation not paid in  and 
million of additional intangible asset amortization expense compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded operating needs by generating positive cash flows through operations 
we expect to continue generating operating cash flows through our mix of businesses and expect that short term and long term liquidity requirements will be met through a combination of operating cash flows and strategic use of borrowings under committed and uncommitted credit arrangements 
capital resources remained strong at september   with total shareholders equity of million and a long term debt to total capital which is the total of long term debt and total shareholders equity ratio of percent  compared to corresponding figures for september   of million and percent 
working capital  excluding cash and cash equivalents  decreased to million at september   from million at september   primarily as a result of a million decrease in our investment in ralcorp receivables corporation  offset by million of dividends paid in october declared in september and the addition of the medallion business 
operating activities cash flows from operating activities were million  million  and million in   and  respectively  affected most significantly by proceeds from our accounts receivable sale program 
operating cash flows were augmented in fiscal by million of proceeds from the sale of ownership interests in accounts receivable 
in fiscal   and  we reduced the amount of interests sold  with decreases of million  million  and million  respectively 
as of september   we did not sell any ownership interests  but during fiscal  we sold million of such interests 
see off balance sheet financing below for more information about the sale of receivables 
in fiscal  an emphasis on working capital reduction resulted in lower inventory levels  while inventory amounts rose in and due to increases in both quantities to support higher sales volumes and costs 
accounts payable have fluctuated due to the timing of purchases  and receivables have fluctuated due to the timing of sales 
in both and  operating cash flows were reduced by a million contribution to our qualified pension plan  included in other  net on the statement of cash flows 
we do not expect to be required to make any significant contributions to this plan in fiscal see note for more information about pension plans  including the funded status 
investing activities net cash paid for business acquisitions totaled million in fiscal medallion and million in fiscal bakery chef and cb 
see note for more information about these acquisitions 
on november   we purchased western waffles  ltd 
see note subsequent events 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to the information systems projects  restructuring projects  and projects at the recently acquired businesses 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be between and million 
as discussed below  we have adequate capacity under current borrowing arrangements to meet these cash needs 
financing activities in  we issued floating rate senior notes  series a  in the amount of  maturing in we used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our shorter term credit arrangements 
on november   million of those notes was repaid  primarily with the aforementioned million of proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable 
the bakery chef acquisition was financed primarily through a million private placement of long term fixed rate senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 
details about these notes are included in note the purchases of medallion in june and western waffles in november were financed with borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  the sale of ownership interests in accounts receivable  and cash on hand 
as of september   total remaining availability under our million revolving credit agreement and our million uncommitted credit arrangements was million 
currently  the most restrictive covenant is a maximum total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio as defined in the credit agreement of as of september   we were in compliance with all covenants  with a total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of see note for details 
including the effects of the western waffles acquisition  the vail forward sale contract discussed below  and stock repurchases through november  discussed below  the estimated ratio was approximately supplementing our available borrowing capacity  under the agreement described under off balance sheet financing below  we could choose to sell up to million of ownership interests in accounts receivable  but we had sold only million of such interests as of september  further cash needs could be met through the sale of the company s investment in vail resorts  inc  which had a market value of million at september  see note 
on october   we entered into a prepaid forward sale contract relating to million shares of our vail common stock 
under the contract  at the maturity dates half in three years and half in five years we can deliver a variable number of shares of vail to bank of america 
the number of shares ultimately delivered will depend on the price of vail shares at settlement 
we obtained approximately million under the prepaid feature of the contract 
as of november   approximately million shares remained available for repurchase by the company pursuant to authorizations by the board of directors 
a stock repurchase program was initiated in august  and we purchased million of ralcorp stock by september  an additional  shares were purchased at prevailing market prices for a total cost of million during october and november before august  the last time we repurchased shares was in fiscal  when the board approved a tender offer for up to  shares at a single price not in excess of and not less than per share 
the offer was in the form of a modified dutch auction where the final price is determined based upon the number of shares  and the respective prices  tendered 
the offer resulted in the purchase of million shares at a purchase price of per share 
on september   our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share  payable on october   to shareholders of record as of the close of business on october  the dividend payout totaled approximately million 
off balance sheet financing as an additional source of liquidity  on september   ralcorp entered into an agreement to sell  on an ongoing basis  all of its trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiary called ralcorp receivables corporation rrc 
rrc can then sell up to million of undivided percentage ownership interests in qualifying receivables to a bank commercial paper conduit the conduit 
rrc s only business activities relate to acquiring and selling interests in ralcorp s receivables 
upon the agreement s termination  the conduit would be entitled to all cash collections on rrc s accounts receivable until its purchased interest has been repaid 
unless extended  the agreement will terminate in october the trade receivables sale arrangement with rrc represents off balance sheet financing since the sale results in assets being removed from our balance sheet rather than resulting in a liability to the conduit 
the organizational documents of rrc and the terms of the agreements governing the receivables sale transactions make rrc a qualifying special purpose entity 
as such  it is not to be consolidated in ralcorp s financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles 
furthermore  the true sale nature of the arrangement requires ralcorp to account for rrc s transactions with the conduit as a sale of accounts receivable instead of reflecting the conduit s net investment as debt with a pledge of accounts receivable as collateral 
if rrc were not a qualifying special purpose entity and if the arrangement were not considered a true sale  the outstanding balance of receivables would remain on ralcorp s balance sheet  proceeds received from the conduit million as of september  would be shown as short term debt  and there would be no investment in rrc 
see further discussion in note contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into contracts and commitments which obligate us to make payments in the future 
the table below sets forth our significant future obligations by time period as of september  total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c deferred compensation obligations d total a long term debt obligations include principal payments  interest payments  and interest rate swap settlements based on interest rates at september  see note for details 
b operating lease obligations consist of minimum rental payments under noncancelable operating leases  as shown in note c purchase obligations are legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
d deferred compensation obligations have been allocated to time periods based on existing payment plans for terminated employees and the estimated timing of distributions to current employees based on age 
inflation we recognize that inflationary pressures may have an adverse effect on the company through higher asset replacement costs  related depreciation and higher material and energy costs 
we try to minimize these effects through cost reductions and productivity improvements as well as price increases to maintain reasonable profit margins 
it is our view that inflation has not had a significant impact on operations in the three years ended september currency until the acquisition of western waffles in november  all of our sales and costs were denominated in us dollars 
western waffles sells of its products representing approximately million usd  to customers in the us  but its raw materials and labor are purchased in canadian dollars 
consequently  western waffles profits can be impacted by fluctuations in the value of canadian dollars relative to us dollars 
we expect to use various types of currency hedges to reduce the economic impact of currency fluctuations 
outlook we believe the opportunities in the private label  value brand  and foodservice areas are favorable for long term growth 
in the past few years  we have taken substantial steps to reshape the company  reducing our reliance on any one business segment while achieving sufficient scale in the categories in which we operate 
we expect to continue to improve our business mix through volume and profit growth of existing businesses  as well as through acquisitions or alliances 
we will continue to explore those acquisition opportunities that strategically fit with our intention to be the premier provider of value oriented food products  such as the recent acquisitions of medallion foods and western waffles 
the following paragraphs discuss significant trends that we believe will impact our results across all segments 
based on preliminary results of operations for the first two months of fiscal  we expect continued cost increases especially fuel  transportation and energy across all segments will negatively impact results for the year with most of the impact occurring in the first two quarters 
the effects of our efforts to reduce costs and increase prices will not be fully realized until the second half of fiscal consequently  our total segment profit contribution is expected to be lower in the first quarter  and could be lower in the second quarter  compared to the previous year 
in  we commenced the systematic conversion of disparate division and facility information systems to new  integrated company wide information systems software provided primarily by jdedwards peoplesoft oracle 
these conversions began in september with two snack nut facilities and continued with the april conversions of corporate headquarters and ralston foods and the july conversion of bremner 
future conversions are expected to continue through fiscal and into fiscal during fiscal  we will focus on improving business processes and system utilization at converted locations and prepare to transfer carriage house to the new system 
the project expenses are expected to decline in fiscal to less than half of the fiscal total 
consolidated information systems expenses are expected to decline slightly in as lower costs of conversions are partially offset by higher depreciation amortization of new hardware and software development costs 
ultimately  the conversion to one system is expected to improve information systems costs and functionality 
ralston foods  bremner  and other divisions periodically enter into co manufacturing agreements with manufacturers of branded products 
terms of these agreements vary but are generally relatively short periods of time less than two years 
volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the product s life cycle  product promotions  alternative production capacity and other factors  none of which are under our direct control 
for the first quarter of fiscal  we expect sales under co manufacturing agreements to decline compared to the prior year  but the impact on earnings before taxes for that period is estimated to be less than million 
freight costs have been increasing and are expected to remain at elevated levels in fiscal  thereby putting pressure on profit margins 
these cost increases are primarily the result of rising fuel prices 
further  a shortage of available common carriers in some areas is putting additional upward pressure on freight rates as well as having a negative effect on our customer service and sales 
in fiscal  freight costs were approximately percent of our cost of products sold  for fiscal  the percentage rose to percent 
in addition  the cost of energy eg  natural gas and certain petroleum based packaging have also increased significantly 
the effects of rising costs on our past results of operations have been mitigated to some extent through hedging and forward purchase contracts  as well as volume and selling price increases 
we expect that similar mitigation efforts and continued cost reduction efforts will reduce the impact of the anticipated increases  however  these efforts are not likely to be fully effective until the second half of fiscal in july  the food and drug administration issued a final rule amending its regulations on nutrition labeling to require that trans fat be declared in the nutrition label of conventional foods and dietary supplements on a separate line immediately under the line for the declaration of saturated fat 
the new rule will be effective january  because of this regulatory change  we have incurred additional costs related to packaging modifications and formulation changes to certain products 
we estimate that such changes to labels and formulas added approximately million to fiscal expense  primarily in the bremner division 
the future impact of this regulation upon our businesses is not expected to be significant 
in  the government passed the sarbanes oxley act the act which requires  under section of the act  a management certification on internal controls over financial reporting 
this increased requirement was effective for ralcorp in fiscal we estimate the incremental out of pocket costs of compliance with section of the act were approximately million for  and we expect fiscal costs associated with the act will decline only slightly from the fiscal levels 
as a result of the american jobs creation act of  the company will receive an additional domestic production activities deduction commencing in fiscal the effect of this additional deduction will be to reduce our federal tax rate by percent in fiscal  progressing to a total reduction of percent for fiscal and beyond  pending further tax law changes 
our blended state and federal effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes and equity earnings for fiscal was including the effects of favorable resolutions of uncertain tax positions  but excluding those effects 
as a result of the domestic production activities deduction  we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal will be approximately 
the following sections contain discussions of the specific factors affecting the outlook for each of our reportable segments 
cereals  crackers cookies the level of competition in the cereal category continues to be intense for our ralston foods division 
competition comes from branded box cereal manufacturers  branded bagged cereal producers and other private label cereal providers  as well as from alternative breakfast food items 
for the last several years  category growth in ready to eat and hot cereals has been minimal or has declined  which has exacerbated its competitive nature 
when branded competitors focus on price promotion  the environment for private label producers becomes more challenging 
we must maintain an effective price gap between our quality private label cereal products and those of branded cereal producers  thereby providing the best value alternative for the consumer 
pricing and volume agreements with customers are generally determined by the customers periodic requests for competitive category reviews in each of our divisions 
during the last twelve months  ralston foods participated in several of these category reviews and was able to maintain or grow volumes  albeit at reduced margin levels 
ralston foods expects additional category reviews will occur in fiscal in this environment  it is imperative that volume gains substantially offset the continued pricing pressures 
our cracker and cookie operation  bremner  also conducts business in a highly competitive category and faces many of the same challenges 
major branded competitors continue to market and promote their offerings aggressively and many smaller  regional branded and private label manufacturers provide additional competitive pressures 
recently  there has been minimal growth in the cookie and cracker categories  intensifying the competition 
bremner s ability to maintain a sufficient price gap between products of branded producers and bremner s quality private label emulations will be important to its results of operations 
in fiscal  bremner will attempt to improve results by moving the production of store brand cookies to a new cookie plant 
in addition  bremner will continue to focus on cost containment  new products  and volume growth of existing products in order to improve operating results 
dressings  syrups  jellies sauces carriage house s competitors  both large and small  continue to be aggressive on pricing 
in addition  the division continues to be negatively affected by the previously mentioned cost increases 
as warranted  we will continue to seek price increases to help offset these rising costs 
to further mitigate the impact of the cost increases  the segment has undertaken restructuring projects  including the sales of underperforming operations and related plant closures  as well as ongoing process improvement and overhead reduction projects 
in light of the segment s thin profit margins  ongoing cost reduction efforts are critical to maintaining segment profitability during periods of rising costs 
snack nuts candy snack nuts and candy continue to be very competitive categories 
this segment of ralcorp faces significant competition from branded manufacturers and  to a lesser extent  from private label and regional producers 
we expect competition to intensify in the future as the snack nut category growth has slowed or declined compared with growth reported in fiscal the majority of the segment s cost of products sold relates to commodities including peanuts  cashews  and tree nuts such as macadamias  pecans  and almonds 
the costs of these commodities fluctuate  sometimes drastically  based upon worldwide supply and demand 
these commodity fluctuations  when not accompanied by pricing changes due to competition  can result in short term changes in the profitability of the segment 
we currently have committed contracts for a large portion of our commodity needs for the first half of fiscal during that period  we expect our peanut and cashew costs to remain relatively constant while our tree nut costs are expected to increase considerably compared to the corresponding period of fiscal whenever possible  we will continue to implement price increases to help offset these rising costs  however  such increases are likely to negatively impact volume 
the segment initiated staffing reductions at several locations during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and consolidated certain administrative functions with the bremner cracker and cookie operations during fiscal in addition to ongoing cost reduction efforts  the segment will continue to focus on maintaining and expanding its customer base  developing new products  and maintaining product quality 
frozen bakery products as previously mentioned  the frozen bakery products segment consists of bakery chef  the isb group  and effective november  the western waffles acquisition 
for frozen bakery products to grow  we must provide high quality products  excellent customer service  superior product innovation  and competitive pricing to our customers 
new product offerings  new foodservice and retail customers  and growth of existing customers will all be important to the future success of this segment 
during fiscal  the isb group s frozen cookie business completed the consolidation of lofthouse and cascade into a single operating facility in ogden  ut 
the february addition of cb  a producer of par baked frozen breads  provides the segment with an expanded product line for sale in both isb and foodservice channels 
the segment plans to expand capacity in its frozen artisan bread business to capitalize on the continued growth of this category 
western waffles  the newest addition to the segment  is a canadian operation which produces primarily private label toaster waffles and other griddle products for primarily us retailers and foodservice customers 
the segment s focus for fiscal is to capitalize on the coordination of bakery chef  the isb business  and western waffles by offering an expanded product grouping to the combined customer base of the three organizations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion is presented pursuant to the united states securities and exchange commission s financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
the policies below are both important to the representation of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
those estimates form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue is recognized when title of goods is transferred to the customer  as specified by the shipping terms 
products are generally sold with no right of return except in the case of goods which do not meet product specifications or are damaged 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive offerings based upon each customer s redemption history 
should a greater proportion of customers redeem incentives than estimated  additional reductions to revenue may be required 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for obsolete product and packaging materials 
the estimated allowance is based on a review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we review long lived assets  including leasehold improvements and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
we conduct a goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the goodwill impairment tests require us to estimate the fair value of our businesses and certain assets and liabilities  for which we utilize valuation techniques such as ebitda multiples and discounted cash flows based on projections 
in our recent tests  we assumed ebitda multiples in the range of to and discount rates in the range of to 
pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the estimated market related value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  discount rates  and future salary increases  and other assumptions inherent in these valuations 
we annually review the assumptions underlying the actuarial calculations and makes changes to these assumptions  based on current market conditions and historical trends  as necessary 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense or income ultimately recognized 
the other postretirement benefits liability is also determined on an actuarial basis and is affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in healthcare costs 
changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected healthcare costs will affect the recorded amount of other postretirement benefits expense 
see note for more information about pension and other postretirement benefit assumptions 
liabilities for workers compensation claims and accrued healthcare costs including a reserve for claims incurred but not yet reported are estimated based on details of current claims  historical experience  and expected trends determined on an actuarial basis 
we estimate income tax expense based on taxes in each jurisdiction  including effective november  canada 
we estimate current tax exposures together with temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we believe that sufficient income will be generated in the future to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
we are subject to periodic audits by governmental tax authorities of our income tax returns

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to commodity price risks relating to the acquisition of raw materials 
ralcorp utilizes derivative financial instruments  including futures contracts  options and swaps  to manage certain of these exposures when it is practical to do so 
as of september   the company had no material open derivative contracts  so market risk associated with its commodity related derivatives portfolio was immaterial 
as of september   a hypothetical adverse change in the market price of the company s principal commodities  including corn  oats  wheat and soybean oil  would have decreased the fair value of the company s commodity related derivatives portfolio by approximately million 
this volatility analysis ignores changes in the exposures inherent in the underlying hedged transactions 
because the company does not hold or trade derivatives for speculation or profit  all changes in derivative values are effectively offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures 
for more information  see note and note to the financial statements included in item interest rate risk the company has interest rate risk related to its debt 
changes in interest rates impact fixed and variable rate debt differently 
for fixed rate debt  a change in interest rates will only impact the fair value of the debt  whereas a change in the interest rates on variable rate debt will impact interest expense and cash flows 
at september   ralcorp s financing arrangements included million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt 
however  in december  million of the variable rate debt  which matures in may  was effectively fixed at through december with an interest rate swap contract 
as of september  and  the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt was approximately equal to its carrying value  based on the discounted amount of future cash flows using ralcorp s incremental rate of borrowing for similar debt 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million 
with respect to variable rate debt  including the effect of the swap in fiscal  a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the company s reported net earnings or cash flows in fiscal or the fair value of the interest rate swap contract was million at september  a hypothetical decrease in expected future interest rates would reduce that fair value by million
