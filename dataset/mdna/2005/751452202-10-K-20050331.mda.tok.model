overview we are a fully integrated  self administered  publicly traded reit which owns  develops  acquires  manages and leases community shopping centers  single tenant retail properties and one regional mall  in the midwestern  southeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
at december   our portfolio consisted of shopping centers  of which thirteen are power centers and two are single tenant retail properties  as well as one enclosed regional mall  totaling approximately million square feet of gross leasable area 
our corporate strategy is to maximize total return for our shareholders by improving operating income and enhancing asset value 
we pursue our goal through a proactive approach to redeveloping  renovating and expanding our shopping centers  the acquisition of community shopping centers  with a focus on grocery and nationally recognized discount department store anchor tenants  the development of new shopping centers in metropolitan markets where we believe demand for a center exists  and a proactive approach to leasing vacant spaces and entering into new leases for occupied spaces when leases are about to expire 
we have followed a disciplined approach to managing our operations by focusing primarily on enhancing the value of our existing portfolio through strategic sales and successful leasing efforts and by improving our capital structure through the refinancing of a portion of our variable rate debt with long term fixed rate debt and one preferred stock offering 
we continue to selectively pursue new acquisitions and development opportunities 
the highlights of our activity reflect this strategy we acquired eight properties at an aggregate cost of million 
we commenced six redevelopment projects of core assets including the expansion of the kroger supermarket at our livonia plaza in livonia  michigan  the expansion of wal mart at northwest crossing in knoxville  tennessee from  square feet to a  square foot supercenter  and the sale of a portion of our cox creek plaza shopping center in florence  alabama to home depot to facilitate their tenancy in this center 
in june  we commenced construction of the  square foot gaines marketplace in gaines township  michigan 
in december  we acquired useable acres of land in jacksonville  florida that will enable us to develop a million square foot shopping center 
in december  we entered into a joint venture agreement with the clarion lion properties fund  a private equity real estate fund advised by ing clarion partners  for the purpose of acquiring million of stable  well located community shopping centers in michigan  north carolina  south carolina  georgia and florida 
we and clarion lion properties fund have committed to contribute 
table of contents equity capital of million and million  respectively  to the entity 
as of december   the entity had acquired three centers for a total purchase price of million 
the strength of our portfolio combined with acquisitions brought into operation since january  allowed us to increase our total revenue by in during  we opened new non anchor stores  at an average base rent of per square foot 
we also renewed non anchor leases  at an average base rent of per square foot representing an increase of over prior rental rates 
in addition  we signed new anchor leases during our occupancy for our portfolio was as of december  we amended our secured revolving credit facility with bank of america increasing the facility from million to million and providing us with an option to increase our borrowings by as much as million  for a total of million in available credit 
we also reset the interest rate on the facility which now bears interest at a rate of london interbank offered rate libor plus to compared to the previous rate of libor plus to 
we also reset the interest rate on our unsecured credit facility which now bears interest at a rate of libor plus to compared to the previous rate of libor plus to 
in june  we issued  series c cumulative convertible preferred shares in a public offering  resulting in approximately million of net proceeds 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
it is our opinion that we fully disclose our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
consistent with our disclosure policies  we include the following discussion related to what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgment reserve for bad debts we provide for bad debt expense based upon the reserve method of accounting 
we continuously monitor the collectibility of our accounts receivable billed  unbilled and straight line from specific tenants  analyze historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in tenant payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
when tenants are in bankruptcy  we make estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims 
the ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year 
management believes the allowance is adequate to absorb currently estimated bad debts 
however  if we experience bad debts in excess of the reserves we have established  our operating income would be reduced 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets we periodically review whether events and circumstances subsequent to the acquisition or development of long term assets  or intangible assets subject to amortization  have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of those assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of those assets may not be recoverable 
if events and circumstances indicate that the long lived assets should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows  on a non discounted basis  for the related assets are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of those assets to determine if a write down is appropriate 
if we identify impairment  we will report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of an impaired asset exceeds its fair value as determined by valuation techniques appropriate in the circumstances 

table of contents in determining the estimated useful lives of intangibles assets with finite lives  we consider the nature  life cycle position  and historical and expected future operating cash flows of each asset  as well as our commitment to support these assets through continued investment 
during  we recognized an impairment loss of million related to our investment in plc novi west development 
this investment was accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
there were no impairment charges for the years ended december  or see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition shopping center space is generally leased to retail tenants under leases which are accounted for as operating leases 
we recognize minimum rents using the straight line method over the terms of the leases commencing when the tenant takes possession of the space 
certain of the leases also provide for additional revenue based on contingent percentage income which is recorded on an accrual basis once the specified target that triggers this type of income is achieved 
the leases also typically provide for tenant recoveries of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other operating expenses 
these recoveries are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable costs are incurred 
revenues from fees and management income are recognized in the period in which the services occur 
lease termination fees are recognized when a lease termination agreement is executed by the parties 
off balance sheet arrangements we have six off balance sheet investments in which we own or less of the total ownership interests 
we provide leasing  development and property management services to the joint ventures 
these investments are accounted for by the equity method 
our level of control of these joint ventures is such that we are not required to include them as consolidated subsidiaries

financing activities the acquisitions  developments and redevelopments  including expansion and renovation programs  that we made during generally were financed though cash provided from operating activities  revolving credit facilities  refinancing mortgages  a construction loan  assumption of five mortgages as a result of acquisitions and an equity offering 
total debt outstanding was approximately million at december  as compared to million at december  in  the increase in our debt was due primarily to the funding of acquisitions  development and expansion activity 
in june  we issued  series c cumulative convertible preferred shares in a public offering 
we used the net proceeds of approximately million to initially pay down outstanding balances under our secured revolving credit facilities and to fund acquisitions and development projects as well as expand or renovate existing shopping centers 
in connection with the acquisitions of five properties in  we assumed fixed rate mortgages amounting to million with interest rates ranging from to 
these mortgages are due beginning in through during  we entered into two fixed rate mortgage loans amounting to million  secured by two properties  and repaid two floating rate mortgages totaling million 
these mortgage notes payable bear interest at and are due may liquidity and capital resources our capital structure at december   includes property specific mortgages  our unsecured revolving credit facility  our secured revolving credit facility  our series b preferred shares  our series c preferred shares  our common shares and a minority interest in the operating partnership 
the principal uses of our liquidity and capital resources are for operations  acquisitions  developments  redevelopments  including expansion and renovation programs  and debt repayment  as well as dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements 
we anticipate that cash on hand  borrowings under our existing credit facilities  as well as other debt and additional equity offerings  will provide the necessary capital to achieve continued growth 

table of contents the following is a summary of our cash flow activities dollars in thousands year ended december  cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities to maintain our qualification as a reit under the code  we are required to distribute to our shareholders at least of our real estate investment trust taxable income as defined in the code

using basis points over libor at december   the effective interest rate on our secured revolving credit facility was  including the effect of interest rate swap agreements

using basis points over libor at december   the effective interest rate on our unsecured revolving credit facility was 
this credit facility is due december outstanding letters of credit issued under the secured revolving credit facility total approximately million 
at december   we also had other letters of credit outstanding of approximating million 
under terms of various debt agreements  we may be required to maintain interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rate on our floating rate debt 
we have interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million at december  based on rates in effect at december   the agreements for notional amounts aggregating million provide for fixed rates ranging from to and expire in december after taking into account the impact of converting our variable rate debt into fixed rate debt by use of the interest rate swap agreements  at december   our variable rate debt accounted for approximately million of outstanding debt with a weighted average interest rate of 
variable rate debt accounted for approximately of our total debt and of our total capitalization 
the properties in which operating partnership owns an interest and which are accounted for by the equity method of accounting are subject to non recourse mortgage indebtedness

table of contents the mortgage loans other than our secured revolving credit facility encumbering our properties  including properties held by our unconsolidated joint ventures  except the bridge loan discussed above  are non recourse  subject to certain exceptions for which we would be liable for any resulting losses incurred by the lender 
these exceptions vary from loan to loan  but generally include fraud or a material misrepresentation  misstatement or omission by the borrower  intentional or grossly negligent conduct by the borrower that harms the property or results in a loss to the lender  filing of bankruptcy petition by the borrower  either voluntary or involuntary  and certain environmental liabilities 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain of these events  such as fraud or filing of a bankruptcy petition by the borrower  we would be liable for the entire outstanding balance of the loan  all interest accrued thereon and certain other costs  penalties and expenses 
we anticipate that the combination of the availability under our two credit facilities  possible equity offerings  the sale of existing properties  and potential new debt will satisfy our expected working capital requirements through at least the next months 
we anticipate adequate liquidity for the foreseeable future to fund future developments  expansions  repositioning  and to continue currently planned capital programs  debt maturities and to make distributions to our shareholders in accordance with the code s requirements applicable to reits 
although we believe that the combination of factors discussed above will provide sufficient liquidity  no such assurance can be given

see our definitive proxy statement to be filed with the sec within days after the year covered by this annual report for a discussion of these agreements

capitalization our capital structure at december  includes property specific mortgages  our unsecured revolving credit facility  our secured revolving credit facility  our series b preferred shares  our series c preferred shares  our common shares and the minority interest in the operating partnership 
at december   the minority interest in the operating partnership represented a ownership in the operating partnership which  may under certain conditions  be exchanged for an aggregate of  common shares 
as of december   the units in the operating partnership op units were exchangeable for our common shares on a one for one basis 
we  as sole general partner of the operating partnership  have the option  but not the obligation  to settle exchanged op units held by others in cash based on the current trading price of our common shares 
assuming the exchange of all op units  there would have been  of our common shares outstanding at december   with a market value of approximately million based on the closing price of per share on december  
as part of our business plan to improve our capital structure and reduce debt  we will continue to pursue the strategy of selling fully valued properties and to dispose of shopping centers that no longer meet the criteria established for our portfolio 
our ability to obtain acceptable selling prices and satisfactory terms will 
table of contents impact the timing of future sales 
net proceeds from the sale of properties are expected to reduce outstanding debt and to fund any future acquisitions 
economic conditions the retail industry has experienced some financial difficulties during the past few years and certain local  regional and national retailers have filed for protection under bankruptcy laws 
if this trend should continue and affect tenants in our portfolio  our future earnings performance could be negatively impacted 
risks related to our business adverse market conditions and tenant bankruptcies could adversely affect our revenues 
the economic performance and value of our real estate assets are subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate  including risks related to adverse changes in national  regional and local economic and market conditions 
our current properties are located in states in the midwestern  southeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
the economic condition of each of our markets may be dependent on one or more industries 
an economic downturn in one of these industries may result in a business downturn for our tenants  and as a result  these tenants may fail to make rental payments  decline to extend leases upon expiration  delay lease commencements or declare bankruptcy 
any tenant bankruptcies  leasing delays  or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant s lease  causing material losses to us and adversely impacting our operating results 
if our properties do not generate sufficient income to meet our operating expenses  including future debt service  our income and results of operations would be adversely affected 
kmart corporation filed for chapter bankruptcy protection during january in june  kmart corporation assigned its lease at our tel twelve shopping center to meijer  inc  a discount department and grocery store retailer 
any bankruptcy filings by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre bankruptcy debts from that tenant  the lease guarantor or their property  unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court 
a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums 
if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy  all pre bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full 
however  if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy  we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages 
any unsecured claim we hold may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims 
it is possible that we may recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold  if at all  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
if any of our anchor tenants becomes insolvent  suffers a downturn in business  or decides not to renew its lease or vacates a property and prevents us from re letting that property by continuing to pay rent for the balance of the term  it may adversely impact our business 
in addition  a lease termination by an anchor tenant or a failure of an anchor tenant to occupy the premises could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by some of our non anchor tenants in the same shopping center pursuant to the terms of their leases 
in that event  we may be unable to re let the vacated space 
similarly  the leases of some anchor tenants may permit them to transfer their leases to other retailers 
the transfer to a new anchor tenant could cause customer traffic in the retail center to decrease  which would reduce the income generated by that retail center 
in addition  a transfer of a lease to a new anchor tenant could also give other tenants the right to make reduced rental payments or to terminate their leases with us 
concentration of our credit risk could reduce our operating results 
several of our tenants represent a significant portion of our leasing revenues 
as of december   we received of our annualized rent from wal mart stores  inc five other tenants each represented at least of our total annualized base rent 
the concentration in our leasing revenue from a small number of 
table of contents tenants creates the risk that  should these tenants experience financial difficulties  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our failure to qualify as a reit would result in higher taxes and reduced cash available for our shareholders 
we believe that we currently operate in a manner so as to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
our continued qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset  income  investment  organizational  distribution  shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis 
our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market values of our assets  some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination  and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals 
our compliance with the reit income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to manage successfully the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis 
moreover  the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances  which could affect the application of the reit qualification requirements 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the irs will not contend that our interests in subsidiaries or other issuers constitute a violation of the reit requirements 
moreover  future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 
if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates  and distributions to shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income 
any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders  which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of  and trading prices for  our shares 
unless entitled to relief under certain code provisions  we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a reit 
reit distribution requirements limit our available cash 
as a reit  we are subject to annual distribution requirements  which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes  including amounts to fund our growth 
we generally must distribute annually at least of our net reit taxable income  excluding any net capital gain  in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax 
we intend to make distributions to our shareholders to comply with the requirements of the code 
however  differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short term or long term basis to meet the distribution requirement of the code 
legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us 
the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the united states treasury department 
changes to tax laws  which may have retroactive application  could adversely affect our shareholders or us 
we cannot predict how changes in tax laws might affect our shareholders or us 
a reduction  in  in the maximum tax rate applicable to dividends may make reit investments less attractive 
tax legislation enacted in reduced through the maximum tax rate for dividends payable to individuals from to 
dividends payable by reits generally are not eligible for the reduced rates 
although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends paid by reits  the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the capital stocks of non reit corporations that pay dividends  which could adversely affect the value of the capital stock of reits  including our common shares 
in addition  the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely 
table of contents affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends  which could negatively affect the value of our real estate assets 
our inability to successfully identify or complete suitable acquisitions and new developments would adversely affect our results of operations 
integral to our business strategy is our ability to continue to acquire and develop properties 
we also may not be successful in identifying suitable real estate properties that meet our acquisition criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms 
we may not be successful in identifying suitable areas for new development  negotiating for the acquisition of the land  obtaining required permits and authorizations  completing developments in accordance with our budgets and on a timely basis or leasing any newly developed space 
if we fail to identify or complete suitable acquisitions or developments within our budget  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our growth could slow  which in turn could adversely impact our share price 
our redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
a key component of our business strategy is exploring redevelopment opportunities at existing properties within our portfolio and in connection with property acquisitions 
to the extent that we engage in these redevelopment activities  they will be subject to the risks normally associated with these projects  including  among others  cost overruns and timing delays as a result of the lack of availability of materials and labor  weather conditions and other factors outside of our control 
any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these redevelopment projects and adversely impact our operating results 
we have identified a material weakness in our internal controls which  if not appropriately remediated  could affect our ability to ensure timely and reliable financial reports and which could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities 
in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we identified a matter that we consider to be a material weakness in our internal controls with respect to our accounting for annual employee bonus compensation 
we have advised the audit committee of our board of trustees and our independent registered public accounting firm  deloitte touche llp  that errors had been made with respect to our accounting for bonus compensation expense during the years ended december  and and the first  second and third quarters of  and that such errors had not been detected by our internal controls 
as a result of the errors  the financial results for each of these periods have been restated from the amounts previously reported 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a material weakness is a significant deficiency as defined in public company accounting oversight board united states  or pcaob  auditing standard no 
 or a combination of significant deficiencies  that results in there being more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions 
we believe that the material weakness referred to above resulted primarily from the design of our controls related to accrued liability for employee bonus compensation 
we have begun to take steps toward remediating the material weakness described above  including i the implementation of periodic review and assessment of the accrued liability for employee bonus compensation expense by our corporate human resources department  ii the development and maintenance of more formal accounting procedures and policies and iii the strengthening of existing controls over significant accounting estimates 
while we believe the actions we have taken and plan to take will correct the identified material weakness in our internal controls  if these actions are not successful it could adversely affect our ability to report financial results on a timely and accurate basis  as well as our ability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective and the ability of our independent registered public accounting firm to deliver an unqualified report  or any report  on our internal controls 
inferior internal 
table of contents controls could cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our reported financial information  which could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities 
funds from operations we consider funds from operations  also known as ffo  an appropriate supplemental measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
under the nareit definition  ffo represents income before minority interest  excluding extraordinary items  as defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  gains and losses on sales of depreciable property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to gaap net income as an indication of our performance 
we consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance between periods or to compare our performance to different reits 
however  our computation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other real estate companies  and therefore  may not be comparable to these other real estate companies 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate investments  which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions and many companies utilize different depreciable lives and methods 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from depreciable property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  acquisition and development activities and interest costs  which provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with gaap 
in addition  ffo does not include the cost of capital improvements  including capitalized interest 
for the reasons described above  we believe that ffo provides us and our investors with an important indicator of our operating performance 
this measure of performance is used by us for several business purposes and for reits it provides a recognized measure of performance for reits other than gaap net income  which may include significant non cash items 
other real estate companies may calculate ffo in a different manner 
we recognize ffo s limitations when compared to gaap s net income 
ffo does not represent amounts available for needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
we do not use ffo as an indicator of our cash obligations and funding requirement for future commitments  acquisition or development activities 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs  including the payment of dividends 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income computed in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is simply used as an additional indicator of our operating performance 

table of contents the following table illustrates the calculations of ffo in thousands  except per share data years ended december  net income add depreciation and amortization expense loss on sale of depreciable property minority interest in partnership continuing operations discontinued operations less discontinued operations  gain on sale of property  net of minority interest funds from operations less preferred stock dividends funds from operations available to common shareholders weighted average equivalent shares outstanding  diluted funds from operations available for common shareholders  per diluted share inflation inflation has been relatively low in recent years and has not had a significant detrimental impact on our results of our operation 
should inflation rates increase in the future  substantially all of our tenant leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the negative impact of inflation 
such lease provisions include clauses that require our tenants to reimburse us for real estate taxes and many of the operating expenses we incur 
also  many of our leases provide for periodic increases in base rent which are either of a fixed amount or based on changes in the consumer price index and or percentage rents where the tenant pays us rent based on a percentage of its sales 
we believe that any inflationary increases in our expenses should be substantially offset by increased expense reimbursements  contractual rent increases and or increased receipts from percentage rents 
therefore  we expect the effects of inflation and other changes in prices would not have a material impact on the results of our operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets sfas 
this statement amends accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions apb no 
which established the requirement that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in apb no 
 however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas amends apb no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  sfas is not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all shares based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized 
table of contents in the consolidated statement of income based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure  as was allowed under apb no 
 will no longer be an alternative 
the impact of adopting sfas r cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as it will depend on the market value and the amount of share based awards granted in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt obligations 
we are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk  or other material rate or price risks 
based on our debt and interest rates and the interest rate swap agreements in effect at december   a basis point change in interest rates would affect our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately  we believe that a base point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our total outstanding debt 
under terms of various debt agreements  we may be required to maintain interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rate on our floating rate debt 
we have interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million at december  based on rates in effect at december   the agreements for notional amounts aggregating million provide for fixed rates ranging from to and expire in december the following table sets forth information as of december  concerning our long term debt obligations  including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates of maturing amounts and fair market value 
fair thereafter total value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate we estimated the fair value of our fixed rate mortgages using a discounted cash flow analysis  based on our incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements with the same remaining maturity 
considerable judgment is required to develop estimated fair values of financial instruments 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt is greater than the carrying amount  however  settlement at the reported fair value may not be possible or may not be a prudent management decision 
the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we could realize on disposition of the financial instruments
