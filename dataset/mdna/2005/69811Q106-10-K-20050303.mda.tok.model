item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview vitex is a development stage biotechnology company developing novel anti infective products 
our inactine pathogen reduction system for red cells  or inactine system  is designed to inactivate a wide range of viruses  bacteria  parasites and lymphocytes from red blood cells and to remove soluble prion proteins 
prion proteins in their pathogenic forms are the agents that cause mad cow disease  or in humans  variant creutzfeldt jakob disease  or vcjd  which is fatal  and for which no diagnostic test or therapy currently exists 
over million red cell units are transfused annually in north america  europe and japan  making it one of the most frequently prescribed and important products in medicine 
a pathogen reduction product for both acute and chronic patients could represent  according to our estimates as based on a report prepared for us by easton associates  an outside consultant  a billion market with acute indications representing approximately billion out of that total 
we currently do not have any fda approved products and have not made any commercial sales of our products under development 
in november  we suspended enrollment in our phase iii surgical  or acute  study for our lead product candidate  the inactine red cell system  following identification of an immune response to inactine treated red cells in one patient in the study during ongoing immunologic testing of subjects enrolled in the trial 
as a result  both the phase iii trial of inactine for acute indications and the phase iii trial of inactine for chronic indications  described in more detail below  have been halted  in the case of the chronic trial  following a clinical hold by the fda 
although no clinical consequences of the immune response are apparent based on review of available data  additional patients will not be enrolled in the acute trial pending full evaluation 
we have notified the fda that we have suspended enrollment in the study and that we intend to continue discussions with the fda regarding the conditions  if any  under which the trial might be continued while we are completing our review of all relevant data 
we intend to conduct these discussions as part of an ongoing dialogue with the fda regarding conditions for licensure of the inactine system 
our phase iii chronic study of the inactine system was placed on clinical hold by the fda due to the availability of insufficient safety information  and was subsequently halted by us following a review by an independent data safety monitoring committee  or dsmc  in november the halting of the study by us was due to antibody formation in sickle cell anemia patients receiving repeat transfusions of inactine treated red cells 
the phase iii trial of inactine for chronic indications was designed to be conducted in two sequential parts  part a and part b 
the purpose of part a was to allow assessment of the safety of inactine treated red cells in the patient population under study prior to proceeding to part b 
enrollment in the chronic trial was 
table of contents stopped prior to initiation of part b on the recommendation of the dsmc  which was charged with reviewing the data from part a of the study following the fda s clinical hold on the trial due to availability of insufficient safety information 
prior to the suspension of the surgical trial  the fda had expressed concerns regarding the licensing of the current inactine system for an acute indication in light of the presence of antibodies observed in the chronic trial  and has requested justification from us for pursuit of an acute only indication in the context of these findings 
the fda has also indicated that a control system with respect to an acute only indication would be required to ensure that patients who have previously received red cells treated by the current inactine system do not receive inactine red cells in subsequent hospitalizations 
we have met with the fda and presented proposals on supplemental clinical trials 
however  the fda has indicated that it will require the review of additional data  including the results of the phase iii trial for inactine in acute indications  before fully responding to our proposals for additional clinical trials 
the occurrence of an immune response in the acute trial and the decision to suspend enrollment in it will require us to formulate and present to the fda a regulatory plan for approval of inactine that takes into account all findings to date  which is likely to significantly delay determination of any acceptable regulatory pathway 
the fda has indicated that any such regulatory plan for the acute only indication must address the development of a control system  as described above 
in addition  we believe that modifications to the current inactine process that are designed to reduce the likelihood of an immunologic response to treated red cells will also be required 
at this time  we cannot determine the length of time required for us to develop such a regulatory plan  nor can we estimate the length of time required for the fda to approve such a plan  or whether such a plan will be approved at all 
enrollment in the acute trial will continue to be suspended until such time as a regulatory plan is approved by the fda and implemented by us  if ever 
we have begun preclinical testing on the modifications to the current inactine process that are designed to reduce the likelihood of an immunologic response to treated red cells 
however  this work is preliminary and no assurance can be given that we will be able to develop a control system that will be technically feasible  approved by the fda  and economically viable  or that the modifications to the current inactine process will succeed in reducing the likelihood of an immunologic response 
prior to the suspension of enrollment in the acute study  the fda also directed us to implement additional patient safety monitoring procedures in the phase iii acute trial 
we implemented these procedures and  until enrollment into the trial was suspended  were periodically updating the fda on the trial data 
while we believe that the steps taken addressed the fda s recommendations prior to suspending enrollment in the acute trial  further steps could be required by the fda 
we also received from the fda a written request for further information relating to an august amendment to our ind 
the amendment included responses to questions raised by the fda relating to procedures for patient safety monitoring used in the phase iii chronic study  which had been placed on clinical hold by the fda due to the availability of insufficient safety information  and subsequently halted by us following a dsmc review 
we have responded to the fda s request and are awaiting further communications from the agency on this matter 
our ongoing development plan for inactine for chronic  acute or other indications is highly uncertain  with the phase iii trial for inactine in chronic indications halted by us following the clinical hold by the fda and the subsequent review by the dsmc  and enrollment suspended in the phase iii trial for inactine in acute indications 
we cannot ensure that the acute trial will resume or complete enrollment in a timely manner 
the exact nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to bring to market the product resulting from our pathogen inactivation research and development projects involve a number of key variables which are either unpredictable or outside our control  including whether the likelihood of an immune response to inactine treated red cells can be adequately reduced  whether  and under what circumstances  the fda will agree with our plan to proceed with clinical trials  the enrollment rates and results of the phase iii clinical trial  should it be continued  the extent of further studies which could be required for filing a biologics license application with the fda  the length of the fda and foreign regulatory approval processes  the success of our fundraising efforts  our ability to establish and maintain relationships with marketing partners and strategic collaborators  and the timing of commencement of commercialization of our product 
inability to satisfy one or more of these conditions  or to do so in a commercially acceptable manner  may render continued development of our inactine system infeasible 

table of contents the development of the inactine system is our most significant current activity 
with the proposed merger with panacos further described below under recent developments anticipated to close in mid march  our continuing significant activities will include the panacos clinical trials and development work 
we fund our operations primarily through sale of common stock and research and development grants 
as of february   we had cash on hand of approximately million 
we expect to close on a proposed financing with anticipated proceeds of million concurrently with the closing of the proposed merger with panacos 
at present  after our recent restructuring in december  we are consuming approximately million in cash per month 
following the proposed merger  the combined company expects to spend approximately million on average in cash per month in we believe that our present cash resources will be adequate to meet our requirements only through the first quarter of we believe that the sum of our present cash resources  panacos cash resources and the anticipated proceeds of million from the financing will be adequate to meet our requirements  post merger  into the fourth quarter of however  there is no current guarantee that we will able to successfully complete the merger transaction and close on the million financing 
our special meeting of shareholders to vote on the merger and financing is scheduled for march  we expect to commence a rights offering in march  close in april and raise a maximum of million to increase that cash horizon 
however  there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully complete the rights offering 
in the event that the merger  financing  or rights offering are not successful  we intend to delay or reduce expenditures so as to continue our operations on a limited scale and within our available resources 
recent developments proposed merger with panacos pharmaceuticals on june   we signed a definitive merger agreement with panacos pharmaceuticals 
the terms of the proposed merger were subsequently amended in november  december and february we filed a final joint proxy statement prospectus with the securities and exchange commission on february  and anticipate closing the merger shortly after our special meeting of shareholders on march  panacos pharmaceuticals is a development stage company involved in the discovery and development of the next generation of small molecule  antiviral drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus  or hiv  infection and other major virus diseases 
panacos is focusing exclusively on diseases with large markets  where there is a clear unmet need for more effective therapies 
a major commercial advantage of the hiv market is the rapid clinical development and approval process for new drugs 
the total time from initiation of clinical trials to market may be as little as four years  shorter than for many other disease indications 
panacos completed its pre clinical program for its lead candidate to treat hiv  pa  at the end of and filed an ind with the fda in december panacos entered phase i clinical testing of pa in march it has completed the phase i programs and begun the phase ii program 
pa is the first in a new class of drugs called maturation inhibitors discovered by panacos scientists 
the fda has granted fast track status  available for drugs designed to treat a serious or life threatening condition with an unmet medical need  to pa the merger  if completed  would expand vitex into anti infective therapeutics and will add additional pre clinical and clinical drug candidates to our product portfolio 
rights offering we plan to file a registration statement with the sec for a proposed offering of our common stock with a maximum value of approximately million through the distribution of subscription rights to our shareholders in early march under terms of the rights offering our shareholders will receive a certain number of subscription rights for each share of vitex common stock owned at the record date of march  thereby entitling them to purchase shares of our common stock representing a total maximum of million shares  prior to the anticipated reverse split 
our largest shareholder  ampersand ventures  held million shares of 
table of contents vitex common stock as of february   prior to the anticipated reverse split 
ampersand agreed not to participate in the rights offering as a condition to their participation in the million private placement 
the exercise price for the rights will be per share  the same as the price paid for our common stock by great point partners and affiliates in the million private placement  which we expect to close concurrently with the proposed panacos merger in march there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully complete any of these transactions 
critical accounting estimates and policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
our actual results could differ from these estimates 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and the accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include the following research and development revenue and cost recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenues under research collaborations  including grants received from the government and minimum royalty payments  as we incur research costs eligible for reimbursement under the collaboration agreements 
non refundable up front and milestone payments related to license and distribution agreements are deferred and amortized over the period in which the licensee has distribution rights 
we continually review these estimates for any events which could result in a change in the deferral period 
amounts received in advance of the incurrence of reimbursable research expenses are deferred and recognized when the related expenses have been incurred 
research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
long lived assets our long lived assets  which consist primarily of property and equipment  are recorded at cost and amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we generally depreciate property and equipment using the straight line method over their economic life  which ranges from to years 
determining the economic lives of our long lived assets requires us to make significant judgments and estimates  and can materially impact our operating results 
our estimates of the useful lives of these assets are based on industry standards and our specific business 
we believe our estimates are reasonable for all material purposes and that our estimates are not likely to change in the near future 
asset impairments we review the valuation of long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

we are required to assess the recoverability of long lived assets on an interim basis whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant adverse change in our business or industry  and significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period 

table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
 when we determine that the carrying value of applicable long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we evaluate whether the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
if such a circumstance were to exist  we would measure an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the particular long lived asset or group of assets exceeds its fair value 
we would determine the fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
use of different estimates and judgments on any of these factors could yield materially different results in our analysis  and could result in significantly different asset impairment charges 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

under sfas no 
 goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually in lieu of being amortized 
we have selected the fourth quarter as the period to perform the annual test 
furthermore  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
an impairment loss shall be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
impairment losses shall be recognized in operations 
on november   we announced that we had temporarily suspended enrollment in our phase iii surgical  or acute  study for our lead product candidate  the inactine system  following identification of an immune or antibody response to inactine treated red cells in one patient during ongoing immunologic testing of subjects enrolled in the trial 
as a result  both the phase iii trial of inactine for acute indications and the phase iii trial of inactine for chronic indications have been halted 
the phase iii chronic study was placed on clinical hold by the fda due to the availability of insufficient safety information and subsequently halted following the review of an independent data safety monitoring committee 
these developments triggered an impairment review of long lived assets and goodwill under the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 respectively 
based on the results of our review of long lived assets  we wrote off certain core technology acquired in our acquisition of pentose pharmaceuticals  inc the intangible asset had a remaining net book value of million 
the charge was booked in the fourth quarter of to research and development costs 
based on the results of our review for goodwill  which totaled million at december   no impairment charge was indicated as the company s market capitalization exceeded the book value of its net assets 
contingencies contingencies are addressed by assessing the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after reviewing the relevant facts and circumstances  seeking outside professional advice of lawyers or accountants where appropriate  and then making and recording our best judgment of potential loss under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 contingencies 
this process is repeated in each reporting period as circumstances evolve and are reevaluated 
any changes in our assumptions or estimates that impact our estimates of loss will be recorded in operations immediately in the period of the change 
as discussed in item above  we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
after consulting with our attorneys regarding these proceedings  we have recorded our best judgment of potential costs in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents results of operations fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net revenues research funding fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million the increase in research funding is attributed to the recognition in revenue of non refundable up front and milestone payments from amersham pharmacia biotech  which were previously deferred and are being amortized over the life of the related agreement  or approximately ten years 
we terminated the agreement with amersham pharmacia biotech during the fourth quarter of and  as a result  recognized the balance of the unamortized deferred revenue of approximately million 
this agreement covered the development and marketing of inactine for use as a pathogen reduction step in the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals 
we made the decision to terminate the agreement based on the result of joint development efforts suggesting that the chance of material commercial success were relatively low 
further  the development and regulatory process was likely to be lengthy and expensive 
total amersham pharmacia biotech revenue totaled million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year research funding also includes grants received from governmental agencies in the amount of and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect revenues earned from existing government grants to total approximately million in research and development fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million our current research and development activities all relate to the development of pathogen inactivation technologies for blood products of which our inactine chemistry is currently the core technology and our inactine system for red cells is the lead product candidate 
our research and development spending on pathogen inactivation technologies have principally included our internal research efforts  clinical trials conducted by medical institutions and scientific and development work under contract to independent vendors 
we have completed phase i and phase ii clinical trials in human subjects 
in january  we commenced two phase iii trials  a surgical  or acute  study for patients requiring acute transfusions of red blood cells and a chronic study for patients with sickle cell anemia requiring repeat transfusions of red blood cells 
in the fourth quarter of  we halted our phase iii chronic study of inactine red cells due to antibody formation in sickle cell anemia patients 
following this decision to halt our inactine system phase iii chronic clinical trial  we restructured our operations to reduce spending and to concentrate our efforts on the acute trial 
we reduced staffing by over  eliminating over positions  and curtailed non essential activities 
there were no restructuring expenses related to these actions 
in november  we suspended enrollment in our phase iii surgical  or acute  study for our lead product candidate  the inactine red cell system  following identification of an immune response to inactine treated red cells in one patient in the study during ongoing immunologic testing of subjects enrolled in the trial 
following this decision  in december  we announced that we had implemented another restructuring to reduce expenses 
the restructuring was intended to allow us to conserve cash until the completion of the proposed merger with panacos 
the restructuring included an immediate reduction in our research and development workforce by approximately  or positions 
we incurred a charge of million to research and development in the fourth quarter of in connection with this restructuring as each employee subject to the restructuring received severance pay equal to his or her one month salary 
all payments were made prior to december  
table of contents following the decision to halt the chronic trial in november  research and development operations were restructured resulting in a reduction in head count 
a significant portion of the decrease in research and development costs from fiscal year to occurred as a result of that reduction in head count and development activity 
labor costs decreased by million from to and consumption of lab supplies decreased by million 
development spending decreased by million from the prior year due to the reduction in investment in the development of equipment and disposables for use in the inactine system 
spending in this area in included major investments in construction of prototype equipment and disposables for use in the clinical trials for the inactine system 
the work in centered on validation of the equipment and disposables at a much reduced level of investment when compared to research and development spending in fiscal year also included a non cash charge to write off million capitalized build out and other costs of a processing facility which we decided not to place in service see item legal proceedings 
these decreases from the prior year are offset by a non cash charge of million to write off certain core technology after we performed an impairment review on our long lived assets  triggered by the halting of enrollment in the acute phase iii trial during the fourth quarter of also in we recorded a one time non cash charge of million reflecting a cumulative effect of a change in leased property accounting over the past five years that was not material to our reported results in any one year 
the restructuring in lowered our spending rate in december into the range of approximately million per month and decreased research and development costs from a monthly average of million into the range of approximately million per month 
due to the proposed merger with panacos expected to close in mid march  we expect research and development costs to increase to approximately million on a quarterly basis beginning in the second quarter of primarily due to the significant costs of panacos ongoing phase ii clinical trials 
cumulatively  we have invested million in research and development of pathogen inactivation technologies for blood products since  including the cost of in process research and development resulting from our merger with pentose pharmaceuticals  inc general and administrative expenses fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million the majority of the increase from to is due to merger related costs of million for our proposed merger with panacos  the agreement for which was signed in additionally  we established legal contingencies in in the amount of million for pending litigation see item legal proceedings 
we allocate various corporate charges based on certain indicators  including headcount 
a greater proportion of the headcount reduction due to our restructuring in november was in research and development rather than in the general and administrative functions 
primarily as a result of this  allocation of charges to general and administrative expenses increased million from to significant reductions in expense from to include million in investor relations costs and million in general administrative costs as a result of our restructuring in the company reduced the use of outside consultants and took on direct responsibility for these activities 
interest expense income  net fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million fiscal year interest expense reflects a million decrease due to the repayment of advances to pall corporation in fiscal year interest income decreased by million from fiscal year to fiscal year resulting from a lower level of invested cash and cash equivalents during the year 

table of contents provision for income taxes for fiscal years and  we have recorded no income tax expense or benefit 
at december  and december   we established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset positions of million and million  respectively 
realization of these net deferred tax assets will be based on  among other things  our ability to generate future taxable profits and utilize our net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits before they expire 
our ability to utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited if there is a change in ownership  as defined by section of the internal revenue code  in connection with the proposed merger with panacos 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net revenues research funding fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million the decrease in research funding is primarily a result of our august modification of the pall collaboration  under the terms of which we assumed responsibility from pall for funding of the inactine red cell program 
prior to august  research funding received was principally from pall corporation 
also included within research funding is amortized revenue related to non refundable up front and milestone payments from amersham pharmacia biotech  which are amortized over the life of the related agreement 
these amounts totaled million for each of fiscal years and in addition  we recorded minimal royalty payments from amersham pharmacia biotech of million and in fiscal years and  respectively 
finally  research funding includes grants received from governmental agencies in the amount of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
research and development fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million our research and development activities all relate to the development of pathogen inactivation technologies for blood products of which our inactine chemistry is currently the core technology and our inactine system for red cells is the lead product candidate 
the inactine system has completed phase i and phase ii clinical trials in human subjects and  until suspension in november  was in a phase iii trial with patients requiring acute transfusions of red blood cells 
our research and development spending on pathogen inactivation technologies principally includes our internal research efforts  clinical trials conducted by medical institutions and scientific and development work under contract to independent vendors 
fiscal year includes a million non cash charge to write off capitalized build out and other costs of a processing facility which we have decided not to place in service 
in fiscal year  phase iii clinical costs were higher than in the prior year by million as our phase iii trials commenced in january fiscal year includes a non recurring million royalty payment for engineering services on the inactine delivery system 
this payment was required under our agreement for engineering services to maintain exclusivity for the inactine delivery system 
toxicology program costs were million higher in fiscal year than in fiscal year as our inactine system toxicology studies were significantly completed in fiscal year fiscal includes million higher spending than on a prion diagnostic research program which was phased out by the end of this program was terminated to allow to focus 
table of contents ongoing development resources on inactine development efforts 
costs for laboratory supplies decreased by million from fiscal year to as our r d emphasis shifted toward clinical trials and away from pre clinical development and validation of the technology 
in the fourth quarter of  following the decision to halt our inactine system phase iii chronic clinical trial after it was placed on clinical hold by the fda due to the availability of insufficient safety information and review by an independent data safety monitoring committee  we restructured our operations to reduce spending and to concentrate our efforts on the acute trial 
we reduced staffing by over  eliminating over positions  and curtailed non essential activities 
there were no restructuring expenses related to these actions 
general and administrative expenses fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million million million the decrease in general and administrative expenses is due to lower staffing needs  lower discretionary consulting expenditures and lower costs related to the protection of intellectual property 
plasma operations impairment fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million credit million in  we recorded credits on the divestiture of our plasma operations primarily related to the million settlement of an ethanol tax dispute with the us bureau of alcohol  tobacco and firearms  as well as the settlement of certain liabilities below recorded amounts 
interest expense income  net fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease million expense million income million fiscal year net interest expense reflects a million charge on remeasurement to net present value of the million receivable from precision on which payment was rescheduled by one year to december additionally  we had lower average cash balances in fiscal year versus provision for income taxes for fiscal years and  we have recorded no income tax expense or benefit 
at december  and december   we established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset positions of million and million  respectively 
realization of these net deferred tax assets will be based on  among other things  our ability to generate future taxable profits and utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits before they expire 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations primarily through sales of our common stock and research and development grants 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of million  including unrestricted cash of million  in comparison with working capital of million  including unrestricted cash of million at the prior year end 
our cash balances are invested with the primary objectives of safety of principal and liquidity 
our available unrestricted cash balances on february  were approximately million 
we believe that our present cash resources will be adequate to meet our requirements only through the first quarter of 
table of contents we expect to close on a proposed financing with anticipated proceeds of million concurrently with the closing of the proposed panacos merger 
at present  after our recent restructuring in december  we have been consuming approximately million in cash per month 
following the proposed merger  the combined company expects to spend approximately million on average in cash per month during vitex believes that our present cash resources  in addition to panacos cash resources and the anticipated proceeds of the million financing will be adequate to meet our requirements  post merger  into the fourth quarter of however  there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully complete the merger transaction and close on the million financing 
our special meeting of shareholders to vote on the merger and the financing is scheduled for march  we also expect to commence a rights offering in march  close in april and raise a maximum of million to increase that cash horizon 
however  there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully complete the rights offering 
in the event that the merger  financing  or rights offering are not successful  we intend to delay or reduce expenditures so as to continue our operations on a limited scale and within our available resources 
beyond  we anticipate cash requirements of between million and million annually 
the level of cash resources required will depend on the continuing progress of clinical trials for pa  the ongoing investment in the clinical development of the inactine red cell system and the level of investment in any other therapeutic products under development by the company 
we plan to fund operations through a combination of additional sales of vitex stock and debt securities  grants from government agencies  such as the national institutes of health  and partnerships for the clinical development and distribution of products  such as pa development partnerships can include license fees and reimbursement of the cost to conduct clinical trials required to commercialize the product in return for distribution rights following licensing of the product by regulatory authorities 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to close new financings  secure additional grants  or enter into commercial partnerships 
other than grants  proceeds from financings and partnerships  we do not anticipate generating cash flow from operations until the licensing and launch of pa in a major market  such as the us or europe 
in fiscal and  we generated cash primarily from equity transactions and the receipt of partner research funding

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  shared based payment statement r 
statement r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
statement r requires an entity to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement 
the revised statement generally requires that an entity account for those transactions using the fair value based method  and eliminates the intrinsic value method of accounting in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which was permitted under statement no 
 as originally issued 
the revised statement requires entities to disclose information about the nature of the share based payment transactions and the effects of those transactions on the financial statements 
all public companies must use either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective transition method 
the company has not yet evaluated the impact of this pronouncement which must be adopted in the third quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the pro forma effect on our reported net loss and net loss per share of applying the fair value recognition provisions of the previous sfas no 
to stock based employee compensation 
also in december  as part of its short term international convergence project with the international accounting standards board  the fasb issued statement to address the accounting for nonmonetary exchanges of productive assets 
statement amends apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary exchanges  which established a narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets from fair value measurement 
this statement eliminates that exception and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
under statement nonmonetary exchanges are required to be accounted for at fair value  recognizing any gains or losses  if their fair value is determinable within reasonable limits and the transaction has commercial substance 
the statement specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
we plan to adopt this statement in fiscal  and its adoption is not expected to impact our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors our business faces significant risks 
these risks include those described below and may include additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we do not currently believe are material 
these statements relate to future events or the future financial performance of vitex 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimated  predicts  potential  or continue or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology 
these statements only reflect management s expectations and estimates 
actual events or results may differ materially 
in evaluating these statements  you should specifically consider various factors  including the risks outlined below 
the risks described below are the risks that we believe to be the most significant at this time to the combined company post merger of vitex and panacos as the proposed merger is anticipated to close in mid march  these factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statements 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
risks relating to the merger the ability of vitex and panacos to successfully integrate their businesses is uncertain 
after closing the merger  vitex and panacos  each of which previously operated independently  will have to integrate their operations 
the integration will require efforts from each company  including the coordination of their general and administrative functions 
for example  integration of administrative functions includes coordinating employee benefits  payroll  financial reporting  purchasing and disclosure functions 
delays in successfully integrating and managing employee benefits could lead to dissatisfaction and employee turnover 

table of contents problems in integrating purchasing and financial reporting could result in control issues  including unplanned costs 
diversion of management attention could result in delays in clinical programs 
the combination of vitex s and panacos organizations may result in greater competition for resources and elimination of research and development programs that might otherwise be successfully completed 
vitex management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate the two companies  one of which is located in watertown  massachusetts and one of which is located in gaithersburg  maryland 
such diversion of management s attention or difficulties in the transition process could have an adverse impact on vitex 
vitex will have approximately employees and panacos will have approximately employees at the time the merger is closed 
virtually all of the employees in the merged company will work at either the watertown  ma or the gaithersburg  md facility 
the majority of vitex personnel in watertown  ma are scientists  clinical and regulatory professionals  engineers and individuals who process blood for experimental and clinical use 
panacos is principally engaged in the development of innovative drugs to treat hiv and other serious viral diseases 
the vitex workforce in gaithersburg  md formerly the panacos workforce consists largely of scientists  clinical and regulatory professionals 
the companies share a focus in innovative anti infective technologies including extensive knowledge of how to kill or inactivate viruses and other agents such as bacteria that can cause disease in humans 
the management team of the combined company has experience in attracting and retaining the technical personnel that will represent the majority of employees in the combined company 
however  no assurance can be given that the combined company will succeed in its efforts to integrate the vitex and panacos operations successfully 
the transition period is expected to be largely complete within the fiscal quarter following the closing of the merger 
failure to integrate the companies operations successfully could result in delays in the companies clinical trial programs 
vitex and panacos have entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in beneficial synergies  including improved ability to raise new capital through access to new classes of investors focused on public companies engaged in anti infective drug development  shared expertise in developing innovative anti infective technologies and the potential for technology collaboration  a broader pipeline of products  greater ability to attract commercial partners  larger combined commercial opportunities  and a broader portfolio of patents and trademarks 
achieving these anticipated synergies and the potential benefits underlying the two companies reasons for the merger will depend on a number of factors  some of which include retention of scientific staff  significant litigation  if any  adverse to panacos and vitex  including  particularly  product liability litigation and patent and trademark litigation  and the ability of the combined company to continue development of vitex and panacos product candidates 
patent litigation is costly  highly uncertain and can require a significant amount of management time and the time of key technical staff to prosecute or defend 
an adverse patent ruling could affect the ability of the company to successfully develop a product and affect the return on investment with the earlier introduction of competitive products should patent protection be ruled invalid or unenforceable 
litigation associated with a clinical trial could adversely affect the progress of the trial  consume significant resources in defending the claim and negatively affect the successful commercialization of the product 
the consideration to be paid in the merger is 
table of contents based on the expectation of continued clinical and commercial development of the combined company s products  and the associated protection provided by related intellectual property rights 
in addition  significant litigation could impact the ability of the merged company to raise capital to fund the clinical development programs due to the associated cost and uncertainty 
even if the two companies are able to integrate their operations  there can be no assurance that these anticipated synergies will be achieved 
the failure to achieve such synergies could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations and financial condition of the combined company 
the value of the shares of vitex common stock to be received is not fixed and may decline from its current value 
the number of shares of vitex common stock to be issued in the merger is fixed and each stockholder of panacos will receive a fixed number of shares of vitex common stock in exchange for their panacos common stock and preferred stock in the merger 
however  because vitex common stock is publicly traded  the value of a share of vitex common stock may change on a daily basis 
therefore  the value of the shares of vitex common stock each panacos stockholder is to receive in the merger may decline from the value as of the date of the joint proxy statement prospectus for the special meeting of stockholders scheduled for march  vitex s and panacos directors and executive officers have interests that are or in addition to those of other shareholders  which may influence them to support the merger 
the directors and executive officers of vitex and panacos participate in arrangements that provide them with interests in the merger that are in addition to those of other shareholders 
for example  vitex has agreed that  as of the closing of the merger  it will cause dr 
ackerman  the chairman of the board and interim chief executive officer of panacos and the chairman of the board of vitex  to become the chief executive officer of the surviving company 
vitex has also agreed that dr 
herbert h 
hooper  a general partner of ampersand and a current director of panacos  and mr 
eric w 
linsley  a partner with am pappas and also a current director of panacos  will be appointed to the surviving company s board of directors 
further  as a result of the merger  options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of panacos common stock that are held by officers and directors of panacos will immediately vest 
the exercise prices of these options range from to per share of panacos common stock  with a weighted average exercise price of approximately per share 
in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement  these options will convert into options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of vitex common stock and will have exercise prices ranging from to per share  with a weighted average exercise price of per share  immediately following the consummation of the merger 
as a result  you should consider whether these directors and executive officers could be more likely to support approval of the merger than if they did not hold these interests 
vitex has been notified by nasdaq that it is not in compliance with continued listing standards  which may result in a delisting of the common stock if vitex cannot regain compliance 
on september   vitex reported that it had received a notice from the nasdaq stock market  inc that the bid price of its common stock had closed below per share for the previous consecutive trading days and that  in accordance with nasdaq rules  vitex would be provided calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under the rules for continued listing 
vitex has until february  to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
in the event that at any time before february   the bid price of vitex common stock closes at per share or more for a minimum of consecutive trading days  nasdaq staff will notify vitex that it has achieved compliance with the rule 
however  vitex cannot assure you that it will be able to achieve compliance with this requirement 
in addition  on november   vitex reported that it had received a notice from the nasdaq stock market  inc that its stockholders equity as of september  had fallen below the nasdaq requirement for continued listing of million 
vitex s stockholders equity as of december  was million 
nasdaq noted that it is reviewing vitex s eligibility for continued listing on the nasdaq national market and  to facilitate this review  requested 
table of contents that vitex provide nasdaq with its plan to achieve and sustain compliance with all listing requirements 
vitex submitted its plan to regain compliance on november  as a condition to the closing of the financing with great point partners  llc  vitex has agreed  subject to stockholder approval  to effect a reverse stock split generally on the terms described in the joint proxy statement prospectus for its special meetings of stockholders scheduled for march  vitex anticipates that the reverse split will result in the per share price of vitex common stock exceeding per share immediately following the split  but there can be no assurance that the price will close above per share for the time required to be in compliance with the nasdaq stock price requirement 
on december   nasdaq notified vitex that  on the basis of the plan submitted on november   it was granting vitex an extension of time until february  to regain compliance with the stockholders equity requirement for continued listing  and until february  to regain compliance with the stock price requirement 
on february   vitex received from nasdaq a notice of extension of the deadline for reaching compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement until march  vitex believes that the merger and financing transactions will be sufficient to meet that requirement 
we have requested an extension of the deadline until march  to achieve compliance with the minimum bid price requirement from nasdaq in order to allow us to complete the merger and financing  although there can be no assurance that nasdaq will grant our request 
following the merger  the combined company may be required to qualify for listing on nasdaq under nasdaq s initial listing criteria  and we cannot assure you that nasdaq will accept the combined company s application 
under applicable nasdaq listing requirements  as a result of the ownership structure of the combined company after the merger  the combined company may be required to apply for listing to nasdaq under nasdaq s initial listing criteria 
under nasdaq rules governing reverse mergers  under certain circumstances  a surviving company resulting from the merger of a private company and a nasdaq listed public company may be required to apply for a new listing if nasdaq determines that the combination results in a change in control of the listed company 
factors that nasdaq will consider when determining whether a combination results in a change in control of the listed company include changes in management  board of directors  voting power  ownership and financial structure of the listed company as well as the similarity in the nature of the businesses of the combining companies and the relative size of the listed company and the private company 
following the closing of the merger  and without giving effect to any financing  panacos shareholders will own approximately of the combined company  which alone could lead nasdaq to conclude that vitex has undergone a change in control 
while vitex currently believes that  following the merger  the combined company will qualify for initial listing under those criteria  it cannot assure you that nasdaq will accept the combined company s listing 
if vitex were required to apply for initial listing of its securities on the nasdaq national market as of february   it would not meet the minimum bid price per share requirement for initial listings of 
if nasdaq did not accept the listing application  the combined company would be required to apply for listing of its common stock on another market  which could have an adverse effect on the trading volume and liquidity of the common stock 
risks relating to vitex and panacos as a combined company vitex and panacos have historically incurred operating losses and these losses will continue after the merger 
vitex and panacos have each historically incurred substantial operating losses due to their research and development activities and expect these losses to continue after the merger for the foreseeable future 
as of december   vitex and panacos had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and million  respectively 
vitex s fiscal year  and net losses were million  million  and million  respectively 
panacos fiscal year  and net losses were million  million  and million  respectively 
vitex s fiscal year  and operating losses were million  million  and million  respectively 
panacos fiscal year  and operating losses were million  million and million  respectively 
vitex currently expects to continue research and development activities 
the combined company will expend significant amounts on the research and 
table of contents development programs previously undertaken by panacos  including those relating to pa the inactine red blood cell phase iii clinical trial program for acute indications  though enrollment is currently suspended  and the pa clinical trial program are being conducted in various geographic locations  and clinical studies may occur in other geographic markets 
in addition  prior to the end of  pa is expected to progress to late stage phase ii trials 
in parallel to the clinical development activities  the combined company would increase expenditures for pre commercial activities  such as planning for  and preliminary investments in  the scale up of manufacturing of the drug  and marketing and distribution of the drug both in the us and internationally 
the combined company would also plan to evaluate marketing partnerships for distribution as well as to fund a portion of the late stage clinical development of the drug 
these activities will take time and expense  both to identify the best partners and reach agreement on terms  and to negotiate and sign definitive agreements 
vitex will actively seek new financing from time to time to provide financial support for new activities 
however  at this time vitex is not able to assess the probability of success in its fundraising efforts or the terms  if any  under which it may secure financial support from strategic partners 
it is expected that vitex will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
the combined company will need additional capital in the future  but its access to such capital is uncertain 
vitex s current resources are insufficient to fund all of its and  following the merger  the combined company s  commercialization efforts 
as of february   vitex had cash on hand of approximately million  and panacos had cash on hand of approximately million 
as described elsewhere in this proxy statement prospectus  vitex has recently entered into definitive agreements with respect to million in financing  the closing of which is to occur upon closing of the merger 
at present  after its recent restructuring  vitex is consuming approximately million in cash per month and expects this spending rate to continue into early following the merger  the combined company expects to spend approximately million on average in cash per month in vitex believes that its present cash resources will be adequate to meet its requirements through the first quarter of vitex s capital needs beyond fiscal will depend on many factors  including its research and development activities  the scope of its clinical trial program  the completion of the merger with panacos  the timing of regulatory approval for its products under development and the successful commercialization of its products 
vitex s needs may also depend on the magnitude and scope of these activities  the progress and the level of success in its clinical trials  the costs of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in or terminations of existing collaboration and licensing arrangements  the establishment of collaboration and licensing arrangements and the cost of manufacturing scale up and development of marketing activities  if undertaken by the combined company 
other than the financing described in this document which is contingent on the merger  vitex does not have committed external sources of funding 
should the merger not close  vitex may not be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the combined company may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its development programs  obtain funds through arrangements with collaboration partners or others that may require it to relinquish rights to technologies  product candidates or products that it would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize itself  license rights to technologies  product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to it than might otherwise be available  or seek a buyer for all or a portion of its business  or wind down its operations and liquidate its assets 
if vitex raises additional funds by issuing additional stock  further dilution to its stockholders may result  and new investors could have rights superior to existing stockholders 
if funding is insufficient at any time in the future  vitex may be unable to develop or commercialize its products  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 

table of contents vitex s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on future financing 
kpmg llp  vitex s independent registered public accounting firm  has included an explanatory paragraph in their report on vitex s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   which highlights that current cash balances are insufficient to support operations until the end of  thereby raising substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
ernst young llp  panacos independent registered public accounting firm  is also expected to include a similar explanatory paragraph in their report on panacos financial statements for the year ended december  the inclusion of a going concern explanatory paragraph in kpmg llp s report on the consolidated financial statements of vitex and in ernst young llp s report on the financial statements of panacos could have a detrimental effect on vitex s stock price  the proposed rights offering and ability to raise additional capital 
vitex s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
vitex has not made any adjustments to the consolidated financial statements as a result of the outcome of the uncertainty described above 
the success of the combined company will depend on the products and systems which it is and will be developing  including the inactine system  but may be unable to commercialize due to numerous factors  including regulatory requirements on both the combined company and its customers 
the success of the combined company s business will depend on its successful development and commercialization of its products and systems  including products based on the inactine system 
successful commercialization of the combined company s products and systems under development depends  in significant part  on its ability to complete their development in a timely fashion  demonstrate their safety and efficacy in clinical trials  obtain and maintain patents or other proprietary protections  obtain required regulatory approvals  implement efficient  commercial scale manufacturing processes  obtain approval for reimbursement under health care systems  and establish and maintain development  sales  marketing  and distribution collaborations 
vitex s pathogen inactivation system for red blood cells is currently the only product being developed by vitex  and together with panacos product candidate pa  will be the only two clinical stage products of the combined company when the merger closes 
the inactine system is under development and has not been approved by the food and drug administration for marketing in the united states or by regulatory authorities in other countries 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals is generally lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
satisfaction of pre market approval or other regulatory requirements of the fda  or similar requirements of non united states regulatory agencies  typically takes several years  depending upon the type  complexity  novelty and intended purpose of the product 
the regulatory process includes pre clinical animal studies and clinical human trials of each product to establish its safety and efficacy 
during fiscal years  and  vitex spent approximately million  million and million on research and development  respectively 
the combined company must provide the fda and foreign regulatory authorities with pre clinical and clinical data that demonstrate its products are safe and effective before they can be approved for commercial sale 
in november  vitex suspended enrollment in its phase iii surgical  or acute  study for its lead product candidate  the inactine red cell system  following identification of an immune response to inactine treated red cells in one patient during ongoing immunologic testing of subjects enrolled in the trial 
as a result  both the phase iii trial of inactine for acute indications and the phase iii trial of inactine for chronic 
table of contents indications  described in more detail below  have been halted  in the case of the chronic trial  following a clinical hold by the fda 
although no clinical consequences of the immune response were apparent based on review of available data  additional patients will not be enrolled in the acute trial pending full evaluation 
vitex has notified the fda that it has voluntarily suspended enrollment in the study and it intends to continue discussions with fda regarding the conditions  if any  under which the trial might be continued while vitex is completing its review of all relevant data 
vitex intends to conduct these discussions as part of an ongoing dialogue with the fda regarding conditions for licensure of the inactine system 
vitex s phase iii chronic study of inactine red cells was placed on clinical hold by the fda due to the availability of insufficient safety information  and was subsequently halted by vitex following a review by an independent data safety monitoring committee  or dsmc  in november the halting of the study by vitex was due to antibody formation in sickle cell anemia patients receiving repeat transfusions of inactine treated red cells 
the phase iii trial of inactine for chronic indications was designed to be conducted in two sequential parts  part a and part b 
the purpose of part a was to allow assessment of the safety of inactine treated red cells in the patient population under study prior to proceeding to part b 
enrollment in the chronic trial was stopped prior to initiation of part b on the recommendation in november of the dsmc  which was charged with reviewing the data from part a of the study  following the fda s clinical hold on the trial due to availability of insufficient safety information 
prior to the suspension of the surgical trial  the fda had expressed concerns regarding the licensing of the current inactine system for an acute indication in light of the presence of antibodies observed in the chronic trial  and had requested justification from the company for pursuit of an acute only indication in the context of these findings 
the fda had also indicated that a control system with respect to an acute only indication would be required to ensure that patients who have previously received red cells treated by the current inactine system do not receive inactine red cells in subsequent hospitalizations 
vitex has met with the fda and presented proposals on supplemental clinical trials 
however  the fda has indicated that it will require the review of additional data  including the results of the phase iii trial for inactine in acute indications  before fully responding to vitex s proposals for additional clinical trials 
the occurrence of an immune response in the acute trial and the decision to suspend enrollment in it will require vitex to formulate and present to the fda a regulatory plan for approval of inactine that takes into account all findings to date  which is likely to significantly delay determination of any acceptable regulatory pathway 
the fda has indicated that any such regulatory plan for the acute only indication must address the development of a control system  as described above 
in addition  vitex believes that modifications to the current inactine process that are designed to reduce the likelihood of an immunologic response to treated red cells will also be required 
at this time  vitex cannot determine the length of time required for it to develop such a regulatory plan  nor can vitex estimate the length of time required for the fda to approve such a plan  or whether such a plan will be approved at all 
enrollment in the acute trial will continue to be suspended until such time as a regulatory plan is approved by the fda and implemented by vitex  if ever 
vitex has begun preclinical testing on the modifications to the current inactine process that are designed to reduce the likelihood of an immunologic response to treated red cells 
however  this work is preliminary and no assurance can be given that vitex will be able to develop an inactine process that will be technically feasible  approved by the fda  and economically viable  or that the modifications to the current inactine process will succeed in reducing the likelihood of an immunologic response 
prior to the suspension of enrollment in the acute study  the fda also directed vitex to implement additional patient safety monitoring procedures in the now suspended phase iii acute trial 
vitex implemented these procedures and  until accrual into the trial was suspended  was periodically updating the fda on the trial data 
while vitex believes that the steps taken addressed the fda recommendations prior to suspension of enrollment in the acute trial  further steps could be required by the fda 
vitex also received from the fda a written request for further information relating to an august amendment to its ind 
the amendment included responses to questions raised by the fda relating to procedures for patient safety monitoring used in the phase iii chronic study  which had been placed on clinical hold by the fda due to the availability of insufficient safety information  and subsequently halted by vitex following a dsmc review 
vitex has responded to the fda s request and is awaiting further communications from the agency on this matter 

table of contents with the phase iii trial for inactine in chronic indications halted by vitex  following the clinical hold by the fda and the subsequent review by the dsmc  and enrollment suspended in the phase iii trial for inactine in acute indications  vitex s ongoing development plan for inactine for chronic  acute or other indications is highly uncertain 
vitex cannot ensure that the acute trial will resume or complete enrollment in a timely manner  if ever 
the exact nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to bring to market the product resulting from vitex s pathogen inactivation research and development projects involve a number of key variables which are either unpredictable or outside vitex s control  including whether the likelihood of an immune response to inactine treated red cells can be adequately reduced  whether  and under what circumstances  the fda will agree with a plan by vitex to proceed with clinical trials  the enrollment rates and results of the phase iii clinical trial  should it be continued  the extent of further studies which could be required for filing a biologics license application with the fda  the length of the fda and foreign regulatory approval processes  the success of vitex s fundraising efforts  its ability to establish and maintain relationships with marketing partners and strategic collaborators  and the timing of commencement of commercialization of its product 
inability to satisfy one or more of these conditions  or to do so in a commercially acceptable manner  may render continued development of the inactine system infeasible 
delays in the combined company s clinical testing or approval from government authorities will increase its product development costs and may impair its ability to commercialize its products and allow competitors to bring products to market before the combined company does 
vitex s clinical development plan for cellular products  including inactine  assumes that only data from laboratory studies  not from human clinical trials  will be required to demonstrate efficacy in reducing pathogens and that clinical trials for these products will instead focus on demonstrating therapeutic efficacy  safety and tolerability of treated blood components 
although vitex has held discussions with the fda concerning the proposed clinical plan for these products  this plan of demonstrating safety and efficacy may not ultimately be acceptable to the fda or the fda may reconsider any decision that this clinical plan is appropriate 
even if the combined company s products receive approval for commercial sale  their manufacture  storage  marketing and distribution are and will be subject to extensive and continuing regulation in the united states by the federal government  especially the fda  and state and local governments 
the failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action  including  without limitation  withdrawal of approval  which would harm the combined company s business 
later discovery of problems with the combined company s products may result in additional restriction on the product  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
regulatory authorities may also require post marketing testing  which can involve significant expenses 
additionally  governments may impose new regulations  which could further delay or preclude regulatory approval of the combined company s products or result in significantly increased compliance costs 
in similar fashion to the fda  foreign regulatory authorities require demonstration of product quality  safety and efficacy prior to granting authorization for product registration which allows for distribution of the product for commercial sale 
international organizations  such as the world health organization  and foreign government agencies including those for the americas  middle east  europe  and asia and the pacific  have laws  regulations and guidelines for reporting and evaluating the data on safety  quality and efficacy of new drug products 
although most of these laws  regulations and guidelines are very similar  each of the individual nations reviews all of the information available on the new drug product and makes an independent determination for product registration 
in addition to the regulatory requirements applicable to the combined company and its products and systems  there are regulatory requirements applicable to its prospective customers for the inactine system  which are the blood banks that process and distribute both blood and blood products 
blood banks  such as the american red cross and the new york blood center  will be required to obtain approved license supplements from the fda before using products processed with vitex pathogen reduction systems 
fda delays in approving these supplements may deter some blood centers from using vitex products 
in addition  blood centers that do submit supplements may face disapproval or delays in approval that could in turn cause further delay or deter them from using vitex products 

table of contents the success of the combined company will also depend on the antiviral therapeutics being developed  including pa  and we cannot assure you that the efforts to commercialize pa  which is still in early stage clinical trials  will succeed 
together with the inactine system  pa will be the only clinical stage product to be developed by vitex following the completion of the merger 
pa and the other compounds being developed by vitex are still in early stage clinical trials and involve a high degree of development  technical  regulatory and other risks 
the results from pre clinical studies and early clinical trials conducted by panacos prior to the merger do not ensure that results obtained in later stage clinical studies of pa will be satisfactory to the fda or foreign regulatory authorities 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
completion of clinical trials may also be delayed by slower than anticipated patient enrollment  negative or inconclusive clinical results or other adverse circumstances occurring during the clinical trials 
therefore  the combined company cannot ensure that clinical trials will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain required marketing approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
positive results from preclinical studies or early clinical trials should not be relied upon as evidence that later or larger scale clinical trials will succeed 
initial clinical trials of pa have been conducted only in small numbers of patients that may not fully represent the diversity present in larger populations infected with hiv or the results of long term drug administration  and thus the limited results panacos has obtained prior to the merger may not predict results from more prolonged studies in larger numbers of patients drawn from more diverse populations 
these initial trials are not designed to assess the long term efficacy of pa vitex will be required to demonstrate through larger scale clinical trials that these product candidates are safe and effective for use in a diverse population before it can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale 
there is typically an extremely high rate of attrition from the failure of drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials 
if pa or any other product candidate fails to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in any clinical trial  the combined company would experience potentially significant delays in  or be required to abandon  development of that product candidate 
if the combined company delays or abandons its development efforts related to pa  it may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to become profitable  and its reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be significantly damaged  each of which would cause the stock price to decrease significantly 
if the combined company fails to establish relationships with strategic collaborators and distributors  it may be unable to market its products 
the combined company intends to enlist strategic collaborators for sales  marketing and distribution support and for financial support in the development of its products 
the combined company will require marketing and distribution partners for the commercialization of its products 
if the combined company fails to develop new strategic partnerships for these purposes  the failure could delay or possibly inhibit the commercialization of its products 
for example  in order to effectively market its products outside the united states  the combined company may need to secure foreign marketing partners who have a strong presence in such foreign markets 
securing new corporate collaborators is a time consuming process  and vitex cannot guarantee that the negotiations with new collaborators will yield positive results 
even if it finds additional corporate collaborators to assist in the commercialization of existing or new product candidates  the terms of the arrangements may not be favorable or acceptable to the combined company 
a small number of customers will determine market acceptance of some of vitex s products 
a defined number of blood collection services will dominate any market for the inactine system 
in the united states  the american red cross and the america s blood centers collect and distribute the vast majority of the nation s supply of blood and blood components 
major united states blood centers include the new york blood center and the united blood services  which together distributes approximately percent of the nation s 
table of contents supply of blood and blood components 
in europe and japan  various national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations blood and blood components supply 
failure to properly market  price or sell vitex products to any of these large customers could significantly diminish the combined company s potential product revenue 
vitex relies on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture its inactivation compound and other components of its inactine system for red cells 
vitex s inactine system uses a small molecule compound known as pen to inactivate pathogens 
vitex has a contract with one manufacturer for pen and will seek to qualify additional manufacturers to produce this compound to meet its anticipated commercialization requirements 
if any of these additional manufacturers  which have not yet been identified  or its existing manufacturer cannot produce and deliver this compound in the required quantities  to the required standards  or in a timely manner  the combined company may face delays in the commercialization of the inactine system before it is able to identify alternate or additional manufacturers to meet these requirements 
the procedure for inactivating pathogens using the inactine system requires the use of an automated inactine system to deliver the compound into the red cell unit and a cell washing system to remove pen  plasma proteins and other impurities 
vitex worked with an engineering firm to develop the automated delivery system which is now being qualified for use in its clinical trials 
this system and related system disposables could be manufactured by several suppliers and vitex has not yet entered commercial supply agreements 
vitex is currently using a cell washing system manufactured by haemonetics  which it exclusively licenses from haemonetics pursuant to a development and manufacturing agreement 
when and if vitex s inactine system is commercialized  haemonetics will provide contract manufacturing services for the cell washing equipment and associated disposables 
if haemonetics fails to deliver an adequate supply of the cell washing systems and disposables  the combined company would be required to identify other third party manufacturers 
vitex may not be able to identify manufacturers for the delivery system and disposables or to replace haemonetics for the wash system and disposables on a timely basis or enter into contracts with such manufacturers on reasonable terms  if at all 
any delay in the availability of these systems and disposables could delay commercialization and subsequent sales of the inactine system 
furthermore  the inclusion of delivery and cell washing systems by new manufacturers could require the combined company to seek new approvals from governmental regulatory authorities  which could result in delays in product delivery 
vitex may not be able to receive any such required regulatory approvals 
if the combined company does not successfully distinguish and commercialize its technology  it may be unable to compete successfully or to generate revenue significant to sustain its operations 
the biotechnology industry  including the fields of transfusion medicine  therapeutic use of blood products  and therapeutic products to treat hiv and serious infections  is highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change 
accordingly  vitex s success will depend  in part  on its ability to respond quickly to such change through the development and introduction of new products and systems 
many of the combined company s competitors or potential competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than vitex has and may also have for the viral inactivation of red cells  greater experience in conducting pre clinical studies  clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures as well as in marketing their products 
major competitors in the market for hiv drugs include large  publicly traded pharmaceutical companies  such as glaxosmithkline  bristol myers squibb  pfizer  roche  johnson johnson  and gilead  development stage public companies  such as incyte and vertex  and private development stage companies  such as pharmasset 
major competitors in the market for pathogen inactivation systems include baxter healthcare  gambro bct  and cerus 
if vitex or its corporate partners commence commercial product sales  vitex or its corporate partners will be competing against companies with greater marketing and manufacturing capabilities 

table of contents vitex s ability to compete successfully against currently existing and future alternatives to its product candidates and systems  and competitors who compete directly with it in the pathogen reduction industry will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain skilled scientific and research personnel  develop technologically superior products  develop competitively priced products  obtain patent or other required regulatory approvals for the combined company s products  be early entrants to the market  and manufacture  market and sell its products  independently or through collaborations 
third party reimbursement policies may adversely affect the combined company s ability to commercialize and sell its products and services 
the combined company s ability to successfully commercialize its products depends in part on the extent to which appropriate levels of reimbursement for its products and related treatments are obtained from government authorities  private health insurers  third party payers  and other organizations  such as managed care organizations  or mcos 
any failure by doctors  hospitals and other users of the combined company s products or systems to obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement could adversely affect the combined company s ability to sell these products and systems 
federal legislation  enacted in december  has altered the way in which physician administered drug programs covered by medicare are reimbursed  generally leading to lower reimbursement levels 
the new legislation has also added an outpatient prescription drug benefit to medicare  effective january in the interim  the united states congress has established a discount drug card program for medicare beneficiaries 
both benefits will be provided through private entities  which will attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers 
these negotiations may increase pressures to lower prices 
on the other hand  the drug benefit may increase the volume of pharmaceutical drug purchases  offsetting at least in part these potential price discounts 
while the new law specifically prohibits the united states government from interfering in price negotiations between manufacturers and medicare drug plan sponsors  some members of congress are pursuing legislation that would permit de facto price controls on prescription drugs 
in addition  the law triggers  for congressional consideration  cost containment measures for medicare in the event medicare cost increases exceed a certain level 
these cost containment measures could include limitations on prescription drug prices 
this legislation could adversely impact the combined company s ability to commercialize any of its products successfully 
significant uncertainty exists about the reimbursement status of newly approved medical products and services 
reimbursement in the united states or foreign countries may not be available for any of the combined company s products  reimbursement granted may not be maintained  and limits on reimbursement available from third party payers may reduce the demand for  or negatively affect the price of  the combined company s products 
vitex anticipates that it will need to work with a variety of organizations to lobby government agencies for improved reimbursement policies for its products 
however  vitex cannot guarantee that such lobbying efforts will take place or that they will ultimately be successful 
if the combined company is unable to protect its intellectual property  it may not be able to operate its business profitably 
vitex s success following the merger will depend on its ability to develop proprietary products and technologies  to obtain and maintain patents  to protect trade secrets  and to prevent others from infringing on its proprietary rights 
vitex has exclusive patents  licenses to patents or patent applications covering critical components of its technologies as well as certain jointly owned patents 
vitex also seeks to protect its proprietary technology and processes  in part  by confidentiality agreements with its employees and certain 
table of contents contractors 
patents  pending patent applications and licensed technologies may not afford adequate protection against competitors  and any pending patent applications now or hereafter filed by or licensed to vitex may not result in patents being issued 
in addition  certain of vitex s technology relies on patented inventions developed using university resources 
universities may have certain rights  as defined by law or applicable agreements  in such patents  and may choose to exercise such rights 
under the terms of a license agreement between panacos and the university of north carolina  panacos vitex following the merger is an exclusive licensee to certain technology  including patents and patent applications  that relate to the company s product candidates  including pa this license agreement imposes various commercialization  sublicensing  royalty and other obligations on us 
if we fail to comply with these and other requirements  our license could convert from exclusive to non exclusive or terminate entirely 
currently  panacos vitex following the merger is in compliance with the terms of the license agreement  and we do not have any reason to believe that the license may be terminated 
vitex cannot be certain that their confidentiality agreements will not be breached  that they will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that their trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that employees  consultants or contractors of the combined company use intellectual property owned by others  disputes may arise as to the rights related to or resulting from the know how and inventions 
in addition  the laws of certain non united states countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  vitex cannot predict with certainty their enforceability 
the combined company is a party to various license agreements that give it exclusive rights to use specified technologies applicable to research  development and commercialization of its products  including pa the agreements pursuant to which such technology is used permit the licensors to terminate agreements in the event that certain conditions are not met 
if these conditions are not met and the agreements are terminated  the combined company s product development  research and commercialization efforts may be altered or delayed 
patents or patent applications  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or may not provide protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  competitors of the combined company may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights for technology similar to the combined company s that could limit its ability to use its technology or commercialize products that it may develop 
litigation may be necessary to assert claims of infringement  to enforce patents issued to vitex  to protect trade secrets or know how or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation or interference proceedings could result in substantial additional costs and diversion of management focus 
if vitex is ultimately unable to protect its technology  trade secrets or know how  it may be unable to operate profitably 
although neither vitex nor panacos has been involved with any threats of litigation or negotiations regarding patent issues or other intellectual property  or other related court challenges or legal actions  it is possible that the combined company could be involved with such matters in the future 
if the combined company is unable to operate its business without infringing upon intellectual property rights of others  it may not be able to operate its business profitably 
the combined company s success depends on its ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
vitex is aware that patents have been applied for and or issued to third parties claiming technologies for decontamination of blood and blood products that may be similar to those needed by vitex 
vitex endeavors to follow developments in these fields and it does not believe that its technologies and or products infringe upon any proprietary rights of third parties 
to the extent that planned or potential products turn out to be covered by patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties  the combined company would need a license under such patents or other intellectual property rights to continue development and marketing of its products 
any required licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if the combined company does not obtain such licenses  it may need to design around other parties patents or it may not be able to proceed with the development  manufacture or sale of its products 

table of contents litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation or interference proceedings could result in substantial additional costs and diversion of management focus 
if the combined company is ultimately unsuccessful in defending against claims of infringement  it may be unable to operate profitably 
if vitex loses or is unable to hire and retain qualified personnel  it may not be able to develop its products and technology 
vitex is highly dependent on the members of its scientific and management staff 
in particular  the combined company will depend on dr 
samuel k 
ackerman  the chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
vitex and panacos do not have employment contracts with any key personnel 
although vitex believes it has been successful in attracting and retaining its employees  it may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms  if at all  given the competition for such personnel among other companies and research and academic institutions 
if the combined company loses an executive officer or certain key members of its clinical or research and development staff or is unable to hire and retain qualified personnel  then its ability to develop and commercialize its products and technology may be hindered 
vitex has not purchased any key man life insurance 
vitex uses and generates hazardous materials in its research activities 
defending against any claims relating to the improper handling  storage  release or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
vitex is subject to federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials  biological specimens and wastes 
it is possible that the combined company will be required in the future to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations 
the research and development activities to be undertaken by vitex involve the use of hazardous materials  including chemicals that may cause cancer  volatile solvents  and biological materials  including materials infected with various viruses  including human immunodeficiency virus  human t cell lyphotrophic virus  and simian immunodeficiency virus 
in addition  the operations of vitex produce  and will continue to produce after the consummation of the merger  hazardous waste products 
although vitex believes that its safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standard prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  vitex could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could exceed its insurance limits and its cash resources 
vitex has general liability insurance that covers its use of hazardous materials and chemicals 
neither vitex nor panacos has been notified that it has been the subject of any investigations relating to the generation of hazardous materials in the past 
the combined company may face exposure to product liability claims 
vitex may face exposure to product liability and other claims due to allegations that its products cause harm 
these risks are inherent in the suspended phase iii clinical trials relating to the inactine system and the ongoing phase ii clinical trials relating to pa and in the testing  and future manufacturing and marketing of the combined company s products 
although vitex currently maintains product liability insurance  such insurance may not be adequate and the combined company may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if the combined company is unable to obtain product liability insurance in the future at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims  it could be inhibited in the commercialization of its products which could have a material adverse effect on its business 
vitex and panacos currently have policies covering million of product liability for their respective clinical trials 
neither vitex nor panacos currently has sales of any products 
the level of product liability insurance coverage and the associated cost of that insurance for the combined company will be determined following the merger 
the coverage will be maintained and limits reviewed from time to time as the vitex clinical programs progress to later stages of its clinical trials and as the length of the trials and the 
table of contents number of patients enrolled in the trials changes 
vitex intends to obtain a combined coverage policy that includes tail coverage in order to cover any claims that are made for any events that have occurred prior to the merger 
currently  each company s annual premium for product liability insurance is approximately   item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to the effects of changes in interest rates on our investments of available cash balances in money market funds 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
