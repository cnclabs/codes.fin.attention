 as amended  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the instrument will be either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of an instrument s change in fair value  as defined by sfas no 
 as amended  will be immediately recognized in earnings as a component of cost of sales 
additionally  the company holds certain positions  primarily in grain and livestock futures  which do not meet the criteria for sfas no 
hedge accounting

the changes in market value of derivatives used in the company s risk management activities surrounding forward sales contracts are recorded in sales 
the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities 
sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions management may take to mitigate the company s exposure to changes  nor do they consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity 
actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 
commodities risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  such as corn  soybeans  livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations 
the company uses commodity futures to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity 
however  as the commodities underlying the company s derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations  any requirement to mark to market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 
could result in volatility in the company s results of operations 
generally  contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation 
contracts that are designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting 
the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of in market prices as of october   and october   respectively  on fair value of open positions 
the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices 
the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and non hedge positions 
the underlying commodities hedged have a correlation to price changes of the derivative positions such that the values of the commodities hedged based on differences between commitment prices and market prices and the value of the derivative positions used to hedge these commodity obligations are inversely correlated 
the following sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions
