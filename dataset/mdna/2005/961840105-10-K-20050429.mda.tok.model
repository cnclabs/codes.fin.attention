item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  may contain various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act  which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events 
forward looking statements include statements that are predictive in nature  which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions  which include words such as believes  plans  anticipates  estimates  expects or similar expressions 
in addition  any statements concerning future financial performance  ongoing business strategies or prospects  and possible future actions  which may be provided by our management  are also forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions about our company  economic and market factors and the industry in which we do business  among other things 
these statements are not guaranties of future performance and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward looking statements due to a number of factors 
factors that could cause our actual performance  future results and actions to differ materially from any forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors below and discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
risk factors risks related to our business we may be unable to reverse declines in comparable store sales and net losses from continuing operations  both of which could significantly impact our economic viability 
the economic survival of our company is significantly dependent on our ability to reverse declines in comparable store sales and then sustain comparable store sales growth 
our comparable store sales results have declined significantly during the past two years and a substantial portion of these declines have been attributable to our wet seal division 
these declines in comparable store sales have resulted in a net loss from continuing operations in our ability to improve our comparable store sales results depends in large part on a number of factors  some of which are outside of our control  including improving our forecasting of demand and fashion trends  providing an appropriate mix of appealing merchandise for our targeted customer base  managing inventory effectively  using more effective pricing strategies  selecting effective marketing techniques  optimizing store performance by closing under performing stores  calendar shifts of holiday periods and general economic conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience future declines in comparable store sales and net losses from continuing operations  both of which would significantly impact our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows in the past two years and we may not be able to reverse these losses 
we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows during each of fiscal and although we have received approximately million in net proceeds after transaction expenses from the investors in the january private placement and expect to receive approximately million after transaction expenses and retirement of the bridge loan facility in net proceeds in the april private placement  we will encounter liquidity constraints if our operating losses and negative cash flows continue 
in such event  we will be forced to seek alternatives to address these constraints  including seeking additional debt financing or equity financing or a potential reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
in the event we need to seek additional financing  we will need to obtain the prior approval of our lenders and there is no assurance we will receive such approvals on terms acceptable to us 
as a result of our operating losses and negative cash flows  we have experienced a tightening of credit extended to us by vendors  factors and others for merchandise and services  which could cause us to experience delays or disruption in merchandise flow 
due to our recent financial results  we have experienced a tightening of credit extended to us by vendors  factors  and others for merchandise and services 
the impact of this credit tightening has required us to issue letters of credit outside of the ordinary course of business  or  in many instances  shorten vendor credit terms 
if supply difficulties arise due to this credit tightening we could experience delays or disruption in merchandise flow  which  in turn  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our decision to close certain wet seal stores may not significantly improve our financial condition or results of operations 
on december   we announced that we would close approximately wet seal stores as part of our turn around strategy 
we appointed hilco to manage the inventory liquidations for the stores that we have closed and hilco advisors to negotiate with the respective landlords 
we completed the store closing effort on march  and through that date we closed a total of stores 
upon the decision to close these stores  we wrote down the carrying value of these impaired assets to realizable value  a non cash event that negatively impacted our earnings and earnings per share 
further  by closing these stores before the expiration of the applicable lease term  we are required in most instances to make payments to the landlords in the form of cash and or equity payments to terminate or buy out the remaining term of the applicable lease 
although hilco is in negotiations with the landlords on our behalf  we cannot assure you that we will be able to reach an agreement with all the landlords on terms acceptable to us 
moreover  although these stores have been underperforming as compared with our other wet seal stores  there is no assurance that in the long term these store closures will have a significant positive impact upon our operating results or that we will not have to close additional stores in the future 
furthermore  if we are not successful in reducing our non store expenses  including our general and administrative overhead  in line with our reduced store count and projected revenues  it is unlikely that we would achieve significant profitability even if our net sales revenue increases 
covenants contained in agreements governing our existing indebtedness restrict the manner in which we conduct our business and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  growth prospects and ability to procure merchandise for our stores 
our senior credit facility  bridge loan facility and the indenture governing our notes contain covenants that restrict the manner in which we conduct our business 
subject to certain exceptions  these covenants restrict  among other things  our ability  and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries  to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness  make investments or acquisitions  merge  consolidate  dissolve or liquidate  engage in certain asset sales including the sale of stock  grant liens or assets  pay dividends  and close stores 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing our existing indebtedness  acceleration of any amounts then outstanding  the foreclosure upon collateral securing the debt obligations  or the unavailability of the lines of credit 
as a result  our ability to continue as a going concern would be significantly impacted and may require our company to file for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
we may not have sufficient funds to make required payments on the notes 
although we anticipate receiving approximately million in net proceeds after transaction expenses and the retirement of the bridge loan facility from the april private placement  we may not have sufficient funds to make the interest and principal payments on the notes when due  either at maturity or upon the occurrence of certain events 
if we do not have sufficient funds to make these payments  we will have to obtain an alternative source of funds  including sales of our assets or assets of our subsidiaries or sales of our equity securities or capital 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to meet our payment obligations on the notes through any of these alternatives or that we will be permitted by our senior lenders to obtain funds through any of these alternatives 
in the event that we are not able to make the required payments at maturity or otherwise  we will be forced to seek alternatives  including seeking additional debt financing or equity financing or a potential reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
our company is a defendant in a class action and the subject of an investigation by the securities and exchange commission 
as previously reported  our company  certain of our former directors  and former and current officers  have been named as defendants in several securities class actions 
these actions have now been consolidated in the united states district court for the central district of california 
on or about february   the district court appointed lead plaintiffs in the consolidated action  filed their consolidated class action complaint for violation of the federal securities laws  entitled laborer s international union of north america local union and district counsel fund  laborer s national industrial pension fund  et 
al  plaintiffs  v 
wet seal inc  irving teitelbaum  peter d 
whitford  douglas c 
felderman  walter parks  joseph e 
deckop  allan haims  stephen gross  and la senza corporation  defendants 
the consolidated complaint alleges violations of section b of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act and rule b promulgated thereunder  and section a of the exchange act by  among other allegations  making false and misleading statements concerning the progress of our company to stem the losses of our wet seal division and return that business to profitability as well as the illegal use of material non public information by former directors and a company controlled by them 
the plaintiff seeks class certification  compensatory damages  interest  costs and attorney s fees and expenses 
we intend to make a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint but there is no assurance it will be successful 
if significant damages are assessed against our company it may  in the future  have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our company and the results of operations 
in february  we announced that the pacific regional office of the securities and exchange commission sec had commenced an informal  non public inquiry regarding our company 
we indicated that the sec s inquiry generally related to the events and announcements regarding our company s second quarter earnings and the sale of our class a common stock by la senza corporation and its affiliates during the sec has advised us that on april  it issued a formal order of investigation in connection with its review of matters relating to the company 
consistent with the previous announcement  the company intends to cooperate fully with the sec s inquiry 
it is too soon to determine whether the outcome of this inquiry will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we have had significant management changes recently and these changes may impact our ability to execute our turn around strategy in the near term 
in general  our success depends to a significant extent on the performance of our senior management  particularly personnel engaged in merchandising and store operations  and on our ability to identify  hire and retain additional key management personnel 
in november  the chairman and chief executive officer and the president of our wet seal division resigned from our company 
in addition  as part of our turn around strategy  all of the members of our board of directors  other than henry d 
winterstern and alan siegel  have either resigned or retired 
in december and january  we appointed a new president and chief executive officer and four members to our board of directors 
we anticipate that we will experience a transition period before this new management team is fully integrated with our company  which could impact our ability to confront the financial challenges that impact our company 
in addition  there is a risk that we may lose additional members of our senior management team 
if so  due to the intense competition for qualified personnel in the retail apparel industry  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify  hire or retain the key personnel with the merchandising and management skills necessary to implement our turn around strategy and offer appealing products to our target market 
we need to employ personnel with the requisite merchandising skills to continue our merchandising strategy implemented by mr 
gold 
michael gold has been responsible for developing and implementing the new merchandising strategy for our wet seal division 
mr 
gold and our company have not yet entered into a formal agreement to compensate mr 
gold for these efforts 
if we reach an agreement  we intend to provide him with a significant incentive based compensation package which may take the form of restricted stock grants  warrants or options in order to compensate him for his efforts to date and in the near term future 
mr 
gold s commitment to our company has been and will continue to be part time 
we  therefore  are actively seeking personnel with sufficient merchandising skills to continue the merchandising strategy implemented by mr 
gold 
in the event we are unable to reach an agreement with mr 
gold and he elects not to continue his relationship with our company  the results of our operations may be significantly and adversely impacted 
in addition  if we are unable to identify and retain personnel with outstanding merchandising skills to replace mr 
gold  our comparable store sales and sales revenue could decline 
the shares to be issued under our stock incentive plan will result in a substantial dilution of our earnings per share 
we recently established our stock incentive plan to attract and retain directors  officers  employees and consultants 
we have reserved million shares of our class a common stock for issuance under this incentive plan 
as of april   million shares of restricted class a common stock had been granted to joel n 
waller  our chief executive officer  our executive vice president of wet seal and our non employee directors 
in the near term we anticipate granting additional restricted shares in connection with the hiring or appointment of individuals  as well as company management who will assist us in returning our company to profitability  including mr 
gold 
as a result of the granting of restricted shares  we will incur non cash compensation expense charges to our earnings over the vesting periods or when the restrictions lapse 
as a result  the shares to be issued under the stock incentive plan will have a significant adverse effect on our results of operation and on our earnings per share 
our issuance of the notes and warrants  the incurrence of obligations under the bridge loan facility  and the proposed issuance of the preferred stock and new warrants will have a significant adverse effect on our earnings and earnings per share 
as a result of our issuance of the notes and related warrants and the proposed issuance of the preferred stock and new warrants and in accordance with accounting guidelines noted in emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios and eitf application of eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  to certain convertible instruments and accounting principles board no 
accounting for convertible debt issued with stock purchase warrants  we determined the fair market value of the warrants issued as well as the value of the beneficial conversion feature 
the value assigned to the warrants and the beneficial conversion feature reduced the face value of the notes resulting in a discount that will be amortized over the life of the notes 
the amortization of the discount will result in significant non cash charges and will have an adverse effect on our earnings and earnings per share 
the notes accrue interest at an annual rate of  while the loans made under the bridge loan facility accrue interest at an annual rate of through july  and thereafter 
since february   we have been required to pay supplemental interest on the outstanding principal amount including capitalized interest 
the monthly supplemental interest rate was for february  for march and thereafter 
if the bridge loan facility and the notes remain outstanding for all of fiscal  interest expense  whether capitalized or paid  will have a significant impact on our financial results 
prior to the conversion of the notes and the preferred stock if issued and the exercise of the warrants and the new warrants if issued  the shares of class a common stock underlying these securities would not be included in the calculation of basic or fully diluted per share results in the event of a net loss 
conversely  these securities would be included in the determination of fully diluted per share results in the event the company has net income 
although the holders of these securities may not convert or exercise the respective securities if they would own together with any affiliates more than of our class a common stock  upon such conversion and or exercise  as applicable  our earnings per share would be expected to decrease  or our net loss per share to decrease  as a result of the inclusion of the underlying shares of class a common stock in our per share calculations 
our internal controls have material weaknesses 
we have received an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting because of material weaknesses identified in management s assessment of the effectiveness of such controls 
these material weaknesses  if not remediated  create increased risk of misstatement of our financial results which  if material  may require restatement thereof 
if we are unable to anticipate and react to new fashion trends and or if there is a decrease in the demand for fashionable  casual apparel  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our brand image is dependent upon our ability to anticipate  identify and provide fresh inventory reflecting current fashion trends 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately or in a timely manner to these fashion trends  we could experience reduced consumer acceptance of our products  a diminished brand image and higher markdowns 
these factors could result in lower selling prices and sales volumes for our products  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
this risk is particularly acute because we rely on a limited demographic customer base for a large percentage of our sales 
our sales also depend upon the continued demand by our customers for fashionable  casual apparel 
demand for our merchandise could be negatively affected by shifts in consumer discretionary spending to other goods  such as electronic equipment  computers and music 
if the demand for apparel and related merchandise were to decline  our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected by any resulting decline in sales 
our failure to effectively compete with other retailers for sales and locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location  in store environment and service being the principal competitive factors 
we compete for sales with specialty apparel retailers  department stores and certain other apparel retailers  such as american eagle  banana republic  bcbg  bebe  charlotte russe  express  forever  gap  h m  old navy  pacific sunwear and urban outfitters 
we face a variety of competitive challenges  including anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands  maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in a narrowly defined market segment  developing innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors and styles that appeal to consumers in our target demographic  efficiently sourcing merchandise  and competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value 
in addition to the competitive challenges specified above  many of our competitors are large national chains  which have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do and which may be better able to adapt to changing conditions that affect the competitive market 
also  our industry has low barriers to entry that allows the introduction of new products or new competitors at a faster pace 
any of these factors could result in reductions in sales or the prices of our products which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
further  although we believe that we compete effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls and other locations  competition for prime locations and lease terms within shopping malls  in particular  and at other locations is intense  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new locations or maintain our existing locations on terms favorable to us  if at all 
historically we have grown through opening new stores  however  due to our financial condition we do not anticipate opening a significant number of additional stores in the immediate future which could adversely affect the growth of our business 
our company has historically expanded by opening new stores  remodeling existing stores and acquiring other store locations or businesses that complement and enhance our operations 
from time to time we have created new retail concepts such as arden b 
however  as result of our financial condition we may not be able to take advantage of certain business opportunities in the same manner as we have historically 
while a conservative approach to opening new stores may assist our efforts in the return to profitability  it may have a negative impact upon our growth within certain markets or require us to expend more capital to gain entry in the future 
because of the importance of our brand names  we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we have registered trademarks for wet seal and arden b 
which are registered in the retail store services class and pending in others 
we take actions to establish and protect our intellectual property 
however  we cannot assure you that others will not imitate our products or infringe on our intellectual property rights 
in addition  we cannot assure you that others will not resist or seek to block the sale of our products as violative of their intellectual property rights 
if we are required to stop using any of our registered or non registered marks  our sales could decline and  consequently  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our business is affected by local  regional and national economic conditions 
our business is sensitive to consumer spending patterns and preferences 
various economic conditions affect the level of spending on the merchandise we offer  including general business conditions  interest rates  taxation  and the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
our growth  sales and profitability may be adversely affected by unfavorable occurrences in these economic conditions on a local  regional or national level 
we are especially affected by economic conditions in california  where approximately of our stores are located 
further  the majority of our stores are located in regional shopping malls 
we derive sales  in part  from the high volume of traffic in these malls 
the inability of mall anchor tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores  or the decline in popularity of malls as shopping destinations would reduce our sales volume and  consequently  adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is seasonal in nature  and any decrease in our sales or margins during these periods could have a material adverse effect on our company 
the retail apparel industry is highly seasonal 
we generate our highest levels of sales during the christmas season  which begins the week of thanksgiving and ends the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  which begins the last week of july and ends the first week of september 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on the sales generated during these peak periods 
any decrease in sales or margins during these periods  whether as a result of economic conditions  poor weather or other factors beyond our control  could have a material adverse effect on our company 
we depend upon key vendors to supply us with merchandise for our stores  and the failure of these vendors to provide this merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends on our ability to purchase current season apparel in sufficient quantities at competitive prices 
the inability or failure of our key vendors to supply us with adequate quantities of desired merchandise  the loss of one or more key vendors or a material change in our current purchase terms could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations by causing us to experience excess inventories and higher markdowns 
we have no long term purchase contracts or other contractual assurances of continued supply  pricing or access to new products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities or on terms acceptable to us in the future  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon a single distribution facility  and any significant disruption in the operation of this facility could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the distribution functions for all of our stores are handled from a single  leased facility in foothill ranch  california 
any significant interruption in the operation of this facility due to a natural disaster  accident  system failure or other unforeseen event could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores and  consequently  lead to a decrease in sales 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we do not authenticate the license rights of our suppliers 
we purchase merchandise from a number of vendors who hold manufacturing and distribution rights under the terms of license agreements 
we generally rely upon each vendor s representation concerning those manufacturing and distribution rights and do not independently verify whether each vendor legally holds adequate rights to the licensed properties they are manufacturing or distributing 
if we acquire unlicensed merchandise  we could be obligated to remove it from our stores  incur costs associated with destruction of the merchandise if the vendor is unwilling or unable to reimburse us and be subject to civil and criminal liability 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we experience business risks as a result of our internet business 
we compete with internet businesses that handle similar lines of merchandise 
these competitors have certain advantages  including the inapplicability of sales tax and the absence of retail real estate and related costs 
as a result  increased internet sales by our competitors could result in increased price competition and decreased margins 
our internet operations are subject to numerous risks  including reliance on third party computer and hardware providers  diversion of sales from our retail stores  and online security breaches and or credit card fraud 
our inability to effectively address these risks and any other risks that we face in connection with our internet business could adversely affect the profitability of our internet business 
we are subject to risks associated with our procurement of products from non us based vendors  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a significant portion of our products is manufactured outside the united states 
as a result  we are susceptible to greater losses as a result of a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors beyond our control  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
these factors include import or trade restrictions including increased tariffs  customs duties  taxes or quotas imposed by the united states government in respect of the foreign countries in which our products are currently manufactured or any of the countries in which our products may be manufactured in the future  political instability or acts of terrorism  significant fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies and or restrictions on the transfer of funds between the united states and foreign jurisdictions  any of which could adversely affect our merchandise flow and  consequently  cause our sales to decline  and local business practices that do not conform to our legal or ethical guidelines 
our imports are limited by textile agreements between the united states and a number of foreign jurisdictions  including hong kong  china  taiwan and south korea 
these agreements impose quotas on the amounts and types of merchandise that may be imported into the united states from these countries 
these agreements also allow the united states to limit the importation of categories of merchandise that are not now subject to specified limits 
the united states and the countries in which our products are produced or sold may also  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty or tariff levels 
in addition  none of our international suppliers or international manufacturers supplies or manufactures our products exclusively 
as a result  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers and import quota capacity 
if we were unable to obtain our raw materials and finished apparel from the countries where we wish to purchase them  either because room or space under the necessary quotas was unavailable or for any other reason  or if the cost of doing so should increase  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
increases in federal and state statutory minimum wages could increase our expenses  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
connecticut  illinois  oregon  district of columbia  new york  and washington have each increased their state minimum wages to a level that significantly exceeded the federal minimum wage as of january  as of april   we operated stores in those states 
these recent increases in the state statutory minimum wage and any future federal or state minimum wage increases could raise minimum wages above the current wages of some of our employees 
as a result  competitive factors could require us to make corresponding increases in our employees wages 
increases in our wage rates increase our expenses  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
violation of labor laws and practices by our suppliers could harm our business and results of operations 
as part of our commitment to human rights  we require our domestic and foreign suppliers to abide by a code of conduct for vendors and suppliers  which sets forth guidelines for acceptable factory policies and procedures regarding workplace conditions  including wages and benefits  health and safety  working hours  working age  environmental conditions and ethical and legal matters 
if one of our suppliers fails to comply with this code  we may be required to discontinue our relationship with that supplier  which could result in a shortfall in our inventory levels 
further  if the supplier s non compliance were publicly disclosed  our customers may refuse to purchase our products 
either of these events could harm our business and results of operations 
our involvement in lawsuits  both now and in the future  could negatively impact our business 
we are currently a defendant in a number of lawsuits  including a class action lawsuit  and we have been involved in a variety of other legal proceedings in the past 
although we intend to vigorously defend the claims against us  if any of the claims in these lawsuits or any future lawsuit are resolved unfavorably to us  we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages or pursue alternative business strategies 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our defense of these actions has resulted  and may continue to result  in substantial costs to us as well as require the significant dedication of management resources 
if we choose to settle any of these lawsuits  the settlement costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash resources and financial condition 
risks related to our class a common stock our stockholders may experience significant dilution 
on june   as part of its private placement of equity securities to institutional and other accredited investors  we issued warrants to acquire million additional shares of class a common stock 
on january   we issued notes which are convertible initially into million shares of class a common stock and warrants which are exercisable initially for million shares of class a common stock 
in each case  the conversion and exercise prices have full ratchet anti dilution protection  which means the conversion or exercise price  as the case may be  will be adjusted from time to time in the event of the issuance of shares of class a common stock or of securities convertible or exercisable into shares of our class a common stock  at prices below the applicable conversion or exercise price 
in addition  upon the closing of the april private placement  we will issue preferred stock which will be initially convertible into million shares of our class a common stock and new warrants which will be initially exercisable into million shares of our class a common stock 
the preferred stock will have customary weighted average anti dilution protection for future stock issuances below the applicable per share conversion price and the new warrants will have customary anti dilution protection for stock splits and similar corporate events 
although certain conversion and exercise restrictions are placed upon the holders of the notes  the warrants  the preferred stock and the new warrants  the issuance of the additional shares of class a common stock will cause our existing stockholders to experience significant dilution in their investment in our company 
in addition  if the cash liquidity issues described in these risk factors require us to obtain additional financing involving the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities  our existing stockholders investment would be further diluted 
such dilution could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline  which could impair our ability to raise additional financing 
our class a common stock could be subject to short selling and other hedging techniques and  if this occurs  the market price of our class a common stock could be adversely affected 
our company s class a common stock could be subject to a number of hedging transactions including the practice of short selling 
short selling  or shorting  occurs when stock is sold which is not owned directly by the seller  instead  the stock is loaned for the sale by a broker dealer to someone who shorts the stock 
in most situations  this is a short term strategy by a seller  and based upon volume  may at times drive stock values down 
based upon a review of the current stock ownership filings with the sec made by our stockholders  we have identified several investment firms that own equity interests in our company 
these firms may actively engage in hedging transactions  including the short selling of our class a common stock 
moreover  a significant percentage of the convertible securities issued in our recent private placement transactions are held by investment firms who may engage such transactions 
any such hedging activities could reduce the value of our current stockholders equity interests in our company at and after the time the hedging transactions have occurred 
we have never paid dividends on our class a common stock and do not plan to do so in the future 
holders of shares of our class a common stock are entitled to receive any dividends that may be declared by our board of directors 
however  we have not paid any cash dividends on our class a common stock and we do not expect to do so in the future 
also  our agreements with our senior lenders and the indenture governing the notes prohibit us from paying dividends to our stockholders 
we intend to retain any future earnings to provide funds for operations of our business 
investors who anticipate the need for dividends from investments should not purchase our class a common stock 
our charter provisions  rights plan and delaware law may have anti takeover effects 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize our board of directors to designate and issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that could differentially and adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock  which could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
in addition  under certain circumstances our board of directors may grant rights to our stockholders under our rights plan 
furthermore  certain provisions of delaware law applicable to our company could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
the possible issuance of preferred stock  the rights granted to stockholders under our rights plan and delaware law could each have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest  making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock and limiting the price that investors might in the future be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
item properties our principal executive offices are located at burbank  foothill ranch  california  with  square feet of leased office and distribution facility space  including  square feet of merchandise handling and storage mezzanine space in the distribution facility and  square feet of office space 
this lease expires on december  the lease allows for one five year option 
we lease all of our stores 
lease terms for our stores typically are years in length and generally contain renewal options 
the leases generally provide for a fixed minimum rental and additional rental based on a percentage of sales once a minimum sales level has been reached 
certain leases include cash reimbursements received from landlords for leasehold improvements and other cash payments received from landlords as lease incentives 
when a lease expires  we generally renew that lease at current market terms 
however  each renewal is based upon an analysis of the individual store s profitability and sales potential 
due to poor performance and or non renewal of a lease  we closed wet seal stores and arden b 
stores during the year ended january  of these closures  were due to natural lease expirations and were related to our previously announced plans to close wet seal stores 
in addition  we closed another wet seal stores by march  in of these stores  we had ceased use of the properties at january  and were preparing the locations for return to the respective landlords 
at the end of fiscal  we had  square feet of leased space for continuing operations  not including our principal executive offices 
the following table sets forth information with respect to store openings and closings since fiscal fiscal years stores open at beginning of year stores acquired during period stores opened during period stores closed during period stores open at end of period we acquired zutopia stores on march  from gymboree  inc includes the closure of zutopia stores in fiscal item legal proceedings between august  and october   six securities class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the central district of california the court  on behalf of persons who purchased our common stock between january  and august  our company and certain of our present and former directors and executives were named as defendants 
the complaints allege violations of section b and a of the exchange act  and rule b of the exchange act  on the grounds that  among other things  we failed to disclose and misrepresented material adverse facts that were known to the defendants or disregarded by them 
on november   the court consolidated the actions and appointed lead plaintiffs and counsel 
on january   the lead plaintiffs filed their consolidated class action complaint with the court  which consolidated all of the previously reported class actions 
the consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants  including our company  violated the federal securities laws by making material misstatements of fact or failing to disclose material facts during the class period  from march to august  concerning its prospects to stem ongoing losses in its wet seal division and return that business to profitability 
the consolidated complaint also alleges that certain former directors and la senza corporation  a canadian company controlled by them  unlawfully utilized material non public information in connection with the sale of our common stock by la senza
