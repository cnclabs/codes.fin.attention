item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion and analysis contains certain statements that are not historical facts  including  among others  those relating to our anticipated financial performance for fiscal and our expected store openings 
such statements are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those discussed in item of this k under risk factors forward looking statements 
information included in this discussion and analysis includes commentary on franchised restaurant units  restaurant sales  same store sales  and average weekly sales volumes 
management believes such sales information is an important measure of our performance  and is useful in assessing consumer acceptance of the buffalo wild wings grill bar concept and the overall health of the concept 
franchise information also provides an understanding of the company s revenues as franchise royalties and fees are based on the opening of franchise units and their sales 
however  franchise sales and same store sales information does not represent sales in accordance with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap  should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to financial information as defined or used by other companies 
on february   the office of the chief accountant of the sec sent a letter to the center for public audit firms of the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  regarding certain lease accounting practices 
the office of the chief accountant concluded that companies were incorrectly accounting for certain lease expenses and that such errors required correction 
in order to make these corrections  a number of companies  including us  would be required to restate previously issued financial statements if the corrections were deemed to be material 
on march   members of our management and our independent registered public accounting firm met with our audit committee to discuss the views expressed by the office of the chief accountant 
during this meeting  management reached the preliminary conclusion that we had not historically deemed the build out periods for restaurants to be rent holidays  but rather had expensed rent beginning as of the commencement of the lease term  which typically is the earlier of the commencement of operations or commencement of the lease term 
accordingly  on march   we issued a press release and filed a form k with the sec announcing that our previously issued financial statements  including those in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  and the related independent public accountants report  and those in our quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended march   june  and september   should no longer be relied upon 
further  we had determined that our unaudited financial results included in our press release issued on february  should no longer be relied upon 
since the march press release  the sec has provided further guidance regarding the accounting for construction period and preopening lease costs 
as a result of this guidance  we adopted an accounting policy to capitalize lease costs during the construction period and adjusted the fourth quarter financial results disclosed in its february  press release  and therefore will not need to restate our prior year financial statements 
overview as of december   we owned and operated and franchised an additional buffalo wild wings grill bar restaurants in states 
of the system wide restaurants  of those restaurants are located in ohio 
the restaurants have elements of both the quick casual and casual dining styles  both of which are part of a growing industry  with consumer spending in the quick casual segment increasing at a rate greater than in quick service or casual dining  and the grill and bar segment generally considered the largest and a growing sub segment of the casual dining industry 
our long term focus is to grow to a national chain of  
table of contents 
index to financial statements locations  with annual unit growth in the next several years  continuing the strategy of developing both company owned and franchised restaurants 
our growth and success depend on several factors and trends 
first  we continue to monitor and react to our cost of goods sold 
the costs of goods sold is difficult to predict  as it ranged to quarter to quarter in  mostly due to the price fluctuation in chicken wings 
we are working to counteract the all time high prices of chicken wings with the introduction of popular new menu items  effective marketing promotions and menu price increases 
we will continue to monitor the cost of fresh chicken wing prices  as it can significantly change our cost of sales and cash flow from company owned restaurants 
we also are exploring purchasing strategies to lessen the severity of cost increases and fluctuations  and are reviewing menu additions and other strategies that may decrease the percentage that fresh chicken wings represent in terms of total restaurant sales 
the chart below illustrates the fluctuation in fresh chicken wing prices from quarter to quarter in the last five years 
logo a second factor is our success in new markets 
in  we do not plan to enter any markets in which we do not already have a presence  although we are opening new corporate restaurants in markets where we already have franchise locations 
we will  however  continue our development efforts in the markets we entered in  including new company owned restaurants in the dallas and denver markets  which have met our expectations  and will focus on improving performance in the atlanta market 
third  we will continue our focus on trends in company owned and franchised same store sales as an indicator of the continued acceptance of our concept by consumers 
we also review the overall trend in average weekly sales as an indicator of our ability to increase the sales volume  and therefore cash flow per location 
we remain committed to high quality operations and guest hospitality  as evidenced by the implementation of our new service style in company owned and franchised restaurants

index to financial statements our revenue is generated by sales at our company owned restaurants  which represented of total revenue in food and nonalcoholic beverages accounted for of restaurant sales 
the remaining of restaurant sales were from alcoholic beverages 
the menu item with the highest sales volume is chicken wings at of total restaurant sales 
royalties and franchise fees received from our franchisees 
we generate cash from the operation of our company owned restaurants and also from franchise royalties and fees 
we highlight the specific costs associated with the operations of our company owned restaurants in the statement of earnings under restaurant operating costs 
nearly all of our depreciation expense relates to assets used by our company owned restaurants 
preopening costs are those costs associated with opening new company owned restaurants and will vary annually based on the number of new locations opened 
restaurant closures and impairment expense is related to company owned restaurants  and includes the write down of poor performing locations  the costs associated with closures of locations and normal asset retirements 
certain other expenses  such as general and administrative  relate to both company owned restaurant and franchising operations 
as a growing company  we review our trend in general and administrative expenses  and are focused on reducing this expense as a percentage of revenue 
we operate on a or week fiscal year ending on the last sunday in december 
our fiscal was a week year 
for the purposes of annual comparisons  unless otherwise noted  we have not adjusted for this difference 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following discussion represents our more critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  although it is not inclusive 
valuation of long lived assets and store closing reserves we review long lived assets quarterly to determine if the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows 
assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified  which is at the restaurant level 
restaurants are included in the impairment analysis after they have been open for months 
we evaluate each long lived asset  including leasehold improvements  equipment and fixtures over its remaining lease term  after considering the potential impact of planned operational improvements and marketing programs 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over its remaining lease term 
if assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment 
during fiscal  and  we recognized   and  respectively  of asset impairment charges 
in addition to the valuation of long lived assets  we also record a store closing reserve when a restaurant is abandoned 
the store closing reserve is subject to significant judgment as accruals are made for lease payments on abandoned leased facilities 
many factors  including the local business environment  other available lease sites  and the willingness of lessors to negotiate lease buyouts are considered in making the accruals 
we estimate

index to financial statements future lease obligations based on these factors and quarterly evaluate the adequacy of the estimated reserve based on current market conditions 
during  we recorded a store closing reserve of  to accrue obligations for an underperforming restaurant that was closed in during  we recorded a reserve of  which included charges of  for a restaurant closed in and an additional charge of  for the restaurant closed in the reconciliation of the store closing reserve for the year ended december   december   and december  is as follows balance dec

certain of these funds are determined based on various quantitative contract terms 
we also receive vendor rebates from certain manufacturers and distributors calculated based upon purchases made by franchisees 
amounts expected to be received from vendors are recognized as a reduction of inventoriable costs as product purchases are made from vendors 
amounts that represent a reimbursement of costs incurred  such as advertising  are recorded as a reduction of the related expense 
we record an estimate of earned vendor rebates and allowances that are calculated based upon monthly purchases 
we generally receive payment from vendors approximately days from the end of a month for that month s purchases 
during fiscal  and  vendor allowances were recorded as a reduction in inventoriable costs and cost of sales was reduced by million  million  and million  respectively 
revenue recognition franchise operations our franchise agreements have terms ranging from to years 
these agreements also convey extension terms of five or years depending on contract terms and if certain conditions are met 
we provide training  preopening assistance and restaurant operating assistance in exchange for area development fees  franchise fees and royalties of of the franchised restaurant s sales 
franchise fee revenue from individual franchise sales is recognized upon the opening of the restaurant when all our material obligations and initial services to be provided by us have been performed 
area development fees are dependent upon the number of restaurants

liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity and capital requirements have been for new restaurant construction  remodeling and maintaining our existing company owned restaurants  working capital and other general business needs 
our main sources of liquidity and capital are cash flows from operations and the issuance of common stock through an initial public offering in november the cash and marketable securities balance at the fiscal year ended was million 
we invest our cash balances in debt securities with the focus on protection of principal  adequate liquidity and maximization of after tax returns

net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net earnings adjusted for non cash expenses and an increase in unearned franchise fees  accounts payable  and accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and income tax receivables 
the increase in unearned franchise fees was due to a number of area development and franchise agreements sold but for which the restaurants had not yet opened 
the increase in accounts payable was due to an increased number of invoices as a result of the larger restaurant base 
the increase in accrued expenses was due primarily to higher incentive compensation costs resulting from company performance  higher professional fees resulting from sox implementation  and a higher gift card liability due to strong fourth quarter gift card sales

net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net earnings adjusted for non cash expenses and an increase in accrued expenses  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and the timing of income tax payments which reduced income taxes payable 
the increase in accrued expenses was due primarily to higher incentive compensation costs resulting from additional corporate headcount and improved company performance

our liquidity is impacted by minimum cash payment commitments resulting from operating lease obligations for our restaurants and our corporate offices

some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds 
except for one restaurant building  we do not currently own any of the properties on which our restaurants operate and therefore do not have the ability to enter into sale leaseback transactions as a potential source of cash

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to our cash and cash equivalents 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by weather  production  availability and other factors outside our control 
we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food product risks 
we negotiate directly with independent suppliers for our supply of food and paper products 
we use members of unipro food services  inc  a national cooperative of independent food distributors  to distribute these products from the suppliers to our restaurants 
we have minimum purchase requirements with some of our vendors  but the terms of the contracts and nature of the products are such that our purchase requirements do not create a market risk 
the primary food product used by company owned and franchised restaurants is fresh chicken wings 
we purchase fresh chicken wings based on current market prices that are subject to weekly fluctuation 
a material increase in fresh chicken wing costs may adversely affect our operating results 
fresh chicken wing prices are near all time highs  with prices as of the end of february at per pound compared to the average per pound price of in unless there is a reduction in the price of fresh chicken wings  or we are able to successfully adjust menu prices or menu mix or otherwise make operational adjustments to account for the high wing prices  our operating results could be adversely affected 
fresh chicken wings accounted for approximately   and of our cost of sales in   and  respectively  with an annual average price per pound of   and  respectively 
if we had experienced an additional increase in fresh chicken wing costs during  restaurant cost of sales would have increased by approximately million for fiscal additional information related to chicken wing prices is included in item under results of operations 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor  and restaurant operating costs 
substantial increases in these costs could impact operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along through higher menu prices 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable federal and state minimum wages  and increases in the minimum wage rates could directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years 
financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments 
the counterparties to the instruments consist of government agencies and various major corporations of investment grade credit standing 
the company does not believe there is a significant risk of non performance by these counterparties because of company limitations as to acceptable investment vehicles
