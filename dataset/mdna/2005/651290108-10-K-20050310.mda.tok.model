 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  on january  sfas no 
requires us to record all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on our balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
for all periods prior to january   we accounted for commodity price hedging instruments in accordance with sfas no 
the cumulative effect of adoption of sfas no 
is a reduction in net income of million  or per diluted share  and is shown as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  on january   we began assessing hedge effectiveness based on the total changes in cash flows on our collar and floor contracts as described by derivative implementation group dig issue g  cash flow hedges assessing and measuring the effectiveness of a purchased option used in a cash flow hedge 
accordingly  we elected to prospectively record subsequent changes in the fair value of our collar and floor contracts other than contracts that are part of three way collar contracts see note  commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities  to our consolidated financial statements  including changes associated with time value  in accumulated other comprehensive income loss commodity derivates 
gains or losses on these collar and floor contracts will be reclassified out of other comprehensive income loss and into earnings when the forecasted sale of production occurs 
the expense recorded in is associated with the settlement of collar and floor contracts during the year ended december  and primarily reflects the reversal of time value gains of approximately million recognized in earnings in prior to the adoption of dig issue g had we applied dig issue g from the january  adoption date of sfas no 
 our income statement caption commodity derivative income expense would have only reflected million and million of expense in and  respectively  representing the ineffective portion of our hedges 
as a result  net income would have increased by million in and decreased by million in on september   we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  newfield exploration australia ltd  that held all of our australian assets

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  on january  this statement changed the method of accounting for expected future costs associated with our obligation to perform site reclamation  dismantle facilities and plug and abandon wells 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no

 revenue recognition in financial statements  effective january  sab no 
required us to report crude oil inventory associated with our australian offshore operations at the lower of cost or market  which was a change from our historical policy of recording such inventory at market value on the balance sheet date  net of estimated costs to sell 
the cumulative effect of the change from the acquisition date of our australian operations in july through december  was a reduction in net income of million  or per diluted share  and is shown as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  development and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties 
our domestic areas of operation include the gulf of mexico  the onshore gulf coast  the anadarko and arkoma basins of the mid continent and the uinta basin of the rocky mountains 
internationally  we are active offshore malaysia  in the north sea  offshore brazil and in china s bohai bay 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
oil and gas prices 
prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely 
oil and gas prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce  and the accounting for our oil and gas activities 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production to reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
reserve replacement 
most of our producing properties have declining production rates 
as a result  to maintain and grow our production and cash flow we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production 
substantial capital expenditures are required to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
significant estimates 
we believe the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates we must make in connection with the preparation of our financial statements are the quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves  the timing of future drilling  development and abandonment activities  the cost of these activities in the future  the fair value of the assets and liabilities of acquired companies  and the value of our derivative positions 
other factors 
please see other factors affecting our business and financial results in this item for a more detailed discussion of a number of other factors that affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations we completed several significant acquisitions during the second and third quarters of as described in more detail in the relevant discussions below  these acquisitions had a meaningful impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
in may  we entered into pscs with malaysia s state owned oil company in partnership with its exploration and production subsidiary 
in july  we acquired producing oil and gas properties in oklahoma 
also in july  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of denbury offshore  inc  the subsidiary of denbury resources inc that held substantially all of its gulf of mexico assets 
in august  we acquired inland resources inc these acquisitions were financed through cash on hand  borrowings under our credit arrangements and offerings of our common stock and 
table of contents our senior subordinated notes due see note  acquisitions  note  debt  and note  common stock activity to our consolidated financial statements set forth in item in this report for a full discussion of these activities 
on september   we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  newfield exploration australia ltd  which held all of our australian assets 
as a result of the sale  the historical results of our australian operations are reflected on our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
please see note  discontinued operations  to our consolidated financial statements 
except where noted  discussions in this report relate to our continuing activities 
revenues 
all of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production  which is net of the effects of the settlement of qualifying hedging contracts associated with our production 
settlement of our three way collar contracts  which do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 has no effect on our reported revenues 
our revenues may vary significantly from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices or production volumes 
revenues for reached a record billion and were higher than revenues due to a substantial increase in natural gas and crude oil prices and a increase in production primarily resulting from the acquisitions mentioned above and our acquisition of primary natural resources pnr in september year ended december  production united states natural gas bcf oil and condensate mbbls total bcfe international natural gas bcf oil and condensate mbbls total bcfe total natural gas bcf oil and condensate mbbls total bcfe average realized prices united states natural gas per mcf oil and condensate per bbl natural gas equivalent per mcfe international natural gas per mcf oil and condensate per bbl natural gas equivalent per mcfe total natural gas per mcf oil and condensate per bbl natural gas equivalent per mcfe represents volumes sold regardless of when produced 
average realized prices include the effects of hedging other than our three way collar contracts  which do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
had we included the effects of these contracts  our average realized price for total natural gas would have been per mcf and our average realized price for total oil and condensate would have been per bbl for no three way contracts were settled in or 
table of contents production 
our total oil and gas production stated on a natural gas equivalent basis increased over the increase primarily was the result of our pnr acquisition in september  the oklahoma property and denbury offshore acquisitions in july  the inland acquisition in august and successful drilling efforts 
in addition  liftings in malaysia began during the third quarter of these increases were partially offset by shut in production of approximately bcfe during the third quarter of in the gulf of mexico due to hurricane ivan and natural field declines 
our total oil and gas production increased over primarily as a result of our acquisition of eex corporation in november  other small acquisitions and successful drilling efforts 
in addition  production was reduced by our decision to voluntarily curtail approximately one bcfe of production in the first quarter of that year in response to low commodity prices and by the shut in of four bcfe of production in the second half of that year in response to storms in the gulf of mexico 
natural gas 
our natural gas production increased when compared to the increase primarily was the result of the acquisitions mentioned above and successful drilling efforts 
the increase partially offset the shut in due to hurricane ivan described above and natural field declines 
our natural gas production was higher when compared to the increase primarily was the result of our acquisition of eex 
our development drilling programs in south texas  the mid continent and the gulf of mexico also were major contributors to our production growth 
in addition  production was reduced by the voluntarily curtailment and the shut ins described above 
crude oil and condensate 
our oil and condensate production increased when compared to primarily due to initial production and liftings in malaysia and the acquisition of inland in the third quarter of our domestic oil production increased primarily as a result of the inland acquisition  partially offset by natural field declines 
our oil production increased when compared to primarily due to development drilling programs in the us and the acquisition of eex in november  which were partially offset by natural field declines in all producing regions 
effects of hedging on realized prices 
the following table presents information about the effects of our hedging program on realized prices 
average realized prices ratio of hedged to with without non hedged hedge hedge price natural gas year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  crude oil and condensate year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  average realized prices in this column do not include the effects of our three way collar contracts  which do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
had we included the effects of these contracts  our average realized price for natural gas for would have been per mcf and our average realized price for oil and condensate for would have been per bbl 
no three way contracts were settled in or the ratio is determined by dividing the realized price which includes the effects of hedging other than three way collar contracts by the price that otherwise would have been realized without hedging activities 
operating expenses 
we are a growth oriented company 
as such  our proved reserves and production have grown steadily since our founding 
naturally  our operating expenses have increased with our growth 
as a result  we believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our regularly recurring operating expenses from period to period is on a unit of production  or per mcfe  basis

our total regularly recurring operating expenses  stated on an mcfe basis  increased over domestic operations 
our domestic regularly recurring operating expenses for  stated on an mcfe basis  increased over the same period of this increase was primarily related to the following items lease operating expense loe  on an mcfe basis  increased in as a result of higher operating costs and natural field declines in our gulf of mexico properties 
production and other taxes  on an mcfe basis  increased in due to higher commodity prices and an increase in our production volumes subject to production taxes

the increase was primarily due to our growing workforce from acquisitions and an increase in incentive compensation expense as a result of the increase in our profitability over during  we capitalized million of direct internal costs as compared to million in international operations

see gas sales obligation settlement and redemption of trust preferred securities 
not meaningful 
our total regularly recurring operating expenses  stated on an mcfe basis  increased over the increase was primarily related to the following items loe on an mcfe basis for increased in large part due to the addition of higher cost onshore properties from the eex acquisition and a higher level of workover activity in production taxes on an mcfe basis increased in due to higher commodity prices 
additionally  a greater percentage of our production was onshore and subject to production taxes in as compared to dd a excluding furniture  fixtures and equipment for was per mcfe versus per mcfe for our adoption of sfas no 
on january  see cumulative effect of 
table of contents change in accounting principle adoption of sfas no 
resulted in per mcfe of the increase 
the remainder of the increase resulted from the increased cost of reserve additions during the year 
g a expense for  on an mcfe basis  before capitalized direct internal costs  increased per mcfe  or 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees as a result of our growth and an increase in incentive compensation expense due to the significant increase in earnings 
the increase was offset by an increase in capitalized direct internal costs 
during  we capitalized million of direct internal costs compared to million in ceiling test writedown 
in november  we announced that our cumbria prospect in the north sea was a dry hole 
under full cost accounting  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized in cost centers on a country by country basis 
because the unamortized costs exceeded the full cost ceiling  we were required to recognize a ceiling test writedown of million in impairment of floating production system and pipelines 
as a result of our acquisition of eex in november  we own a interest in a floating production system  some offshore pipelines and a processing facility located at the end of the pipelines in shallow water 
the floating production system is a combination deepwater drilling rig and processing facility capable of simultaneous drilling and production operations 
at the time of acquisition  we estimated the fair market value of these assets to be million 
these infrastructure assets are not currently in service and we do not have a specific use for them in our offshore operations 
since their acquisition  we had undertaken to sell these assets 
in december  when what we believed was the last commercial opportunity for sale was not realized  we determined that there was no active market for these assets 
as a result  in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of under the caption impairment of floating production system and pipelines on our consolidated statement of income 
gas sales obligation settlement 
pursuant to a gas forward sales contract entered into in  eex committed to deliver approximately bcf of production to a third party in exchange for proceeds of million 
when we acquired eex  we recorded a liability of million  which represented the then current market value of approximately bcf of remaining reserves subject to the contract 
we accounted for the obligation under the gas sales contract as debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
in march  pursuant to a settlement agreement  the gas sales contract and all related agreements were terminated in exchange for a payment by us of approximately million 
we recognized a loss of million under the caption gas sales obligation settlement and redemption of securities on our consolidated statement of income as a result of the settlement 
redemption of trust preferred securities 
in june  we redeemed all of our outstanding convertible trust preferred securities for an aggregate redemption price of approximately million  including million of optional redemption premium 
this premium and million of unamortized offering costs which were being amortized over the year life of the securities were expensed under the caption gas sales obligation settlement and redemption of securities on our consolidated statement of income 
we financed the redemption with the net proceeds approximately million from the issuance and sale of million shares of our common stock in may and borrowings under our credit arrangements

the components of gross interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended december  are as follows year ended december  in millions credit arrangements senior notes interest rate swaps senior subordinated notes secured notes gas sales obligation other gross interest expense average outstanding borrowings under our credit arrangements during were about higher than during because we financed the cash consideration for our oklahoma property and denbury offshore acquisitions approximately million primarily with borrowings under our credit arrangements 
the weighted average interest rate also was slightly higher in average outstanding borrowings under our credit arrangements during were about more than during because of borrowings to repay or settle the eex obligations described below and to finance our september acquisition of pnr approximately million 
the weighted average interest rate was slightly lower in compared to during  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with respect to million principal amount of our senior notes due and million principal amount of our senior notes due these swap agreements provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments 
in august  we issued million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due to finance the repayment of eex obligations due at the closing and transaction costs 
because the proceeds were held in escrow pending closing  interest that accrued prior to the closing approximately million was capitalized as a cost of the transaction 
we issued million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due in august in connection with our acquisition of inland later that month 
in connection with our acquisition of eex  we also assumed million principal amount of secured notes interest rate of per annum and million under a gas forward sales contract effective interest rate of per annum 
we repurchased million principal amount of secured notes in december during  we repurchased or repaid million principal amount of secured notes 
interest expense for includes million of premiums paid in connection with repurchases 
in january  we repurchased the remainder of the secured notes 
we settled the gas forward sales contract in march the repurchase of secured notes and the settlement of the gas sales obligation were financed with borrowings under our credit arrangements 

table of contents capitalized interest 
we capitalize interest with respect to unproved properties 
interest capitalized in increased over primarily due to an increase in our unproved property base as a result of the inland acquisition 
capitalized interest increased during because of our increased unproved property base resulting from the eex acquisition 
distributions on preferred securities 
we redeemed all of our outstanding trust preferred securities in june with the net proceeds from an offering of our common stock and borrowings under our credit arrangements

the unrealized loss associated with our cash flow hedges reflects the reversal of the time value gains that were recognized in see note  commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities  to our consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this report 
the unrealized loss associated with our three way collar contracts represents changes in the fair market value of our open three way collar contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting 
taxes 
the effective tax rates for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for all three years was more than the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes associated with income from various states 
estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices  estimates of the timing and amount of future production and estimates of future operating expenses and capital costs 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle adoption of sfas no 
we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  as of january  this statement changed the method of accounting for expected future costs associated with our obligation to perform site reclamation  dismantle facilities and plug and abandon wells 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded a million increase in the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties and an initial asset retirement obligation  or aro  of million 
additionally  we recognized an after tax gain of million the after tax amount by which additional capitalized costs  net of accumulated depreciation  exceeded the initial aro  including in each case discontinued operations as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies accounting for asset retirement obligations  to our consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this report 

table of contents results of discontinued operations as a result of the sale of our australian operations in september  the historical financial position  results of operations and cash flow of these operations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
the results of our australian operations for each of the years in the two year period ended december  are summarized in note  discontinued operations  to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow production and cash flow 
we add new reserves and grow production through successful exploration and development drilling and the acquisition of properties 
these activities require substantial capital expenditures 
historically  we have successfully grown our reserve base and production  resulting in net long term growth in our cash flow from operating activities 
fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for short term changes in our cash flow from operating activities 
we establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year based on expected cash flow from operations for that year 
in the past  we often have revised our capital budget upward several times during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling 
because of the nature of the properties we own  a substantial majority of our capital budget is discretionary 
credit arrangements 
on march   we entered into a reserve based revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase manhattan bank  as agent 
the banks participating in the facility have committed to lend us up to million 
the amount available under the facility is subject to a calculated borrowing base determined by banks holding of the aggregate commitments 
the calculated borrowing base is then reduced by the principal amount of any outstanding senior notes million at february  and of the principal amount of any outstanding senior subordinated notes a reduction of million at february  
the borrowing base is redetermined at least semi annually and  after all required adjustments  exceeded the facility amount by million and therefore was limited to million at february  no assurances can be given that the banks will not determine in the future that the borrowing base should be reduced 
the facility contains restrictions on the payment of dividends and the incurrence of debt as well as other customary covenants and restrictions 
the facility matures on march  we also have money market lines of credit with various banks in an amount limited by our credit facility to million 
at february   we had outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under our credit facility of million and million  respectively  and no outstanding borrowings under our money market lines 
consequently  at february   we had approximately million of available capacity under our credit arrangements 
working capital 
our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements 
generally  we use excess cash to pay down borrowings under our credit arrangements 
as a result  we often have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital 
we had a working capital deficit of million as of december  this compares to working capital deficits of million at the end of and million at the end of our working capital deficit includes million in asset retirement obligations compared to million in asset retirement obligations in see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies accounting for asset retirement obligations  to our consolidated financial statements and a higher accrued employee incentive payable than in due to an increase in our net income and several deferred acquisition payments related to our acquisitions see note  accrued liabilities  to our consolidated financial statements 
our working capital also is affected by fluctuations in the fair value of our commodity derivative instruments 
our working capital deficit included an million secured note payment due january and accrued severance costs associated with our acquisition of eex 

table of contents cash flows from continuing operations 
cash flows from operations is primarily affected by production and commodity prices  net of the effects of hedging 
our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital 
we sell substantially all of our natural gas and oil production under floating market contracts 
however  we enter into hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we typically receive the cash associated with accrued oil and gas sales within days of production 
as a result  cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate  but cash flows from operations is impacted by changes in working capital and is not affected by dd a or writedowns 
our net cash flows from continuing operations were million in  a increase over the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to a increase in our realized oil and gas prices on a natural gas equivalent basis and a increase in production volumes due to our acquisitions during see results of operations above 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased million due to the increased levels of development and exploration activities in progress at year end  our growth from acquisitions during and higher commodity prices in effect at december  our net cash flows from continuing operations were million in  a increase over the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to a increase in oil and gas prices on a natural gas equivalent basis and a increase in production volumes as a result of our acquisition of eex 
see results of operations above 
a substantial portion of the net increase of million in other current assets in is related to a receivable for overpaid federal income taxes for accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased million 
accounts payable fluctuate from period to period depending on the level of development and exploration activities in progress and the timing of payments made by us to vendors and other operators 
in  other liabilities decreased as a result of payments made by us in satisfaction of liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisition of eex 
capital expenditures 
our capital spending was  million  nearly three times our capital spending of million 
this included million allocated for financial accounting purposes to the oil and gas properties acquired in our million purchase of inland 
this also included approximately million for acquisitions in oklahoma and the gulf of mexico 
during  we also invested million in domestic development  million in domestic exploration  million in other domestic leasehold activity and million internationally 
the international capital spending included million related to the acquisition of our malaysian pscs 
capital spending in was million  a decrease of from capital spending of million 
in  we invested million in domestic development  million in domestic exploration  million in other domestic leasehold activity and million internationally 
the amount included approximately million in acquisitions 
the largest component of spending was the million acquisition of eex in late in  we also invested million in domestic development  million in domestic exploration  million in other domestic acquisitions and million internationally 

table of contents we have budgeted million for capital spending in  excluding acquisitions 
approximately of the budget is allocated to the gulf of mexico including the traditional shelf  the deep shelf and deepwater  to the onshore us and the remainder to international projects 
we anticipate that our current capital expenditure budget for will be fully funded from cash flows from operations 
to the extent that cash receipts during the year are slower than capital needs  we will make up the shortfall with borrowings under our credit arrangements 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors  including the extent to which proved properties are acquired  drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions and the prices and availability of goods and services 
we continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities  however  the timing  size and purchase price of acquisitions are unpredictable 
historically  we have completed several acquisitions of varying sizes each year 
depending on the timing of an acquisition  we may spend additional capital during the year of the acquisition for drilling and development activities on the acquired properties 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december  were million compared to million of net cash flows used in financing activities for the same period of during  we borrowed a net million under our credit arrangements  sold million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million  or per share  and issued million of senior subordinated notes 
during  we borrowed a net million under our credit arrangements  repaid or repurchased million principal amount of secured notes  settled our obligation under a gas sales contract  million of which was accounted for as debt  sold million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million  or per share  and redeemed all of our outstanding trust preferred securities for an aggregate redemption price of approximately million

the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes limits our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  make restricted payments  pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock  make certain investments  create liens  make certain dispositions of assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  and engage in mergers  consolidations and certain sales of assets 
commitments under joint operating agreements 
the oil and gas industry operates in many instances through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements  and our operations are no exception 
typically  the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts  such as drilling contracts  for the benefit of all joint venture partners 
through the joint operating agreement  the non operators reimburse  and in some cases advance  the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator 
these obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis 
the joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator in the event that the non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations 
occasionally  the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses  frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses

under the terms of our malaysian psc s  we have committed to spend during the next five years on shallow water block pm and million during the next seven years on deepwater block c 
the consideration for our interest in pm also includes our agreement to pay million in the future as reimbursement for sunk costs 
employee benefit plan obligations 
in  we contributed million to our funded pension plan and million to our unfunded post retirement medical plan 
in  we anticipate making a contribution of million to our unfunded post retirement medical plan and a minimal contribution to our funded pension plan 
contributions to our funded plan increase the plan assets while contributions to our unfunded plan are made to fund current period benefit payments 
future contributions to our funded pension plan will be affected by actuarial assumptions  market performance and individual year funding decisions

oil and gas hedging we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production for the next months as part of our risk management program 
in the case of acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
we use hedging to reduce price volatility  help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions 
approximately of our production was subject to hedge positions including both contracts that qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 

in  of our production was subject to hedge positions  compared to in while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
in addition  the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk 
substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the nymex 
we believe there is no material basis risk with respect to our natural gas price hedging contracts because substantially all of our hedged natural gas production is sold at market prices that historically have had a high positive correlation to the settlement price 
because substantially all of our oil production is sold at current market prices that historically have had a high positive correlation to the nymex west texas intermediate wti price  we believe that we have no material basis risk with respect to these transactions 
the price we receive for our gulf coast production typically averages about per barrel below the wti price 
the price we receive for our production in the rocky mountains averages about per barrel below the wti price 
oil production from the mid continent typically sells at a per barrel discount to wti 
oil production from malaysia typically sells at tapis  or about even with wti 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
at december   bank of montreal  jpmorgan chase  barclays bank plc and j aron company were the counterparties with respect to of our future hedged production 
such contracts are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
in  we began to utilize three way collar derivative contracts as part of our risk management program 
although our three way collar contracts are effective as economic hedges of our commodity price exposure  they do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
please see the discussion and tables in note  commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities  to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the accounting applicable to our hedging program and a listing of open contracts as of december  and the fair value of those contracts as of that date

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
we discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee 
see results of operations above and note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
for discussion purposes  we have divided our significant policies into four categories 
set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category 
we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method 
this method of accounting requires the following significant estimates quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves  costs withheld from amortization  and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties 
accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company 

table of contents accounting for stock based compensation may be accounted for under one of two available methods 
accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the value of derivative positions 
oil and gas activities accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
the most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment 
the successful efforts method requires exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs 
both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities 
impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value  while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves  using period end prices and costs and a discount rate 
full cost method 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers the amortization base that are established on a country by country basis 
such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells  dry hole costs  lease acquisition costs and delay rentals 
capitalized costs also include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our oil and gas activities 
interest costs related to unproved properties also are capitalized 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties  plus an estimate of our future development and abandonment costs  are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves 
amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
proved oil and gas reserves 
our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
changes in oil and gas prices  operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves 
all reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff 
as a requirement of our credit facility  independent reserve engineers prepare separate reserve reports with respect to properties holding at least of our proved reserves 
for december   the independent reserve engineers reports covered properties representing of our proved reserves and for such properties  the reserves were within of the reserves we reported for such properties 

table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves are revised upward  earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense 
likewise  if reserves are revised downward  earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown 
to increase our domestic dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would require a decrease in our estimated proved reserves at december  of approximately bcfe 
due to the relatively small size of our international full cost pools in the uk and malaysia  any decrease in reserves associated with the respective country s full cost pool would significantly increase the dd a rate in that country 
however  as our international operations represent less than of our consolidated production for  a change in our international dd a expense would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations 
full cost ceiling limitation 
under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess 
if required  it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods 
the ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
however  the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant 
however  we may not be subject to a writedown if prices increase subsequent to the end of a quarter in which a writedown might otherwise be required 
the full cost ceiling test impairment calculations also take into consideration the effects of hedging 
given the volatility of natural gas and oil prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves will change in the near term 
if natural gas and oil prices decline  even if for only a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
at december   the ceiling with respect to our oil and gas properties in the us and malaysia exceeded the net capitalized costs of those properties by approximately billion and million  respectively 
at december   the net capitalized costs of our properties in the uk were written down to the present value of the estimated future net revenues from our uk proved reserves plus the fair value of unevaluated properties 
costs withheld from amortization 
unevaluated costs are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties associated with these costs 
the costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and seismic data  wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base 
leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established 
if a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
in addition  a portion of incurred if not previously included in the amortization base and future development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization 
to qualify  a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development eg  the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled 
incurred and future costs are allocated between completed and future work 
any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated 
our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time 
table of contents based on several factors  including our drilling plans  availability of capital  project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage 
at december   our domestic full cost pool had approximately million of costs excluded from the amortization base  including million associated with development costs for our deepwater gulf of mexico project known as glider  located at green canyon at december   capital costs not subject to amortization include million related to our acquisition of inland 
due to the significant size of the monument butte field  acquired in the inland transaction  evaluation of the entire amount will require a number of years 
because the application of the full cost ceiling test at december  resulted in a significant excess of the cost center ceiling over the carrying value of our domestic oil and gas properties  inclusion of some or all of our unevaluated property costs in our amortization base  without adding any associated reserves  would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown 
however  our future dd a rate would increase to the extent such costs are transferred without any associated reserves 
future development and abandonment costs 
future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment 
future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location  type of production structure  water depth  reservoir depth and characteristics  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
we review our assumptions and estimates of future development and future abandonment costs on an annual basis 
the accounting for future abandonment costs changed on january  with the adoption of sfas no 
this new standard requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
see results of operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principal adoption of sfas no 
above 
holding all other factors constant  if our estimate of future abandonment and development costs is revised upward  earnings would decrease due to higher dd a expense 
likewise  if these estimates are revised downward  earnings would increase due to lower dd a expense 
to increase our domestic dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would require an increase in the present value of our estimated future abandonment and development costs at december  of approximately million 
allocation of purchase price in business combinations as part of our growth strategy  we actively pursue the acquisition of oil and gas properties 
the purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date  which may occur many months after the announcement date 
therefore  while the consideration to be paid may be fixed  the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date 
our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties 
to the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired  we are required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill 
as the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments  the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain 
the value allocated to the recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under full cost ceiling limitation above 

table of contents effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  under which goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
rather  goodwill of each reporting unit is tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in making this assessment  we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections and anticipated cash flows 
as there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment  there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated 
if it is overstated  such impairment would reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill 
we elected to make december our annual assessment date 
stock based compensation in accordance with current accounting standards  there are two alternative methods that can be used to account for stock based compensation 
the first method the intrinsic value method recognizes compensation cost as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
under the second method the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
currently  we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method 
however  in note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation  to our consolidated financial statements we have provided tabular information for each of the years in the three year period ended december  that compares our net income and earnings per share as reported and on a pro forma basis as if we had used the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
we will be required to adopt the fair value method in see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation  to our consolidated financial statements 
commodity derivative activities we utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future natural gas and oil production 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next months 
in the case of acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
except for our three way collar contracts  our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting 
under the accounting rules  we designate these derivatives as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and natural gas production 
to the extent that changes in the fair values of these derivatives offset changes in the expected cash flows from our forecasted production  such amounts are not included in our consolidated results of operations 
instead  they are recorded directly to stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced and sold 
to the extent the change in the fair value of the derivative exceeds the change in the expected cash flows from the forecasted production  the change is recorded in income in the period in which it occurs 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting such as three way collar contracts see note  commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities  to our consolidated financial statements are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize all changes in the fair value of these contracts on our consolidated statement of income in the period in which the change occurs 
in determining the amounts to be recorded  we are required to estimate the fair values of both the derivative and the associated hedged production at its physical location 
where necessary  we adjust nymex prices to other regional delivery points using our own estimates of future regional prices 
our estimates are based upon various factors that include closing prices on the nymex  over the counter quotations  volatility and the time value of options 
the calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option pricing model 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the 
table of contents hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts  regional price differences and interest rates 
we periodically validate our valuations using independent  third party quotations 
new accounting standards in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
this pronouncement requires companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities to include an estimate of future asset retirement costs to be incurred as a result of future development activities on proved reserves in their calculation of dd a expense 
it also requires full cost companies to exclude any cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations from their full cost ceiling test calculation 
in addition  it requires specific disclosures regarding the impact of asset retirement obligations on oil and gas producing activities  ceiling test calculations and depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations 
we will adopt the provisions of this pronouncement in the first quarter of since our adoption of sfas no 
 we have included the asset retirement obligation as a reduction of our net capitalized costs in the determination of our full cost ceiling test calculation 
prospectively  we will calculate our full cost ceiling test in accordance with this pronouncement 
we have calculated our dd a expense in accordance with sab since our adoption of sfas no 
consequently  the adoption of sab will have no immediate effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no

r on our financial statements 
regulation we are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulation 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties  and taxation 
under these laws  we could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages 
failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs 
any such liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
federal regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas 
historically  the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to several laws enacted by congress and the regulations promulgated under these laws by the ferc 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which gas could be sold 
congress removed all price and non price 
table of contents controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  congress could  however  reenact price controls in the future 
our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability  terms and cost of transportation 
the price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
from to the present  several major regulatory changes have been implemented by congress and the ferc that affect the economics of natural gas production  transportation and sales 
in addition  the ferc is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry  most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies  that remain subject to the ferc s jurisdiction 
these initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances 
the stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light handed regulation 
the ultimate impact of the complex rules and regulations issued by the ferc since cannot be predicted 
in addition  some aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial and ferc final decisions 
we cannot predict what further action the ferc will take on these matters 
some of the ferc s more recent proposals may  however  adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines 
we do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
the outer continental shelf lands act  or ocsla  requires that all pipelines operating on or across the shelf provide open access  non discriminatory service 
there are currently no regulations implemented by the ferc under its ocsla authority on gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its natural gas act jurisdiction 
the mms has asked for comments on whether it should implement regulations under its ocsla authority on gatherers and other entities to ensure open and non discriminatory access on gathering systems and production facilities on the shelf 
we have no way of knowing whether the mms will proceed with implementing regulations of this nature  however we do not believe that any ferc or mms action taken under ocsla will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before congress  the ferc and the courts 
the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated  therefore  there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the ferc and congress will continue 
federal regulation of sales and transportation of crude oil 
our sales of crude oil and condensate are currently not regulated and are made at market prices 
in a number of instances  however  the ability to transport and sell such products are dependent on pipelines whose rates  terms and conditions of service are subject to ferc jurisdiction under the interstate commerce act 
certain regulations implemented by the ferc in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines 
however  we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other natural gas producers 
federal leases 
the majority of our us operations are located on federal oil and gas leases  which are administered by the mms 
these leases are issued through competitive bidding  contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed mms regulations and orders pursuant to ocsla which are subject to change by the mms 
for offshore operations  lessees must obtain mms approval for exploration plans and development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations 
in addition to permits required from other agencies such as the coast guard  the army corps of engineers and the environmental protection agency  lessees must obtain a permit from the mms prior to the commencement of drilling 
the mms has promulgated regulations requiring offshore production facilities located on the shelf to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications 
the mms also has regulations restricting the flaring or venting of natural gas  and has proposed to amend such regulations to prohibit the flaring of liquid hydrocarbons and oil without prior authorization 
similarly  the 
table of contents mms has promulgated other regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the removal of all production facilities 
to cover the various obligations of lessees on the shelf  the mms generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met 
the cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other surety can be obtained in all cases 
we are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements of the mms 
under certain circumstances  the mms may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the mms regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases provide that the mms will collect royalties based upon the market value of oil produced from federal leases 
on may   the mms issued a final rule that changed certain components of its valuation procedures for the calculation of royalties owed for crude oil sales 
the changes include changing the valuation basis for transactions not at arm s length from spot to nymex prices adjusted for locality and quality differentials  and clarifying the treatment of transactions under a joint operating agreement 
we believe that the rule will not have a material effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
state and local regulation of drilling and production 
we own interests in properties located onshore louisiana  texas  new mexico and oklahoma 
we also own interests in properties in the state waters offshore texas and louisiana 
these states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring  among other things  permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells  and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilling and the plugging and abandonment of wells 
the laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters  including the handling and disposing of waste materials  the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells which may be drilled  unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells 
some states prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas 
environmental regulations 
our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations  or the issuance of injunctive relief 
environmental laws and regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
both onshore and offshore drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and  in certain areas  has been restricted 
to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general  our business and prospects could be adversely affected 
the oil pollution act  or opa  imposes regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in us waters 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility  vessel or pipeline  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
opa assigns strict  joint and several liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages 
while liability limits apply in some circumstances  a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operating regulation  or if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup 
even if applicable  the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs  plus up to million in other damages for offshore facilities and up to million for onshore facilities 
few defenses exist to the liability imposed by opa 
failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party to administrative  civil or criminal enforcement actions 
opa also requires operators in the gulf of mexico to demonstrate to the mms that they possess available financial resources that are sufficient to pay for certain costs that may be incurred in responding 
table of contents to an oil spill 
under opa and implementing mms regulations  responsible parties are required to demonstrate that they possess financial resources sufficient to pay for environmental cleanup and restoration costs of at least million for an oil spill in state waters and at least million for an oil spill in federal waters 
since we currently have extensive operations in federal waters  we currently provide a total of million in financial assurance to mms 
in addition to opa  our discharges to waters of the us are further limited by the federal clean water act  or cwa  and analogous state laws 
the cwa prohibits any discharge into waters of the united states except in compliance with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies 
failure to comply with the cwa  including discharge limits on permits issued pursuant to the cwa  may also result in administrative  civil or criminal enforcement actions 
the opa and cwa also require the preparation of oil spill response plans and spill prevention  control and countermeasure or spcc plans 
we have such plans in existence and are currently amending these plans or  as necessary  developing new spcc plans that will satisfy new spcc plan certification and implementation requirements that become effective in february and august  respectively 
ocsla authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the shelf 
specific design and operational standards may apply to vessels  rigs  platforms  vehicles and structures operating or located on the shelf 
violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to ocsla can result in substantial administrative  civil and criminal penalties  as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases 
the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  generally regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
although rcra specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids  produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  development or production of crude oil  natural gas or geothermal energy  the us environmental protection agency  also known as the epa and state agencies may regulate these wastes as solid wastes 
moreover  ordinary industrial wastes  such as paint wastes  waste solvents  laboratory wastes and waste oils  may be regulated as hazardous waste 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  also known as the superfund law  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
such responsible persons may be subject to joint and several liability under the superfund law for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
we currently own or lease onshore properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of years 
many of these onshore properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control 
these properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to the superfund law  rcra and analogous state laws  and we potentially could be required to investigate and remediate such properties  including soil or groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators  or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable us federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
our foreign operations are potentially subject to similar governmental controls and restrictions relating to the environment and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with any such foreign requirements 
there can be no assurance  however  that current regulatory requirements will not change  currently unforeseen environmental incidents will not occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations will not be discovered 

table of contents other factors affecting our business and financial results oil and gas prices fluctuate widely  and lower prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas 
these prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our credit facility is subject to periodic redeterminations based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce 
among the factors that can cause fluctuations are the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price and availability of alternative fuels  weather conditions  the level of consumer demand  the price of foreign imports  world wide economic conditions  political conditions in oil and gas producing regions  and domestic and foreign governmental regulations 
our use of oil and gas price hedging contracts involves credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our net income 
we use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines  their use also may limit future revenues from price increases 
hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations 
our future success depends on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
as is generally the case  our producing properties in the gulf of mexico and the onshore gulf coast often have high initial production rates  followed by steep declines 
to maintain production levels  we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those depleted by production 
without successful exploration or acquisition activities  our reserves  production and revenues will decline rapidly 
we may be unable to find and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost 
in addition  substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves 
if lower oil and gas prices or operating difficulties result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected or limit our ability to borrow under our credit arrangements  we may be unable to expend the capital necessary to locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves 
actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves and future cash flows from those reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
estimating accumulations of oil and gas is complex 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysic  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the proved reserve information set forth in this report is based on estimates we prepared 
estimates prepared by others might differ materially from our estimates 

table of contents actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves  future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development and prevailing oil and gas prices 
our reserves also may be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs in effect at december actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs we used 
if oil and gas prices decrease  we may be required to take writedowns 
we may be required to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties when oil and gas prices decrease or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves  increases in our estimates of operating or development costs or deterioration in our exploration results 
we capitalize the costs to acquire  find and develop our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting method 
the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  using period end oil and gas prices and a discount factor  plus the lower of cost or fair market value for unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
we review the carrying value of our properties quarterly  based on prices in effect including the effect of our hedge positions as of the end of each quarter or as of the time of reporting our results 
the carrying value of oil and gas properties is computed on a country by country basis 
therefore  while our properties in one country may be subject to a writedown  our properties in other countries could be unaffected 
once recorded  a writedown of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices increase 
we may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors  including recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs  and potential environmental and other liabilities 
the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain 
in connection with these assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices 
our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
inspections may not always be performed on every platform or well  and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems 
we often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an as is basis 
we may not achieve the production growth we anticipated from our properties in the uinta basin 
in august  we acquired inland for approximately million in cash 
inland s primary asset is the  acre monument butte field located in the uinta basin of northeast utah 
waterflooding  a secondary recovery operation that involves the injection of large volumes of water into the oil producing reservoir  is necessary to recover the oil reserves in the field 
we must negotiate with third parties to obtain additional sources of water 
the crude oil produced in the uinta basin is known as black wax and has a higher paraffin content than crude oil found in most other major north american basins 
currently  area refineries have limited capacity to refine this type of crude oil 
our ability to significantly 
table of contents increase production from the field may be limited by the unavailability of sufficient water supplies or refining capacity or both 
in addition  the performance of waterflood operations is often difficult to predict 
competitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations 
competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and proved undeveloped acreage 
major and independent oil and gas companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties  as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop their properties 
many of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours  which may adversely affect our ability to compete with these companies 
drilling is a high risk activity 
our future success will depend on the success of our drilling programs 
in addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below  these activities involve the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and producing wells 
furthermore  our drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
the oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses  insurance may not protect us against all these risks 
these risks include fires  explosions  blow outs  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas  formation water or drilling fluids  natural disasters  pipe or cement failures  casing collapses  embedded oilfield drilling and service tools  abnormally pressured formations  and environmental hazards such as oil spills  natural gas leaks  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these events occur  we could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  severe damage or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  investigatory and clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  suspension of our operations  and repairs to resume operations 

table of contents if we experience any of these problems  our ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected 
offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment  such as capsizing  collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions 
these conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
as a result  we could incur substantial liabilities or reductions in revenue that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for our exploration and development programs and acquisitions  or result in the loss of properties 
we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these potential risks and losses 
we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  it could adversely affect us 
exploration in deepwater involves greater operating and financial risks than exploration at shallower depths 
these risks could result in substantial losses 
deepwater drilling and operations require the application of recently developed technologies and involve a higher risk of mechanical failure 
we will likely experience significantly higher drilling costs in connection with the deepwater wells that we drill 
in addition  much of the deepwater play lacks the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters 
as a result  development of a deepwater discovery may be a lengthy process and require substantial capital investment  resulting in significant financial and operating risks 
in addition  as we carry out our deepwater program  we may not serve as the operator of significant projects in which we invest 
as a result  we may have limited ability to exercise influence over operations related to these projects or their associated costs 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these deepwater projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities in the deepwater of the gulf of mexico 
the success and timing of drilling and exploitation activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control  including the timing and amount of capital expenditures  the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs  drilling equipment  support vessels  production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel  the operator s expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants in drilling wells  and selection of technology 
we have risks associated with our foreign operations 
we currently have international activities and we continue to evaluate and pursue new opportunities for international expansion in select areas 
ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the united states is subject to the various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of expropriation  nationalization  war or insurrection  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities and quasi governmental agencies  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  labor problems  and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations 

table of contents our international operations also may be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment 
in addition  if a dispute arises with respect to our foreign operations  we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states 
other independent oil and gas companies limited access to capital may change our exploration and development plans 
many independent oil and gas companies have limited access to the capital necessary to finance their activities 
as a result  some of the other working interest owners of our wells may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due 
these problems could cause us to change  suspend or terminate our drilling and development plans with respect to the affected project 
forward looking information this report contains information that is forward looking or relates to anticipated future events or results such as planned capital expenditures  the availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures  estimates of proved reserves and the estimated present value of such reserves  wells planned to be drilled in the future  product targets  anticipated production rates  our financing plans and our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in this information are reasonable  this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties 
actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors  including drilling results  oil and gas prices  well and waterflood performance  severe weather conditions such as hurricanes  the prices of goods and services  the availability of drilling rigs and other support services  the availability of capital resources  and the other factors affecting our business described above under the captions regulation and other factors affecting our business and financial results

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
oil and gas prices we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next months as part of our risk management program 
in the case of acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
we use hedging to reduce price volatility  help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and returns on some of our acquisitions and drilling programs 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions 
while hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
for a further discussion of our hedging activities  see the information under the caption oil and gas hedging in item of this report 
interest rates at december   our long term debt was comprised of fixed variable rate debt rate debt in millions bank revolving credit facility senior notes due senior notes due senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due the interest rate at december  for our libor based loans under our credit facility was 
as of december   million principal amount of our senior notes due and million principal amount of our senior notes due were subject to interest rate swaps 
these swaps provide for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments  and are designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our outstanding senior notes 
we considered our interest rate exposure at year end to be minimal because about of our long term debt obligations  after taking into account our interest rate swap agreements  were at fixed rates 
the impact on annual cash flow of a change in the floating rate applicable to our variable rate debt would be million 
foreign currency exchange rates our operations in the uk and malaysia use the british pound and the malaysian ringgit  respectively  as their functional currency 
the functional currency for all other foreign operations is the us dollar 
to the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective country s functional currency  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
we consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements  based on net cash flows  to be immaterial 
we did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at december
