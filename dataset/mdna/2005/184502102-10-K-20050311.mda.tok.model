item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition executive summary our financial results for were led by our outdoor advertising business 
we saw strong local and national advertising demand for our domestic bulletin inventory across substantially all markets 
our international street furniture and transit businesses performed well as signs of an economic recovery materialized in some of our markets  such as the united kingdom  italy  belgium and australia 
our television business had a strong year as well  benefiting from advertising dollars generated by the olympics and local and national elections 
our radio business reported increases in revenue of for as compared to  with local advertising being stronger than national advertising 
about of our business is derived from national advertisers  many of which remained cautious with their radio advertising spending throughout the year 
during the fourth quarter  we instituted an initiative to improve the value of radio for listeners and advertisers 
the initiative included a reduction in commercial minutes by an average of across our stations and transitioned to selling more second advertisements instead of the traditional second advertisements 
we also expanded our commitment to the spanish language format 
we rolled out various spanish language programming on nine stations in and expect to roll out more stations over the next months 
internet initiatives and digital broadcasting are other areas of focus for our radio operations 
during  we committed to digital broadcasts of our radio signals and we expect to roll this out across our top markets over the next three years 
finally  it was a difficult year for our live entertainment business  as we saw a significant amount of concert cancellations and pressure from artist guarantees 
we believe some of these cancellations were a result of the culmination of consumer discontent with escalating ticket prices 
this  coupled with the increased costs associated with artist guarantees  compressed the overall profit margin of this segment 
format of presentation management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
our discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis 
our reportable operating segments are radio broadcasting  which includes our national syndication business  outdoor advertising and live entertainment 
included in the other segment are television broadcasting  sports representation and our media representation business  katz media 
we manage our operating segments primarily on their operating income  which is the focus of our discussion of the results of operations of our operating segments 
corporate expenses  interest expense  gain loss on sale of marketable securities  equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates  other income expense net  and income tax benefit expense are managed on a total company basis and are  therefore  included only in our discussion of consolidated results 
radio broadcasting our local radio markets are run predominantly by local management teams who control the formats selected for their programming 
the formats are designed to reach audiences with targeted demographic characteristics that appeal to our advertisers 
our advertising rates are principally based on how many people in a targeted audience are listening to our stations  as measured by an independent ratings service 
the size of the market influences rates as well  with larger markets typically receiving higher rates than smaller markets 
also  our advertising rates are influenced by the time of day the advertisement airs  with morning and evening drive time hours typically the highest 
we sell a certain number of radio advertising spots per hour to our advertisers 
radio advertising contracts are typically less than one year 
beginning december  in an effort to improve the listening experience for our audience and enhance the value of radio advertising  we began a new initiative called less is more 
research showed that our listeners and advertisers were concerned about the amount of non entertainment content on the radio 
so  the less is more initiative lowers the amount of commercial minutes played per hour by approximately across our stations 
less is more also limits the length of commercials in a spot break to approximately minutes or less as well as reducing the amount of promotional interruption on all of our radio stations 
the strategy is being implemented at the market level  based on the competition within each market  the format of the station and the time of day 

table of contents a key component of less is more is encouraging advertisers to invest in shorter advertisements rather than the traditional second spot 
based on our research  we believe that the effectiveness of a commercial is not related to its length 
because effectiveness is not tied to the length of the advertisement  on a cost per thousand listeners reached basis  we can provide our advertisers a more efficient investment with our new shorter commercials than with the traditional second commercials 
management monitors macro level indicators to assess our radio operations performance 
due to the geographic diversity and autonomy of our markets  we have a multitude of market specific advertising rates and audience demographics 
therefore  our discussion of the results of operations of our radio broadcasting segment focuses on the macro level indicators that management monitors to assess our radio segment s financial condition and results of operations 
management looks at our radio operations overall revenues as one of its main performance metrics 
management also looks at local advertising  which is sold predominately in a station s local market  and national advertising  which is sold across multiple markets 
local advertising is sold by our local radio stations sales staffs while national advertising is sold  for the most part  through our national representation firm 
local and national advertising revenues are tracked separately  because these revenue streams have different sales forces  respond differently to changes in the economic environment  and because local advertising is the primary driver of our radio revenues 
management also looks at radio revenue by market size  as defined by arbitron 
typically  larger markets can reach bigger audiences with wider demographics than smaller markets 
over half of our radio revenue and divisional operating expenses comes from our largest markets 
additionally  management reviews our share of listeners in target demographics listening to the radio in an average quarter hour 
this metric gauges how well our formats are attracting and keeping listeners 
a significant portion of our radio segment s expenses vary in connection with changes in revenue 
these variable expenses primarily relate to costs in our sales department  such as salaries  commissions and bad debt 
our programming and general and administrative departments incur most of our fixed costs  such as talent costs  rights fees  utilities and office salaries 
lastly  our highly discretionary costs are in our marketing and promotions department  which we primarily incur to maintain and or increase our audience and market share 
outdoor advertising our outdoor advertising revenues are generated from selling advertisements on our display faces  which include bulletins  posters and transit displays  as well as street furniture panels 
our advertising rates are based on a particular display s impressions in relation to the demographics of a particular market and its location within a market 
our outdoor advertising contracts are typically based on the number of months or weeks the advertisement is displayed 
to monitor the health of our outdoor business  management reviews average rates  average occupancy and inventory levels of each of our display faces by market 
in addition  because a significant portion of our outdoor advertising is conducted in foreign markets  principally europe  management looks at the operating results from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis 
a constant dollar basis allows for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements 
our outdoor advertising revenue and divisional operating expenses increased during as compared to by approximately million and million  respectively  as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our significant outdoor expenses include production expenses  revenue sharing or minimum guarantees on our transit and street furniture contracts and site lease expenses  primarily for land under our advertising displays 
our site lease terms vary from monthly to yearly  can be for terms of years or longer and typically provide for renewal options 
our street furniture contracts are usually won in a competitive bid and generally have terms of between and years 

table of contents live entertainment we derive live entertainment revenues primarily from promoting or producing music and theatrical events 
revenues from these events are mainly from ticket sales  rental income  corporate sponsorships  concessions and merchandise 
we typically receive either all the ticket sales or just a fixed fee for each event we host 
we also generally receive fees representing a percentage of total concession sales from vendors and total merchandise sales from the performer or tour producer 
we generally receive higher music profits when an event is at a venue we own rather than a venue we rent 
the higher music profits are due to our ability to share in a percentage of the revenues received from concession and merchandise sales as well as the opportunity to sell sponsorships for venue naming rights and signage 
to judge the health of our live entertainment business  management monitors the number of shows  average paid attendance  talent cost as a percent of revenue  sponsorship dollars and ticket revenues 
in addition  because a significant portion of our live entertainment business is conducted in foreign markets  management looks at the operating results from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis 
a constant dollar basis allows for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements 
our live entertainment revenue and divisional operating expenses increased during as compared to by approximately million and million  respectively  as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary expense driver for live entertainment is talent cost 
talent cost is the amount we pay a musical artist or theatrical production to perform at an event 
this is a negotiated amount primarily driven by what the artist or production requires to cover their direct costs and the value of their time 
these fees are typically agreed to at a set minimum amount with the potential for additional profit sharing if the event exceeds set revenue targets

based on our current ratings level of bbb baa  our fees on borrowings are a basis point spread to libor and are basis points on the total billion facility 
in the event our ratings improve  the fee on borrowings and facility fee decline gradually to basis points and basis points  respectively  at ratings of a a or better 
in the event that our ratings decline  the fee on borrowings and facility fee increase gradually to 
table of contents basis points and basis points  respectively  at ratings of bb ba or lower 
we believe there are no other agreements that contain provisions that trigger an event of default upon a change in long term debt ratings that would have a material impact to our financial statements 
additionally  the amfm long term bonds  which are all senior notes due  contain certain restrictive covenants that limit the ability of amfm operating inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of clear channel  to incur additional indebtedness  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  pay dividends  consolidate  or affect certain asset sales

as of february   million shares had been repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of billion  including commission and fees  under all three share repurchase programs 
commitments  contingencies and future obligations commitments and contingencies there are various lawsuits and claims pending against us 
we believe that any ultimate liability resulting from those actions or claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
although we have recorded accruals based on our current assumptions of the future liability for these lawsuits  it is possible that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
see also item legal proceedings and note h commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidate financial statements in item included elsewhere in this report 
certain agreements relating to acquisitions provide for purchase price adjustments and other future contingent payments based on the financial performance of the acquired companies generally over a one to five year period 
we will continue to accrue additional amounts related to such contingent payments if and when it is determinable that the applicable financial performance targets will be met 
the aggregate of these contingent payments  if performance targets are met  would not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations 
future obligations in addition to our scheduled maturities on our debt  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space  certain broadcast facilities  equipment and the majority of the land occupied by our outdoor advertising structures under long term operating leases 
some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index  as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance 
we have minimum franchise payments associated with non cancelable contracts that enable us to display advertising on such media as buses  taxis  trains  bus shelters and terminals 
the majority of these contracts contain rent provisions that are calculated as the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenue or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment 
also  we have non cancelable contracts in our entertainment operations related to minimum performance payments with artists as well as various other contracts in our radio broadcasting operations related to program rights and music license fees 
in the normal course of business  our broadcasting operations have minimum future payments associated with employee and talent contracts 
these contracts typically contain cancellation provisions that allow us to cancel the contract with good cause 

table of contents the scheduled maturities of our credit facility  other long term debt outstanding  future minimum rental commitments under non cancelable lease agreements  minimum payments under other non cancelable contracts  payments under employment talent contracts  and capital expenditure commitments as of december  are as follows in millions payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year to years to years years long term debt credit facility other long term debt non cancelable operating leases non cancelable contracts employment talent contracts capital expenditures total market risk interest rate risk at december   approximately of our long term debt  including fixed rate debt on which we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a two percentage point change in the year s average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have changed by million and that our net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management may take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this interest rate analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
at december   we had entered into interest rate swap agreements with a billion aggregate notional amount that effectively float interest at rates based upon libor 
these agreements expire from february to march the fair value of these agreements at december  was an asset of million 
equity price risk the carrying value of our available for sale and trading equity securities is affected by changes in their quoted market prices 
it is estimated that a change in the market prices of these securities would change their carrying value at december  by million and would change accumulated comprehensive income loss and net income by million and million  respectively 
at december   we also held million of investments that do not have a quoted market price  but are subject to fluctuations in their value 
we maintain derivative instruments on certain of our available for sale and trading equity securities to limit our exposure to and benefit from price fluctuations on those securities 
foreign currency we have operations in countries throughout the world 
foreign operations are measured in their local currencies except in hyper inflationary countries in which we operate 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure of international currency fluctuations  we maintain a natural hedge through borrowings in currencies other than the us dollar 
in addition  we have a us dollar euro cross currency swap which is also designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign denominated assets 
these hedge positions are reviewed monthly 
our foreign operations reported a net income of million 
table of contents for the year ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to foreign currencies would change net income for the year ended december  by million 
our earnings are also affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of our investments in various countries  all of which are accounted for under the equity method 
it is estimated that the result of a fluctuation in the value of the dollar relative to these foreign currencies at december  would change our equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates by million and would change our net income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
this analysis does not consider the implications that such fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the us or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities 
recent accounting pronouncements the sec staff made staff announcement no 
d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill d  at the september meeting of the emerging issues task force eitf 
d states that the residual method should no longer be used to value intangible assets other than goodwill 
rather  a direct method should be used to determine the fair value of all intangible assets required to be recognized under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
registrants who have applied the residual method to the valuation of intangible assets for purposes of impairment testing under statement of financial accounting standards no  goodwill and other intangible assets  shall perform an impairment test using a direct value method on all intangible assets that were previously valued using the residual method by no later than the beginning of their first fiscal year beginning after december  we adopted d for our fiscal year ended december  as a result of adoption  we recorded a non cash charge of billion  net of deferred taxes of billion  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the fourth quarter of in december the financial accounting standards board  fasb issued fasb statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
statement 
statement eliminates the apb exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date of issuance 
the provisions of statement should be applied prospectively 
we expect to adopt statement for our fiscal year beginning january  and we do not believe that adoption will materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fsp  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp allows an enterprise additional time beyond the financial reporting period in which the act was enacted to evaluate the effects of the act on its plans for repatriation of unremitted earnings for purposes of applying fasb statement  accounting for income taxes 
fsp clarifies that an enterprise is required to apply the provisions of statement in the period  or periods  it decides on its plan s for reinvestment or repatriation of its unremitted foreign earnings 
fsp requires disclosure if an enterprise is unable to reasonably estimate  at the time of issuance of its financial statements  the related range of income tax effects for the potential range of foreign earnings that it may repatriate and requires an enterprise to recognize income tax expense benefit if an enterprise decides to repatriate a portion of unremitted earnings under the repatriation provision while it is continuing to evaluate the effects of the repatriation provision for the remaining portion of the unremitted foreign earnings 
fsp is effective upon issuance 
we currently have the ability and intent to reinvest any undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
any impact from this legislation has not been reflected in the amounts shown since we are reinvested for the foreseeable future 

table of contents in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r is effective for financial statements for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  early adoption is permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r in the third quarter of as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we are unable to quantify the impact of adoption of statement r at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow 
this requirement will increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such difference could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note a  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this annual report on form k 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our independent auditor and the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates  the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit  adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the agings and changes in current economic conditions 
if our agings were to improve or deteriorate resulting in a change in our allowance  it is estimated that our bad debt expense would have changed by million and our net income would have changed by million 

table of contents long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that depreciable and amortizable long lived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair market value 
we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these assets  including future expected cash flows and discount rates  as well as future salvage values 
our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
using the impairment review described  we found no impairment charge required for the year ended december  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations 
we review goodwill for potential impairment annually using the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
the fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit 
to the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value  an impairment charge may be required to be recorded 
the income approach we use for valuing goodwill involves estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets  discounted to their present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
terminal values were also estimated and discounted to their present value 
in accordance with statement  we performed our annual impairment tests as of october   and on goodwill 
no impairment charges resulted from these tests 
we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under statement to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase  respectively indefinite lived assets indefinite lived assets such as fcc licenses are reviewed annually for possible impairment using the direct method 
under the direct method  it is assumed that rather than acquiring a radio station as a going concern business  the buyer hypothetically obtains a fcc license and builds a new station or operation with similar attributes from scratch 
thus  the buyer incurs start up costs during the build up phase which are normally associated with going concern value 
initial capital costs are deducted from the discounted cash flow model which results in value that is directly attributable to the fcc license 
the purchase price is then allocated between tangible and identified intangible assets including the fcc license  and any residual is allocated to goodwill 
our key assumptions using the direct method are market revenue growth rates  market share  profit margin  duration and profile of the build up period  estimated start up capital costs and losses incurred during the build up period  the risk adjusted discount rate and terminal values 
this data is populated using industry normalized information representing an average station within a market 
the sec staff issued staff announcement no 
d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill  at the september meeting of the emerging issues task force 
d states that the residual method should no longer be used to value intangible assets other than goodwill 
prior to adoption of d  the company recorded its acquisition of radio and television stations and outdoor permits at fair value using an industry accepted income approach and consequently applied the same approach for purposes of impairment testing 
our adoption of the direct method resulted in an aggregate fair value of our radio and television fcc licenses and outdoor permits that was less than the carrying value determined under our prior method 
as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of billion  net of deferred taxes of billion as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future 
if our assumption on market revenue growth rate decreased  our non cash charge  net of tax  would increase million 
similarly  if our assumption on market revenue growth rate increased  our non cash charge  net of tax  would decrease million 
accounting for investments at december   we had million recorded as other investments 
other investments are composed primarily of equity securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale or trading and are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices 
securities are carried at historical value when quoted market prices are unavailable 
the net unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  net of tax  are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the net unrealized gains or losses on trading securities are reported in the statement of operations 
in addition  we hold investments that do not have quoted market prices 
we review the value of these investments and record an impairment charge in the statement of operations for any decline in value that is determined to be other than temporary 
we recorded no impairment charges during the year ended december  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the year ended december   related to other than temporary declines in value of various media companies 
in addition  at december   we had million recorded as investments accounted for under the equity method 
we review the value of these investments and record an impairment charge in the statement of operations for any decline in value that is determined to be other than temporary 
tax accruals the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities routinely examine our tax returns 
from time to time  the irs challenges certain of our tax positions 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs could require us to make additional tax payments 
we believe that we have adequately accrued for any foreseeable payments resulting from tax examinations and consequently do not anticipate any material impact upon their ultimate resolution 
the estimate of our tax accruals contains uncertainty because management uses judgment to estimate the exposure associated with our various filing positions 
although management believes that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
to the extent there are changes in the expected outcome of tax examinations  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
litigation accruals we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
management s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
insurance accruals we are currently self insured beyond certain retention amounts for various insurance coverages  including general liability and property and casualty 
accruals are recorded based on estimates of actual claims filed  historical payouts  existing insurance coverage and projections of future development of costs related to existing claims 

table of contents our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of december  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at december   would have affected net earnings by approximately million for the year ended december  inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for wages  salaries and equipment 
although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable  we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our broadcasting stations and outdoor display faces 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows year ended december  for the year ended december   fixed charges exceeded earnings before income taxes and fixed charges by billion 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total enterprise basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges 
fixed charges represent interest  amortization of debt discount and expense  and the estimated interest portion of rental charges 
we had no preferred stock outstanding for any period presented
