item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction our primary business focus is on the development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of direct liquid fuel cell products for portable electronic devices  for the consumer personal and professional and military markets 
we are also working to develop and commercialize other technologies we own or own the rights to  including the cellscan 
we have recently curtailed or stopped the development program for some of our technologies  including our inherently conductive polymers and stirling cycle system  based upon our decision to devote more resources to developing our fuel cell technologies and commercializing fuel cell based products 
in recent years we have increased funding of our fuel cell related efforts  which increases we expect will continue until such time as we successfully commercialize our first fuel cell products  of which we can give no assurance  and perhaps thereafter 
this presentation includes the operations of our wholly owned subsidiaries  unless we tell you otherwise 
results of operations from our inception in april through december  we have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately  including approximately  from amortization expense 
we expect to incur additional operating losses during and possibly thereafter  principally as a result of our continuing anticipated research and development costs  increases in selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses related to the introduction of our products and the uncertainty of bringing our fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies to commercial success 
since our inception  we have relied principally on outside sources of funding to finance our operations  as our revenues have been minimal 
we expect this to continue until we are able to successfully commercialize our fuel cell or any of our other products or technologies  of which we can give no assurance 
our research and development costs  net have increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december   however  if we are unable to successfully commercially develop our fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies  we will be forced to curtail our spending levels until such time  if ever  as we generate revenues or otherwise receive funds from third party sources 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we sustained a net loss of  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in the net loss can primarily be attributed to an increase in research and development costs as we increase funding of our fuel cell related efforts  and an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses including non cash charges related to stock options and warrants  somewhat offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets during the year ended december   as certain intangible assets have become fully amortized 
we did not recognize any revenues during the year ended december   compared to revenues of approximately  and gross profit of approximately  during the year ended december  the revenues recognized during the year ended december  were attributable to a january agreement to develop for a third party an application for the use of our inherently conductive polymers in its fuel cell products 
research and development costs amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increases in research and development costs incurred during compared to  can be primarily attributed to an increase of approximately  in costs related to our fuel cell technologies and an increase of approximately  in costs related to our cellscan  somewhat offset by a net decrease of approximately  in costs related to our toroidal technologies  stirling cycle system  linear compressor and other research and development costs 
the research and development activities for the periods presented include fuel cell technologies 
we incurred costs relating to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  during the year ended december  compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the increase in our research and development expenses related to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  reflect our decision to continue to devote substantial and increasing amounts of resources to the further development of our fuel cell technologies and products 
cellscan 
we incurred costs relating to the refinement and assembly of the desktop cellscan system and on various cellscan research activities of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   in order to move towards commercialization of the cellscan  we devoted a greater proportion of our cellscan resources to the assembly of additional desktop cellscan systems  as compared to the same periods in when we devoted a greater proportion to the establishment of cellscan research programs at third party medical institutions 
toroidal technologies  stirling cycle system  linear compressor and other costs 
we incurred costs relating to our toroidal engine and compressor  stirling cycle system  linear compressor and other research and development costs aggregating approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the decrease reflects management s decision to allocate less of our resources to the development of these technologies and more of our resources to the development of our fuel cell technologies and products 
selling  marketing  general and administrative sg a expenses during the year ended december  amounted to approximately  compared to approximately  during the year ended december  the increase of  for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase in non cash charges relating to stock options and warrants of approximately  comprised of approximately  related to the extension of the expiration date of certain stock options and warrants  partially offset by a net decrease of approximately  in other costs related to stock options and warrants  an increase in selling and marketing expenses of approximately  an increase in professional fees of approximately  an increase in labor and executive consulting costs of approximately  an increase in insurance costs of approximately  and a net increase in various other sg a cost categories of approximately  amortization of intangible assets amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the decrease for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to intangible assets acquired in our september exchange offer for shares of medis el that we did not already own becoming fully amortized during the year ended december   partially offset by amortization of intangible assets acquired in our march acquisition of the remaining of more energy that we did not already own 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we sustained net losses of  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the decrease in the net losses can primarily be attributed to decreases in amortization of certain intangible assets as such intangible assets become fully amortized  somewhat offset by an increases in research and development costs as we increase funding of our fuel cell related efforts  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we recognized revenues of approximately  and gross profit of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to revenues of approximately  and gross profit of approximately  during the year ended december  the revenue in is attributable to a january agreement to develop for a third party an application for the use of our inherently conductive polymers in its fuel cell products 
in october  such agreement was terminated by the other party to the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date  for reasons unrelated to our technology or performance 
since the inception of such agreement in january  we received approximately  and expect to receive an additional amount of approximately  on billings for the period prior to the termination 
we do not expect to receive the  balance that would have been due under such agreement had it run through its entire term 
the revenues recognized in were attributed both to  under the january agreement and to  under a one time purchase order in which we designed a direct liquid fuel cell for use in a new energy pack for infantry soldiers 
all of such revenues are non recurring 
research and development costs amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increases in research and development costs incurred during compared to can be primarily attributed to an increase of approximately  related to our fuel cell technologies  somewhat offset by a decrease of approximately  in costs related to our cellscan and a net decrease of approximately  in costs related to our toroidal technologies  stirling cycle system  linear compressor and other costs 
the research and development activities for the periods presented include fuel cell technologies 
we incurred costs relating to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  during the year ended december  net of credits aggregating approximately  recognized pursuant to our contracts with general dynamics  compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the net increase in our research and development expenses relating to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  in compared to reflects our decision to continue to devote substantial and increasing amounts of resources to the further development of our fuel cell technologies and products 
cellscan 
we incurred costs relating to the refinement of the desktop cellscan system and on various cellscan research activities of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the decrease in compared to can be primarily attributed to decreases in costs incurred related to the retention of third party researchers in the development and testing of new cellscan applications  labor costs and material costs  partially offset by an increase in other costs 
toroidal technologies  stirling cycle system  linear compressor and other 
we incurred aggregate costs relating to our toroidal engine and compressor  stirling cycle system  linear compressor and other costs of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the decrease in compared to can be primarily attributed to decreases costs incurred from the use of consultants and subcontractors  labor costs  and other costs reflecting management s decision to allocate more of our research and development resources to fuel cell development 
selling  marketing  general and administrative sg a expenses during the year ended december  amounted to approximately  compared to approximately  during the year ended december  the increase of  during compared to is primarily attributable to an increase in non cash charges relating to stock options and warrants of approximately  an increase in insurance costs of approximately  and an increase in selling and marketing expenses of approximately  somewhat offset by a decrease in executive and other consulting expenses of approximately  and a net decrease in various other sg a cost categories aggregating to approximately  amortization of intangible assets amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to intangible assets acquired in our june exchange offer for shares of medis el that we did not already own becoming fully amortized during the year ended december   partially offset by amortization of intangible assets acquired in our march acquisition of the remaining of more energy that we did not already own 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations primarily through the proceeds of investor equity financing  which we will continue to depend on  at the earliest  until such time as we successfully commercialize our fuel cell products or products derived from any of our other technologies 
our working capital and capital requirements at any given time depend upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to the progress of research and development programs  the status of our technologies  and the level of resources that we devote to the development of our technologies  patents  marketing and sales capabilities 
another possible source of revenue or other means to effect our cash expenditures are collaborative arrangements with businesses and institutes for research and development and companies participating in the development of our technologies 
since january  we have realized revenues of  on costs of sales of  as well as credits against our research and development costs of approximately  with respect to collaborative arrangements with third parties relating to our fuel cell technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will realize additional revenue or credits to our research and development expense from such collaborative arrangements still in existence or that we will enter into additional collaborative arrangements in the future 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will raise additional funds through any financing approach implemented by us 
in january  we issued  shares of our common stock in a private placement to institutional investors 
we received gross proceeds of approximately  less related costs of approximately  in december  we issued  shares of our common stock in a private placement to an accredited investor  for proceeds of approximately during the year ended december   optionholders  including officers and a director  exercised outstanding options issued under our stock option plan to acquire  shares of our common stock  for aggregate proceeds of approximately  during the year ended december   warrant holders  including officers and directors  exercised outstanding warrants to acquire  shares of our common stock  at exercise prices ranging from to per share  for aggregate proceeds of approximately  in january  we issued  shares of our common stock in a private sale to an accredited investor  for proceeds of approximately  proceeds from all of the above financing and option and warrant exercises have been and will continue to be used for working capital  including for the continued development and production of our direct liquid fuel cell technologies and related products  as well as for selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was  as compared to  for year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to management s decision to continue to increase levels of spending on research and development related to our fuel cell technologies during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and increases in sg a expenditures  as described more fully above 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was  which represented the following i investments in short term deposits of  fully offset by maturities of  ii purchases of property and equipment of approximately  of which approximately  represents leasehold improvements and other property and equipment costs for our new facility in lod  israel including  of leasehold incentive obligation  and iii a loan of approximately  to gennadi finkelshtain  the general manager of more energy  under an existing three year promissory note dated april   as amended  made principally to enable him to pay the final installment of certain taxes arising in connection with our march purchase from him of the remaining of more energy we did not already own 
this is compared to net cash used in investing activities of  for the year ended december   which was comprised of capital expenditures aggregating approximately  and a loan of approximately  to mr 
finkelshtain pursuant to the promissory note described above 
for the year ended december   cash aggregating  was provided by financing activities  compared to  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   cash was provided by the financing activities described above 
the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  aggregating  was generated from i our march  rights offering from which we generated gross proceeds of approximately  less costs of such offering of approximately  ii proceeds of approximately  less related costs of approximately  pursuant to our offer to exchange and exercise which commenced september  and expired on november   iii warrant holders exercising warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  for proceeds of approximately  and iv holders of options issued under our stock option plan exercised options to acquire an aggregate of  shares or our common stock  for proceeds of approximately  as of december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents and an unused  revolving credit line which terminates in accordance with its terms on july  as of december   giving effect to the  we raised in our january private placement and to the approximately  we raised in through march  from the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants  we believe that our cash resources  including monies available to us from our unused credit facility  will be sufficient to support our projected expenditures for operating and developmental activities for our power pack products and purchases of capital equipment  for at least the next months 
however  our plans for volume manufacturing and marketing would require us very sharply to increase our spending levels prior to the end of such period  as our initial estimate is that preparing for volume production  including construction of a manufacturing line  will cost approximately million 
to accomplish those plans we will need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
we also may require such financing in order to be competitive  to establish a stronger financial position and to continue our operations 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to meet our financial obligations  if necessary  or that a third party will be willing to make such funds available 
our failure to raise additional funds could require us to delay or curtail the marketing and production programs relating to our planned roll out of the disposable power pack  and research and product development efforts or cause us to default under the repayment terms of our revolving credit facility  if we were to borrow funds under that facility and we are unable to repay such borrowings 
furthermore  our failure to successfully develop or market our fuel cell products or products derived from any of our other technologies may materially adversely affect our ability to raise additional funds 
in any event  it is not possible to make any reliable estimate of the funds required to complete the development of our fuel cell technologies or any of our other technologies or market and produce our fuel cell products 
commitments and contingencies the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at december  payment due by period contractual obligations total and thereafter operating lease obligation purchase obligations other long term liabilities note total note other long term liabilities represents our accrued severance pay as of december  since we do not expect a high level of employee turnover giving rise to the payment of significant amounts of severance obligations  we have included approximately of the total liability in each of the years through and the remainder in and thereafter 
tax matters as of december   for us federal income tax purposes  we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  for israeli income tax purposes  we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  since our inception  we have not had any taxable income 
also  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries have ever been audited by the united states or israeli tax authorities since incorporation 
the availability of our us net operating loss carry forwards may be reduced to the extent one or more direct or indirect holders of or greater amount of our common stock increases their equity interest in us by more than in the aggregate 
grants obtained from the state of israel medis el  our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  received approximately  in research and development grants from the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of commerce and industry of the state of israel from its inception to this is based upon a policy of the government of israel to provide grants of between and of qualifying approved research and development expenditures to promote research and development by israeli companies 
medis el received of qualifying approved research and development expenditures  with  of such funds being allotted for the cellscan and  allotted for the neuritor 
pursuant to the grant arrangement  medis el is required to pay of its sales of cellscan and neuritor products developed with the grant funds until the grant amounts are paid in full 
there is no requirement to repay the grants if the products developed with the grant funds are not sold 
if medis el sells the underlying technology prior to repaying the grant funds  it must first seek permission from the israeli government for such sale 
prior to medis el receiving grant funds in  medis el assumed from israel aircraft industries inc  our largest stockholder  its obligation relating to the repayment of grants out of future royalties  if any  of approximately  as of december   medis el s total contingent obligation for the repayment of grants  which includes the  is  neither we nor medis el presently receive any grants from the state of israel 
approved enterprise under the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments   medis el was issued a certificate of approval as an approved enterprise 
under the law  medis el elected the combined path  pursuant to which medis el had the right to receive a government guaranteed bank loan of of the amount of the approved investment 
in addition  medis el had the right to receive a grant of of the approved investment  in which case the loan would be reduced by the amount of the grant 
medis el received investment grants of approximately  and loans of approximately  the investment grants were used to invest in equipment  furniture and fixtures and commercial vehicles 
the loan proceeds were used for the above as well as to acquire know how  leasehold improvements  marketing and working capital 
the loans were paid off in full during the year ended december  additionally  the tax liability in respect of medis el s income deriving from its approved enterprise activities is calculated at a rate of of income for a ten year period  with tax on dividends distributed of  instead of 
these tax benefits expire in in september  more energy  our fuel cell subsidiary  was granted approved enterprise status 
the plan provides a two year tax exemption  as well as reduced tax for a period of years 
the benefits from the approved enterprise programs depend upon more energy fulfilling the conditions under the grant and the laws governing the grant 
the commencement of the benefits period is determined beginning with the year in which taxable income is initially generated by the approved enterprise  provided that the earlier of years have not elapsed from the year in which the approval was granted  or years from the year in which the enterprise was initially operated 
more energy s initial approved enterprise plan was completed during and it is in the process of submitting a new plan 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate past judgments and our estimates  including those related to goodwill and intangible assets  stock options and warrants and deferred income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets we consider accounting policies related to our goodwill and other intangible assets to be critical due to the estimation processes involved and their materiality to our financial statements 
as of december   the net book values of our goodwill and intangible assets were  and  respectively 
our goodwill and other intangible assets arose primarily as a result of three purchase accounting transactions our acquisition of the minority interest in medis inc in  our exchange of our shares for the minority interest in medis el in and our acquisition of the remaining of more energy that we did not already own in in amortizing our goodwill through december  and our intangible assets through december   we made estimates and assumptions regarding the useful lives of such assets 
if our estimates and assumptions change  the useful lives and resulting charges to operations for amortization of such assets would also change 
additionally  with respect to our goodwill and intangible assets  as of january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june sfas no 
requires enterprises  effective january   to discontinue amortizing goodwill  and instead requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment 
as part of our initial evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets for any possible impairment  as of january   we were required to use estimates and assumptions with respect to markets for our products  future cash flows  discount rates and timing of commercialization of our technologies in determining the fair value of our reporting units 
we have also performed annual tests for impairment of our goodwill in  and the estimates we used assume that our products will be accepted and that we will gain market share in the future and will experience growth in such market share 
if we fail to deliver products or to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or assumed gross margins  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if our estimates and or other assumptions change or other circumstances change with respect to future cash flows  discount rates and timing of commercialization of our technologies  we may  in the future  be required to record charges to operations for impairment of our goodwill and or our intangible assets 
stock options and warrants we also consider accounting policies related to stock options and warrants to be critical due to the estimation process involved 
we utilize stock options and warrants as an important means of compensation for employees  directors and consultants and also warrants as an instrument in our fundraising process 
accounting for such options and warrants  in some circumstances  results in significant non cash charges to our operations or accumulated loss 
there are assumptions and estimates involved in determining the value of such stock options and warrants and the timing of related charges to our operations or accumulated loss 
these estimates and assumptions include the expected term of the option  volatility of our stock price and interest rates 
the market price of our stock also has a significant impact on charges we incur related to stock options and warrants 
if these estimates and assumptions change or if our stock price changes  the charges to operations and or accumulated loss could also change significantly 
as provided for in sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation in accounting for its employee stock options  under which compensation expense  if any  is generally based on the difference between the exercise price of an option or the amount paid for the award and the market price or fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of the grant 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which we obtain employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the our equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this statement eliminates the ability to account for employee share based payment transactions using apb no 
and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using the grant date fair value based method 
this statement will be effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  for our quarterly period beginning july  
we expect to incur significant non cash charges to operations on any grants of stock options to employees and directors subsequent to our adoption of sfasr as well as on unvested grants at the date of our adoption of sfas r 
deferred income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to zero 
in the event that we were to determine that we are likely to be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be credited to operations in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r on july  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt statement r using the modified prospective method and expects that the adoption will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions apb  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measure based on fair value of the assets exchanged 
apb included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary assets exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements 
fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp  provides guidance under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act was enacted on october  fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fasb statement no 
we expect that the adoption of fsp will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors we have had limited revenues since inception and none in   and  and we cannot predict when we will achieve profitability 
we have not been profitable and cannot predict when we will achieve profitability 
we have experienced net losses since our inception in april we  on a consolidated basis with our subsidiaries  have had limited revenues since inception and none in   and we do not anticipate generating significant revenues until we successfully develop  commercialize and sell products derived from our fuel cell technologies or any of our other technologies  of which we can give no assurance 
we are unable to determine when we will generate significant revenues from the sale of any of such products 
we cannot predict when we will achieve profitability  if ever 
our inability to become profitable may force us to curtail or temporarily discontinue our research and development programs and our day to day operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that profitability  if achieved  can be sustained on an ongoing basis 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we may never complete the development of commercially acceptable fuel cell products or develop any of our other technologies into commercially acceptable products 
we do not know when or whether we will successfully complete the development of commercially acceptable fuel cell products for our target markets  or develop any of our other technologies into commercially acceptable products 
we continue to seek to improve our fuel cell technologies  particularly in the areas of energy capacity  power density  stability of power output  operating time  reduction of size and weight as well as the temperature conditions under which the fuel cells can operate 
we also seek to improve the engineering design of our fuel cells and refill cartridges before we are able to produce a commercially acceptable product 
additionally  we must complete the production model of the converter used in our power pack to step up voltage together with the power management system that allows the fuel cell power pack to respond to differing voltage requirements of different devices 
failure of any of the above could delay or prevent the successful development of commercially acceptable fuel cell products for any of our target markets 
developing any technology into a marketable product that the consumer will desire to purchase is a risky  time consuming and expensive process 
you should anticipate that we will encounter setbacks  discrepancies requiring time consuming and costly redesigns and changes and that there is the possibility of outright failure 
we may not meet our product development and commercialization milestones and time tables 
we establish milestones and time tables  based upon our expectations regarding our technologies  plans and programs at that time  which we use to assess our progress toward developing and delivering into the market place commercially acceptable fuel cell product 
these milestones relate to technology and design improvements as well as to dates for achieving large scale production and marketing goals 
if our products exhibit technical defects or are unable to meet cost or performance goals  including levels and stability of power output  useful life and reliability  or if our production cannot be achieved in time our commercialization schedule could be delayed and third parties who are collaborating with us to manufacture or market our fuel cell products may decline to continue that collaboration 
furthermore  potential purchasers of our initial commercial products may lose interest or may opt to purchase alternative technologies 
generally  we have made technological advances and established production and distribution relationships that met our time table and milestone schedules 
we can give no assurance that our commercialization schedule will continue to be met as we further develop our fuel cell products  or any of our other technologies or products 
customers will be unlikely to buy our fuel cell products unless we can demonstrate that they can be produced for sale to consumers at attractive prices 
to date  we have focused primarily on research and development of our fuel cell technologies and are only at the early stages of production engineering for large scale production of our fuel cell products 
consequently  we have no experience in the final stages of manufacturing our fuel cell products on a commercial basis 
we plan to manufacture our fuel cell products through third party contract manufacturers 
we can offer no assurance that either we  our contract manufacturers or any other party we partner with to volume produce our products will develop efficient  automated  low cost manufacturing capabilities and processes to meet the quality  price  engineering  design and production standards or production volumes required to successfully mass market our fuel cell products 
even if we or our contract manufacturers are successful in developing such manufacturing capability and processes  we do not know whether we or they will be timely in meeting our product commercialization schedule or the production and delivery requirements of potential customers 
a failure to develop such manufacturing processes and capabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
the price of our fuel cell products is dependent largely on material and other manufacturing costs 
we are unable to offer any assurance that either we or a contract manufacturer will be able to reduce costs to a level which will allow production of a competitive product that the consumer finds attractive or that any product produced using lower cost materials and manufacturing processes will not suffer from a reduction in performance  reliability and longevity 
furthermore  although we have estimated a pricing structure for our fuel cell products  we can give no assurance that these estimates will be correct in light of any manufacturing process we adopt or distribution channels we use 
furthermore  our contemplated program for the volume production of our fuel cell products would require us to manufacture the electrodes  catalysts and fuel internally and deliver same to our proposed contract manufacturer 
although we have established electrode production operations in our facility in israel  we have not ascertained whether we are capable of production of any of that or any other components at a large enough scale to adequately supply those components in sufficient volume  or if those components will meet or surpass the manufacturing standards necessary for a successful final product 
a commercially acceptable market for our fuel cell products may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate 
a commercially acceptable market may never develop for our fuel cell products or any of our other technologies  or may develop more slowly than we anticipate 
our fuel cell products represent a new market product  and we do not know with certainty to what extent  if any  end users will want to purchase and use them 
the development of a commercially acceptable market for our fuel cell products may be affected by many factors  some of which are out of our control  including the level to which the capabilities of our fuel cell product has advanced in performance  time of use  size  weight  cost and other factors that determine consumer acceptance  the emergence of newer  more competitive technologies and products  improvements to existing technologies  including existing rechargeable battery technology or the chips used in the electronic devices that allow the batteries to operate more efficiently  the future cost of sodium borohydrides  alkalines  glycerol  ethanol  or any other hydrogen based fuels  the catalysts used in our fuel cell products or other chemicals used for powering our fuel cell products  regulations that affect or limit the use of the components in our fuel cells or our fuel cells in general  including regulations determining the use of our fuel cell products in an airplane cabin or other consumer uses  consumer perceptions of the safety of our products  and consumer reluctance to try a new product 
if a mass market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate  we may be unable to recover the losses we will have incurred in the development of our products and may never achieve profitability 
we will be unable to market or sell our fuel cell products or products derived from any of our other technologies if we are unsuccessful in entering into arrangements  alliances  joint ventures or licensing agreements with third parties 
as we do not have nor do we intend to develop our own marketing or wide scale manufacturing infrastructure  our ability to market  manufacture and sell our fuel cell technologies or any of our other technologies is wholly dependent on our entry into manufacturing  sales or distributing arrangements  strategic alliances  joint ventures or licensing agreements with third parties possessing such capabilities 
we can offer no assurance that we will be successful in entering into such arrangements  alliances  joint ventures or agreements or that the terms of which will be entirely beneficial to us 
problems or delays in our collaboration efforts with third parties to develop or market our fuel cell products could hurt our reputation and the reputation of our products 
we have entered into agreements with third parties who have agreed to assist us in developing or marketing our fuel cell products or producing and supplying components of our fuel cell products 
we are in discussions with other third parties and may enter into similar agreements with such other parties or others in the future  of which we can give no assurances of success 
these collaboration agreements contemplate that these third parties will work with our scientists to test various aspects of  or assist in developing components of  our fuel cells 
such tests or development efforts may encounter problems and delays for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  the failure of our technology  the failure of the technology of others  the failure to combine these technologies properly and the failure to maintain and service any test prototypes properly 
many of these potential problems and delays are beyond our control 
in addition  collaborative efforts  by their nature  often create problems due to miscommunications and disparate expectations and priorities among the parties involved and may result in unexpected modifications and delays in developing or marketing our fuel cell technologies or impact the cost of making and delivering our fuel cell products 
any such problems or perceived problems with these collaborative efforts could hurt our reputation and the reputation of our products and technologies 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not offer sufficient protection  which could hinder our growth and success 
we regard our patents  trade secrets  copyrights and similar intellectual property rights as essential to our growth and success 
we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secret protection  confidentiality and non disclosure agreements and contractual provisions with employees and with third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we own  directly or indirectly through subsidiaries or companies in which we have an interest  patents for certain technologies and are currently applying for additional patents 
we can offer no assurance that we will succeed in receiving patent and other proprietary protection in all markets we enter  or  if successful  that such protection will be sufficient 
if we successfully develop and market any or all of our technologies  we expect to face efforts by larger companies and other organizations or authorities to undermine our patents by challenging or copying our intellectual property 
moreover  intellectual property rights are not protected in certain parts of the world 
we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property against any challenges that may arise 
however  any infringement action initiated by us may be very costly and require the diversion of substantial funds from our operations and may require management to expend efforts that might otherwise be devoted to our operations 
claims by third parties that our technology infringes upon their patents may  if successful  prevent us from further developing or selling our technologies 
although we do not believe our business activities infringe upon the rights of others  nor are we aware of any pending or contemplated actions to such effect  we can give no assurance that our business activities will not infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  or that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
if we do not obtain additional financing  we may be forced to curtail our planned manufacturing and marketing programs 
as well as research and development efforts 
our ability to carry out our plans for manufacturing and marketing our fuel cell products  as well as sustain our research and development program is dependent upon our ability to secure additional funding 
as of december   giving effect to the  we raised in our january private placement and to the approximately  we raised in through march  from the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants  we believe that our cash resources  including monies available to us from our unused credit facility  will be sufficient to support our projected expenditures for operating and developmental activities for our power pack products and purchases of capital equipment  for at least the next months 
however  our plans for volume manufacturing and marketing would require us very sharply to increase our spending levels  prior to the end of such period 
to accomplish those plans we will need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
we also may require such financing in order to be competitive  to establish a stronger financial position and to continue our operations 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to meet our financial obligations  if necessary  or that a third party will be willing to make such funds available 
our failure to raise additional funds could require us to delay or curtail our marketing and production programs and research and product development efforts or cause us to default under the repayment terms of our revolving credit facility  if we were to borrow funds under that facility and we are unable to repay such borrowings 
furthermore  our failure to successfully develop or market our fuel cell products or products derived from any of our other technologies may materially adversely affect our ability to raise additional funds 
in any event  it is not possible to make any reliable estimate of the funds required to complete the development of our fuel cell technologies or any of our other technologies or market and produce our fuel cell products 
if we were to lose our technical talent or members of senior management and could not find appropriate replacements in a timely manner  our business could be adversely affected 
our success depends to a significant extent upon zvi rehavi  executive vice president  gennadi finkelshtain general manager of more energy  and the other scientists  engineers and technicians that seek out  recognize and develop our technologies  as well as our highly skilled and experienced management  including robert k 
lifton  our chief executive officer  and howard weingrow  our president 
the loss of the services of messrs 
rehavi and finkelshtain  of any of our other technical talent or of messrs 
lifton and weingrow could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our fuel cell products into successful commercial products or any of our other technologies into commercial products 
we possess key person life insurance of  on mr 
rehavi and  on mr 
finkelshtain 
although to date we have been successful in recruiting and retaining executive  managerial and technical personnel  we can offer no assurance that we will continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel needed for our business 
the failure to attract or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
there may be adverse effects on our earnings and our stock price due to the large amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   our consolidated balance sheet showed approximately  of goodwill 
our goodwill balance of  is subject to a test for impairment at least annually  which could result in a charge to operations in the event impairment of the goodwill balance would be found 
we continue to amortize the remaining unamortized balance of our intangible assets of  with a remaining useful life of approximately months 
risks associated with conducting operations in israel could materially adversely affect our ability to complete the development of our fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies 
our research and development facilities  our pilot manufacturing facility for catalyst and electrodes  as well as some of our executive offices and back office functions  are located in the state of israel and our key personnel and their families reside in israel 
we are  therefore  directly affected by the political  economic and military conditions in israel 
any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and any other country  whether due to the israeli palestinian conflict or america s war against terrorism  among others  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete the development of any of our fuel cell products  our technologies or our ability to supply our technology to contract manufacturers  development partners  customers or vendors 
furthermore  any interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and any other country in which we have strategic relationships could similarly adversely affect such relationships 
in addition  all male adult permanent residents of israel under the age of  unless exempt  are obligated to perform up to days of military reserve duty annually and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
some of our employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty 
we are unable to assess what impact  if any  these factors may have upon our future operations 
in addition  historically  israel has suffered from high inflation and the devaluation of its currency  the new israeli shekel  or nis  compared to the us dollar 
future inflation or further devaluations of the nis may have a negative impact on our nis based obligations over time upon substantial price increases caused by inflation 
it may be difficult to serve process on or enforce a judgment against our israeli officers and directors  making it difficult to bring a successful lawsuit against us  or our officers and directors  individually or in the aggregate 
service of process upon our directors and officers  many of whom reside outside the united states  may be difficult to obtain within the united states 
furthermore  any judgment obtained in the united states against us may not be collectible within the united states to the extent our assets are located outside the united states 
this could limit the ability of our stockholders to sue us based upon an alleged breach of duty or other cause of action 
we have been informed by our israeli legal counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities under the securities act of and the securities exchange act of in original actions instituted in israel 
however  subject to limitation  israeli courts may enforce united states final executory judgments for liquidated amounts in civil matters  obtained after a trial before a court of competent jurisdiction  according to the rules of private international law currently prevailing in israel  which enforce similar israeli judgments  provided that due service of process has been effected and the defendant was given a reasonable opportunity to defend  the obligation imposed by the judgment is executionable according to the laws relating to the enforceability of judgments in israel  such judgment is not contrary to public policy  security or sovereignty of the state of israel and such judgment is executionable in the state in which it was given  such judgments were not obtained by fraud and do not conflict with any other valid judgments in the same manner between the same parties  and an action between the same parties in the same matter is not pending in any israeli court at the time the lawsuit is instituted in the foreign court 
foreign judgments enforced by israeli courts generally will be payable in israeli currency  which can then be converted into united states dollars and transferred out of israel 
the judgment debtor may also pay in dollars 
judgment creditors must bear the risk of unfavorable exchange rates 
we intend to retain all of our future earnings  if any  for use in our business operations and do not expect to pay dividends to our stockholders 
we have not paid any dividends on our common stock to date and do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future 
our board presently intends to retain all earnings  if any  for use in our business operations 
we currently face and will continue to face significant competition 
our fuel cell product face and will continue to face significant competition 
a large number of corporations  national laboratories and universities in the united states  canada  europe  japan and elsewhere are actively engaged in the development and manufacture of power sources  including batteries and fuel cells  both for portable electronic devices and other uses 
each of these competitors has the potential to capture market share in various markets  which would have a material adverse effect on our position in the industry and our financial results 
we expect competition to intensify greatly as the need for new energy alternatives becomes more apparent and continues to increase 
some of our competitors are well established and have substantially greater managerial  technical  financial  marketing and product development resources 
additionally  companies  government sponsored laboratories and universities  both large and small  are entering the markets in which we compete 
there can also be no assurance that current and future competitors will not be more successful in the markets in which we compete than we have been  or will be in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such a competitive environment 
we expect to be dependent on third party suppliers for the supply of key materials and components for our products 
if and when either we or our contract manufacturers or manufacturing  strategic alliance or joint venture partners commence production of our fuel cells or fuel cell products  of which there can be no assurance  we expect to rely upon third party suppliers to provide requisite materials and components 
a supplier s failure to supply materials or components in a timely manner  or to supply materials and components that meet our quality  quantity or cost requirements  or our inability to obtain substitute sources for these materials and components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us  could harm our ability to manufacture our fuel cell products or meet our cost target 
we or our contract manufacturers  manufacturing  strategic alliance or joint venture partners may be unable to obtain comparable materials or components from alternative suppliers  and that could adversely affect our ability to produce viable fuel cells or significantly raise the cost of producing fuel cells or fuel cell products 
in addition  platinum is presently a component of the anode electrode in our fuel cell products 
platinum is a scarce natural resource and we are dependent upon a sufficient supply of this commodity at a cost that allows us to meet our cost targets for our fuel cell products 
while we do not anticipate significant near or long term shortages in the supply of platinum  such shortages could adversely affect our ability to produce commercially acceptable fuel cell product or raise our cost of producing our fuel cell products beyond our targeted cost

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of inflation and devaluation on results of operations  liabilities and assets in connection with our currency use  we operate in a mixed environment 
payroll is paid in our local currency and the local currency of each of our subsidiaries  such as the new israeli shekel nis with respect to our israeli based operations  as are most of our other operating expenses 
consideration for virtually all sales is either in dollars or dollar linked currency 
as a result  not all monetary assets and all monetary liabilities are linked to the same base in the same amount at all points in time  which may cause currency fluctuation related losses 
in order to help minimize such losses  we currently invest our liquid funds in both dollar based and nis based assets 
for many years prior to  the israeli economy was characterized by high rates of inflation and devaluation of the israeli currency against the united states dollar and other currencies 
since the institution of the israeli economic program in  inflation  while continuing  has been significantly reduced and the rate of devaluation has been substantially diminished 
however  israel effected devaluations appreciations of the nis against the dollar as follows in and  the rate of inflation in israel exceeded the rate of devaluation of the nis against the dollar  but in  and the rate of devaluation of the nis against the dollar exceeded the rate of inflation in israel 
in  israel experienced both price deflation and an appreciation of the nis against the dollar 
in  the rate of inflation deflation in israel was and the rate of devaluation appreciation of the nis was  against the dollar 
additionally  in  through january  the rate of inflation deflation in israel was and the rate of devaluation of the nis was against the dollar 
impact of political and economic conditions the state of hostility which has existed in varying degrees in israel since  its unfavorable balance of payments and its history of inflation and currency devaluation  all represent uncertainties which may adversely affect our business
