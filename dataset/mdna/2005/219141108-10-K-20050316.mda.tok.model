income from operations for the year ended december  includes a charge of approximately million to provide an allowance for an unrecovered escrow deposit 
refer to item legal proceedings southern peaks regional treatment center 
we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
as required on january  prior to the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded an extraordinary charge of approximately million  net of income taxes of approximately million  in for the early retirement of debt 
as a result of the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
 we reclassified total costs of approximately million to loss on extinguishment of debt and the related income tax benefit of approximately million to provision for income taxes 
this reclassification is reflected in the amounts presented in this table 
for the year ended december   we recognized a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle charge of approximately million  net of income taxes of approximately million  related to the impairment of goodwill in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
in january for the year ended december   we recognized a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle benefit of approximately million  net of an income tax provision of approximately million  related to a change in our method of accounting for durable supplies 
residential service capacity is comprised of the number of beds currently available for service or available upon the completion of construction or renovation of residential facilities 
at certain residential facilities  the contracted capacity is lower than the facility s service capacity 
we could increase a facility s contracted capacity by obtaining additional contracts or by renegotiating existing contracts to increase the number of beds covered 
however  there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain contracts that provide occupancy levels at a facility s service capacity or that current contracted capacities can be maintained in future periods 
occupancy percentages reflect less than normalized occupancy during the start up phase of any applicable facility  resulting in a lower average contract occupancy in periods when we have substantial start up activities 
average contract occupancy percentages are calculated based on actual occupancy for the period as a percentage of the contracted capacity for residential facilities in operation 
these percentages do not reflect the operations of non residential community based programs 
at certain residential facilities  our contracted capacity is lower than the facility s service capacity 
additionally  certain facilities have and are currently operating above the contracted capacities 
as a result  average contract occupancy percentages can exceed if the average actual occupancy exceeded contracted capacity 
service capacity for non residential programs is based on either contractual terms or an estimate of the number of clients to be served 
we update these estimates at least annually based on the program s budget and other factors 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading provider of correctional  treatment and educational services outsourced by federal  state and local government agencies 
we provide a diversified portfolio of services for adults and juveniles through our three operating divisions adult secure institutional services  juvenile justice  educational and treatment services and adult community based corrections and treatment services 
at december   we operated facilities with a total service capacity of  and had facilities under development  construction or renovation with an aggregate service capacity of  upon completion 
our facilities are located in states and the district of columbia 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated total residential service capacity and contracted beds in operation at the end of the periods shown  average contract occupancy percentages and total non residential service capacity 
year ended december  residential service capacity contracted beds in operation end of period average contract occupancy based on contracted beds in operation average contract occupancy excluding start up operations non residential service capacity residential service capacity is comprised of the number of beds currently available for service or available upon the completion of construction or renovation of residential facilities 
at certain residential facilities  the contracted capacity is lower than the facility s service capacity 
we could increase a facility s contracted capacity by obtaining additional contracts or by renegotiating existing contracts to increase the number of beds covered 
however  there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain contracts that provide occupancy levels at a facility s service capacity or that current contracted capacities can be maintained in future periods

average contract occupancy percentages are calculated based on actual occupancy for the period as a percentage of the contracted capacity for residential facilities in operation 
these percentages do not reflect the operations of non residential community based programs 
at certain residential facilities  our contracted capacity is lower than the facility s service capacity 
additionally  certain facilities have and are currently operating above the contracted capacities 
as a result  average contract occupancy percentages can exceed if the average actual occupancy exceeded contracted capacity 
service capacity for non residential programs is based on either contractual terms or an estimate of the number of clients to be served 
we update these estimates at least annually based on the program s budget and other factors 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from providing adult corrections and treatment and juvenile justice  educational and treatment services outsourced by federal  state and local government agencies in the united states 
revenues for our services are generally recognized on a per diem rate based upon the number of occupant days or hours served for the period  on a guaranteed take or pay basis or on a cost plus reimbursement basis 
for the year ended december   our revenue base consisted of for services provided under per diem contracts  for services provided under take or pay and management contracts  for services provided under cost plus reimbursement contracts  for services provided under fee for service contracts and from other miscellaneous sources 
these percentages are generally consistent with comparable statistics for the years ended december  and revenues can fluctuate from year to year due to changes in government funding policies  changes in the number of clients referred to our facilities by governmental agencies  the opening of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities and the termination of contracts for a facility or the closure of a facility 
revenues for our adult secure institutional services division are primarily generated from per diem  take or pay and management contracts 
for the years ended december   and  we realized average per diem rates on our adult secure institutional facilities of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in the per diem rate for as compared to is due primarily to the opening of the two unit regional correctional center in july and december and the acquisition of the walnut grove youth correctional facility management contract in june additionally  we received per diem rate increases at our big spring correctional center in september and march the decrease in the average per diem rate in as compared to is attributable to a reduction in the per diem rate at a large facility in the second half of as requested by the contracting agency we mitigated a portion of this rate reduction by negotiating reductions in the level of service provided 
we continue to experience increasing pressure from contracting governmental agencies to limit or even reduce per diem rates 
many of these governmental entities are under severe budget pressures and we anticipate that more governmental agencies may approach us about per diem rate concessions 
decreases  or the lack of anticipated increases  in per diem rates could adversely impact our operating margin 
factors considered in determining billing rates to charge include the programs specified by the contract and the related staffing levels  wage levels customary in the respective geographic areas  whether the proposed facility is to be leased or purchased and the anticipated average occupancy levels that could reasonably be maintained 
revenues for our juvenile justice  educational and treatment services division are primarily generated from per diem  fee for service and cost plus reimbursement contracts 
for the years ended december   and  we realized average per diem rates on our residential juvenile justice  educational and treatment facilities of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in the per diem rate for as compared to is due to the opening of the southern peaks regional treatment center in august and rate increases for our pennsylvania programs and facilities in july the decrease in the average per diem rate in as compared to is primarily attributable to the closure of the new morgan academy in the fourth quarter of for the years ended december   and  we realized average fee for service rates for our non residential community based juvenile facilities and programs  including rates that are limited by medicaid and other private insurance providers  of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in the average fee for service rate for as compared to is due to changes in the mix of the services provided by our various juvenile justice  educational and treatment programs and facilities 
the majority of our juvenile services contracts renew annually 
revenues for our adult community based corrections and treatment services division are primarily generated from per diem contracts and fee for service contracts 
for the years ended december   and  we realized average per diem rates on our residential adult corrections and treatment facilities of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in the per diem rate for as compared to is due to mid year rate increases at our alaskan facilities and per diem increases at certain other of our adult community based residential facilities due to contract renewals and other contractual rate increases 
for the years ended december   and  we realized average fee for service rates on our non residential adult community based corrections and treatment facilities and programs of approximately  and  respectively 
our average fee for service rates fluctuate from year to year due to changes in the mix of services provided by our various adult community based programs and facilities 
we have historically experienced higher operating margins in our adult secure institutional services and adult community based corrections and treatment services as compared to the juvenile justice  educational and treatment services division 
additionally  our operating margins within a division can vary from facility to facility based on whether a facility is owned or leased  the level of competition for the contract award  the proposed length of the contract  the occupancy levels for a facility  the level of capital commitment required with respect to a facility  the anticipated changes in operating costs over the term of the contract  and our ability to increase a facility s contract revenue 
a decline in occupancy of certain juvenile justice  educational and treatment facilities can have a more significant impact on operating results than the adult secure institutional services division due to higher per diem rates at certain juvenile facilities 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience interim period operating margin fluctuations due to the number of calendar days in the period  higher payroll taxes in the first half of the year and salary and wage increases and insurance cost increases that are incurred prior to certain contract rate increases 
moveover  many of the governmental agencies with whom we contract are experiencing budget pressures and may approach us to limit or reduce per diem rates 
decreases in  or the lack of anticipated increases in  per diem rates could adversely impact our operating margin 
additionally  a decrease in per diem rates without a corresponding decrease in operating expenses could also adversely affect our operating margin 
we are responsible for all facility operating costs  except for certain debt service and interest or lease payments for facilities where we have a management contract only 
at these facilities  the facility owner is responsible for all debt service and interest or lease payments related to the facility 
we are responsible for all other operating expenses at these facilities 
we operated facilities under management contracts at december   facilities at december  and facilities at december  a majority of our facility operating costs consists of fixed costs 
these fixed costs include lease and rental expense  insurance  utilities and depreciation 
as a result  when we commence operation of new or expanded facilities  fixed operating costs increase 
the amount of our variable operating costs  including food  medical services  supplies and clothing  depend on occupancy levels at the facilities we operate 
our largest single operating cost  facility payroll expense and related employment taxes and expenses  has both a fixed and a variable component 
we can adjust a facility s staffing levels and the related payroll expense to a certain extent based on occupancy at a facility  however a minimum fixed number of employees is required to operate and maintain any facility regardless of occupancy levels 
personnel costs are subject to increases in tightening labor markets based on local economic and other conditions 
we incur pre opening and start up expenses including payroll  benefits  training and other operating costs prior to opening a new or expanded facility and during the period of operation while occupancy is ramping up 
these costs vary by contract 
since pre opening and start up costs are generally factored into the revenue per diem rate that is charged to the contracting agency  we typically expect to recover these upfront costs over the life of the contract 
because occupancy rates during a facility s start up phase typically result in capacity under utilization for at least to days  we may incur additional post opening start up costs 
we do not anticipate post opening start up costs at any adult secure facilities operated under any future contracts with the bop because these contracts are currently and expected to continue to be take or pay contracts  meaning that the bop will pay at least of the contractual monthly revenue once the facility opens  regardless of actual occupancy 
newly opened facilities are staffed according to applicable regulatory or contractual requirements when we begin receiving offenders or clients 
offenders or clients are typically assigned to a newly opened facility on a phased in basis over a one to six month period 
our start up period for new juvenile operations is months from the date we begin recognizing revenue unless break even occupancy levels are achieved before then 
our start up period for new adult operations is nine months from the date we begin recognizing revenue unless break even occupancy levels are achieved before then 
although we typically recover these upfront costs over the life of the contract  quarterly results can be substantially affected by the timing of the commencement of operations as well as the development and construction of new facilities 
working capital requirements generally increase immediately prior to commencing management of a new or expanded facility as we incur start up costs and purchases necessary equipment and supplies before facility management revenue is realized 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs for corporate and administrative personnel who provide senior management  legal  finance  accounting  human resources  payroll and information systems  costs of business development and outside professional and consulting fees 
management overview demand 
our business is driven generally by demand for incarceration or treatment services  and specifically by demand for private incarceration or treatment services  within our three primary business segments adult secure institutional services  juvenile justice  educational and treatment services  and adult community based corrections and treatment services 
the demand for adult and juvenile corrections and treatment services has generally increased at a steady rate over the past ten years  largely as a result of increasingly long sentences and or mandatory sentences for criminals  increasing demand for incarceration of illegal aliens and a public recognition of the need to provide services to juveniles that will improve the possibility that they will lead productive lives 
recent suggestions by social commentators and various political or governmental representatives suggest that community based corrections of adults be emphasized in the future as alternatives to traditional incarceration 
among other things  we monitor federal  state and industry statistics relative to trends in prison populations  juvenile justice statistics and initiatives  and developments in alternatives to traditional incarceration or detention of adults 
the federal government increasingly is turning to private providers for the incarceration of adults whether they are serving prison sentences  detained as illegal aliens  detained in anticipation of pending judicial administration or transitioning from prison to society 
chief among the federal agencies which use private providers are the bop  the bureau of immigration  customs and enforcement  and the us marshals service 
we provide adult secure and adult community based services to the federal government 
most of the federal involvement in juvenile administration in the federal system is handled via medicare and medicaid assistance to state governments 
although there are circumstances in which we may contract with a federal agency on a sole source basis  the primary means by which we secure a contract with a federal agency is via the rfp bidding process 
from time to time  we contract to provide management services to a local governmental unit who then bids on a federal contract 
states and smaller governmental units are divided on the issue of private prisons and private provision of juvenile and community based programs  although a majority of states permit private provision for our services 
we anticipate that increasing budget pressure on states and smaller governmental units will cause more states and smaller governmental units to turn to private providers such as us to provide these services on a more economical basis 
although it varies from governmental unit to governmental unit  the primary political forces who oppose privatization of prisons are organized labor and religious groups 
private juvenile and community based programs are much more widely accepted and utilized by states and local governmental units than private adult prisons 
many private providers are organized on a not for profit basis  but there are a number of large  for profit providers of juvenile and community based programs 
we monitor opportunities in these segments via our corporate and regional development officials 
many opportunities are not published in any manner and  accordingly  we believe that taking the initiative at the state and local levels is key in developing sole source opportunities  which have become a focus of our company 
performance 
we track a number of factors as we monitor financial performance 
chief among them are capacity the number of beds within each business segment s facilities occupancy utilization per diem reimbursement rates operating expenses capacity  commonly expressed in terms of a number of beds  is primarily impacted by the number and size of the facilities we own or lease and the facilities which are not owned or leased but which are operated by us on behalf of a third party owner or lessee 
we view capacity primarily as a measure of our development efforts  which may increase capacity by adding new projects or adding to existing projects 
as part of measuring our development efforts  we will assess a whether a given development project was brought into service in accordance with our expectation as to time and expense  and b the number of projects in development at the relevant point in time 
in addition to the focus on new projects  capacity will reflect our success in renewing and maintaining existing contracts and facilities 
recently  we have been confronted with the possibility that state or local budgetary limitations may cause the contractual commitment to a given facility to be reduced or even eliminated  which would cause us to secure an alternate customer or close the operation 
occupancy is typically expressed in terms of percentage of contract capacity utilized 
we look at occupancy to assess the efficacy of both our efforts to market our facilities and our efforts to retain existing customers or contracts 
because revenue varies directly with occupancy  occupancy is a driver of our revenues 
some of our contracts are take or pay  meaning that the agency making use of the facility is obligated to pay for beds even though they are not used 
historically  occupancy percentages have been high and we are mindful of the need to maintain high occupancy levels 
as new development projects are brought into service  occupancy percentages may decline until the projects reach full utilization 
where we have commitments for utilization before the commencement of operations  occupancy percentages reflects the speed at which a facility achieves full service implementation 
however  we may undertake development projects without written commitments to make full use of a facility 
in these instances  we have performed our own assessment  based on discussions with local government representatives and analysis of other factors  of the demand for services at the facility 
there is no assurance that we will recover our initial investment in these projects 
we will monitor occupancy as a measure of the accuracy of our estimation of the demand for the services of a development facility 
per diem reimbursement rates are the other key element of our gross revenue and operating margin since per diem contracts represent a majority of our revenues for the year ended december  
per diem rates are a function of negotiation between management and a governmental unit at the inception of a contract or through the rfp process 
actual per diem rates vary dramatically across our business segments  and then within each business segment depending upon the particular service or program provided 
the initial per diem rates often change during the term of a contract in accordance with a schedule 
the amount of the change can be a fixed amount set forth within the contract  an amount determined by formulas set forth within the contract or an amount determined by negotiations between management and the governmental unit often these negotiations are along the same lines as the original per diem negotiation a review of expenses and approval of an amount to recompense for expenses and assure the potential of an operating profit 
in recent years  as budgetary pressures on governmental units have increased  some of our governmental customers have negotiated relief from formulaic increase provisions within their agreements or have declined to include in their appropriation legislation amounts that would increase the per diem rates payable under the contract needed in some cases to offset operating expense increases 
although we have mitigated a portion of the impact of these developments by negotiating services provided or obtaining commitments for increased volume  we have taken steps primarily in the area of legislative and governmental monitoring and lobbying to avoid these sorts of adverse developments in the future 
we will continue to monitor per diem rates as a measure of negotiation skill  customer service  management and maintenance  political and business astuteness 
we track several different areas of our operating expenses 
foremost among these expenses are employee compensation and benefits and expenses  risk related areas such as general liability  medical and worker s compensation  client inmate costs such as food  clothing and programming costs  financing costs and administrative overhead expenses 
increases or decreases in one or more of these items  such as our recent experience with rising insurance costs  can have a material effect on our financial performance 
we are particularly monitoring the costs of complying with the sarbanes oxley act of  both in terms of fees paid to third parties  such as independent auditors and consultants  as well as internal administrative costs 
we recognize that our operating margins are subject to pressure from a variety of factors  but most notably rising costs and governmental and agency budgetary constraints 
we also believe that successful development of higher margin and low capital projects is key to mitigating such pressure 
we have several development projects committed and in various stages of completion 
until those projects are completed and brought into full service  we will monitor operations and existing customer relationships in an attempt to minimize the duration of start up periods and the related pressure on operating margins 
significant events acquisition of the walnut grove youth correctional facility management contract in june  we acquired a management contract to operate a bed secure youth offender correctional facility in walnut grove  mississippi  the walnut grove youth correctional facility  from tuscolameta  inc this facility houses year old males and provides academic and vocational training  along with drug and alcohol education and treatment 
group and individual counseling and recreational opportunities are also provided 
the management contract has a remaining term of years with a renewal option for an additional two year term 
we acquired the management contract and certain assets and liabilities for a total purchase price of approximately million  which was allocated as follows in thousands accounts receivable contract value prepaid supplies fixed assets non compete agreement accounts payable and accrued liabilities net assets the fair market value of the management contract was determined based on projected discounted future cash flows 
we are amortizing the management contract value of approximately million over the expected useful life of the management contract of years 
the expected useful life of the contract includes two one year options 
amortization expense was approximately million for the year ended december  southern peaks regional treatment center on january   we initiated legal proceedings in the lawsuit styled cornell corrections of california  inc v 
longboat global advisors  llc  et al  no 
cv in the superior court of fulton county  georgia under theories of fraud  conversion  breach of contract and other theories to determine the location of and to recover funds previously deposited by us into what we believed to be an escrow account in connection with the development and construction of the southern peaks regional treatment center 
of the funds previously deposited  approximately million remains to be recovered at december  in december  the case was tried before a jury and the jury returned a verdict awarding approximately million in compensatory damages and approximately million in punitive damages  plus attorney s fees 
currently  we expect the defendants to move for a new trial and that no judgment will be entered on the verdict until after these motions for a new trial have been heard and ruled on by the court 
if the court denies any filed motions for a new trial and enters a judgment on the jury verdict we expect that the actual damages awarded under the verdict will be adjusted downward to the million actually lost by us and that the punitive damages award may be adjusted downward because of a georgia statute regarding caps on punitive damages awards 
the award for compensatory damages accrues pre judgment interest at a rate of percent from the date of loss through the date of judgment 
following the jury verdicts  we collected approximately million in january in funds which had been previously frozen under a temporary restraining order issued at the time that we commenced this litigation 
due to the continued uncertainty surrounding any motions for a new trial and the ultimate recovery of the funds previously deposited  we will continue to maintain our existing reserve on the receivable of approximately million in an allowance for doubtful accounts 
construction of the southern peaks regional treatment center was substantially completed in july we purchased the property in september and served as the construction supervisor in lieu of the developer and assumed the developer s rights and obligations under the construction contract except that the developer remained as contractor for certain of the infrastructure serving the facility 
as of december   we had invested approximately million in the property and related furniture and equipment 
the facility began receiving clients in august we currently anticipate that the facility will be fully ramped up during the second half of new morgan academy we closed the new morgan academy in the fourth quarter of and are currently considering several options ranging from the utilization of the facility for another type of program or the sale or lease of the facility 
as of december   we are focusing our efforts on the possible sale or lease of the facility to certain governmental agencies in pennsylvania  as well as private enterprises 
we are maintaining a small staff to secure and maintain the facility 
we have recognized pre tax costs of million including an impairment charge of million as discussed below in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  for related holding costs depreciation  interest  property  taxes and other maintenance costs 
at december   as a result of our analysis pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 we determined that the carrying amount of the new morgan academy was not fully recoverable and exceeded its fair value as based on current estimates of future cash flows 
the developing inability during late of various governmental agencies with whom we have been in negotiations to obtain the level of funding to contract with us for the use of the new morgan academy has indicated an expectation of continuing losses associated with this facility 
accordingly  we believe that  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 an impairment charge of million was required and such charge has been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  the carrying value of the property and equipment for the new morgan academy  after the impairment charge  was approximately million at december  las vegas center in june  the bop issued a request for proposal rfp for the operation of a bed adult community based correctional center in clark county  nevada 
we submitted a proposal in september and received requests for clarifications to our proposal in january and february we purchased a building in january in anticipation of winning the contract award 
we were awarded the contract in july and assumed the contract from the previous operator in december the initial contract is for two years with three one year renewal options and will generate an estimated million in annualized revenue 
the population for the contract will consist of adult females and adult males 
we purchased and renovated the facility at a cost of approximately million and have increased the service capacity of the facility to beds 
central california treatment center in january  we purchased a building in los angeles  california for approximately million 
upon the successful award of a contract to utilize this facility  we anticipate incurring renovation costs of approximately million 
this new facility could provide service to inmates in a work furlough type program 
although we do not currently have a contract for this facility it has been submitted for consideration in several recent proposals 
we believe that due to the growth of the inmate population  severe budget crisis and recent legal settlements requiring additional community services  this facility will fill a small part of the overall demand in california 
the potential uses for the facility range from a halfway back program to a comprehensive drug and alcohol treatment program 
plankinton regional detention center the plankinton regional detention center  a bed juvenile justice center in south dakota  was activated early in may and the plankinton regional treatment center was scheduled to open in august we based our plans to open and operate these leased facilities on a commitment from the appropriate state officials to create a special rate that would allow us to meet the needs of clients rejected by other providers in the state 
however  we learned we were awarded an initial rate that  was insufficient to support the level of care and treatment required for the center s clients 
as a result  we suspended operations at the detention center in august and delayed the opening of the treatment center 
in october  we determined that the per diem rate necessary to provide the appropriate level of services to the clients was not forthcoming and we decided to withdraw from the south dakota market 
the impact of our decision to withdraw from the south dakota market with respect to the carrying value of the related assets was not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
moshannon valley correctional center in march  we reached an agreement with the commonwealth of pennsylvania that resolved all outstanding administrative issues relative to the contract awarded by the bop to operate the moshannon valley correctional center 
in october  we received the signed finding of no significant impact for the facility 
construction of the facility  which will house  male federal inmates  began immediately 
we have a three year contract with the bop to operate the facility and the bop has the option to grant seven one year extensions 
the facility is scheduled to begin operations in early in september  we resolved our claim with the bop for the reimbursement of a portion of the expenses we incurred in connection with the issuance of the stop work order and the delay of the project included among these expenses was approximately million in accounts receivable for expenses incurred by us after the september issuance of the stop work order 
we settled the claim  as well as the claim for the reimbursement of costs related to the original construction efforts incurred beginning in  with the bop and were reimbursed approximately million in september the excess reimbursement of approximately million over the million in accounts receivable was credited against the carrying cost of the facility 
as of december   we had incurred net of the bop reimbursement approximately million for the design  construction and development costs and capitalized interest related to the moshannon valley correctional center facility 
we estimate an additional capital investment including furniture and equipment of approximately million is required to complete construction of the facility 
we believe that our existing cash and credit facilities will provide adequate funding to complete the construction of the facility 
regional correctional center in january  we executed a five year lease for the regional correctional center in albuquerque  new mexico 
this bed facility consists of two units  the bed south tower and the bed north tower 
we renovated the south tower and opened the unit in july we renovated the north tower and opened the unit in december as of december   we had invested approximately million on renovations and furniture and equipment for both towers 
for the year ended december   we incurred pre opening and start up costs of approximately million and recognized revenue of approximately million related to this facility 
we currently anticipate that the facility will reach substantial occupancy during the second half of however  there can be no assurance that we will develop enough volume at the facility to assure its profitability 
the lease for the facility requires monthly rental payments of approximately  for the first two years and  for the last three years of the lease 
credit facility and senior notes in june  we entered into a revolving credit facility the credit facility by and among the company and other lenders to fund working capital for acquisitions  to refinance existing debt  to fund capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
also in june  we issued million in principal senior notes the senior notes due july  the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes of approximately million were used to repay and refinance the indebtedness under our amended credit facility and the synthetic lease investor notes a and b as of june  refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources long term credit facilities for a detailed discussion concerning the credit facility and the senior notes 
philadelphia alternative education in july  we signed a five year agreement to provide alternative education services to rd and th grade students in school districts for the school district of philadelphia beginning the academic year which began in august class sizes will be limited to students for a total of students

we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements

in evaluating the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts  we make judgments regarding our customers ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may occur 
if  after reasonable collection efforts have been made  a receivable is determined to be permanently uncollectible  it will be written off 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retention under self insurance programs 
we regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for these losses through insurance reserves 
these reserves are influenced by rising costs of health care and other costs  increases in claims  time lags in claims information and levels of insurance coverage carried 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available to us  adjustments to the related loss reserves may occur 
our reserves for medical and worker s compensation claims are subject to change based on our estimate of the number and the magnitude of claims to be incurred 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances or a triggering event indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets to be held and used be reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value 
assets to be disposed of by sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated cost to sell 
we estimate fair value based upon the best information available  which may include discounted expected future cash flows to be produced by the assets and or available market prices 
factors that significantly influence estimated future cash flows include the periods and levels of occupancy for the facility  expected per diem or reimbursement rates  assumptions regarding the levels of staffing  services and future operating and capital expenditures necessary to generate forecasted revenues  related costs for these activities and future rate of increases or decreases associated with these factors 
we also consider the results of any appraisals on the properties when assessing fair value 
these estimates are highly subjective  particularly in circumstances where there is no current operating contract in place and changes in the assumptions and estimates could result in the recognition of impairment charges 
the most subjective estimates made in this analysis for relate to the new morgan academy  the residential school and the maple creek home and for relate to the new morgan academy and the moshannon valley correctional center 
we may be required to record an impairment charge in the future should we not be able to successfully negotiate a contract on any of our facilities that we do currently have an operating contract 
accounting for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we have elected to account for our stock based compensation plans under the intrinsic method established by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 stock based employee compensation cost is not reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to or in excess of the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  that requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and other types of equity based compensation at the fair value of the options at the award s grant date based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
compensation cost for awards that vest would not be reversed if the awards expire without being exercised 
when measuring fair value  companies can choose an option pricing model eg  black sholes or binominal models that approximately reflects their specific circumstances and the economics of their transactions 
companies will recognize compensation cost per share based payment awards as they vest  including the related tax effects 
the effective date applies to interim and annual periods beginning after june   and applies to all outstanding and unvested share based payment awards at the adoption date 
we are currently evaluating the alternative transition methods permitted by sfas no

goodwill we account for our goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which states that there will be no amortization of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives 
impairment of these assets is assessed at least annually to determine if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the net carrying value of the reporting unit  including the applicable goodwill 
the estimates of fair market value are based upon our estimates of the present value of future cash flows 
we make assumptions regarding the estimated cash flows and if these estimates or their related assumptions change  an impairment charge may be incurred

long term credit facilities 
our credit facility  as amended  provided for borrowings of up to million under a revolving line of credit 
the commitment amount was reduced by million quarterly beginning in july and by outstanding letters of credit 
the amended credit facility bore interest  at our election  at either the prime rate plus a margin of  or a rate which was above the applicable libor rate 
additionally  the amended credit facility provided us with the ability to enter into synthetic lease agreements for the acquisition or development of operating facilities 
this synthetic lease financing arrangement provided for funding to the lessor under the operating leases of up to million 
the amended credit facility was repaid with a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes in june on june   we entered into a revolving credit facility the credit facility by and among the company  and certain other lenders to fund working capital for acquisitions  to refinance existing debt  to fund capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
the credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million under a revolving line of credit  and is reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
the available commitment under the credit facility was approximately million at december  we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million at december  subject to certain requirements  we have the right to increase the aggregate commitments under the credit facility up to an aggregate amount of million 
the credit facility matures in june and bears interest  at our election and  depending on our total leverage ratio  at either the prime rate plus a margin ranging from to  or a rate which ranges from to above the applicable libor rate 
the credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including the assets and stock of all of our subsidiaries 
the credit facility is not secured by the assets of mcf 
the credit facility contains standard covenants including compliance with laws  limitations on capital expenditures  restrictions on dividend payments  limitations on mergers and compliance with financial covenants 
in june  we issued million in principal of senior notes the senior notes due july  the senior notes are unsecured senior indebtedness and are guaranteed by all of our existing and future subsidiaries collectively  the guarantors 
the senior notes are not guaranteed by mcf the non guarantor 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on january and july of each year  commencing january  on or after july   we may redeem all or a portion of the senior notes at the redemption prices expressed as a percentage of the principal amount listed below  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on the senior notes redeemed  to the applicable date of redemption  if redeemed during the month period commencing on july of the years indicated below year percentages and thereafter any time prior to july   we may redeem up to of the original aggregate principal amount of the senior notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof with the net cash of public offerings of equity  provided that at least of the original aggregate principal amount of the senior notes remains outstanding after the redemption and other conditions are met 
upon the occurrence of specified change of control events  unless we have exercised our option to redeem all the senior notes as described above  each holder will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s senior notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on the senior notes repurchased  to the applicable date of purchase 
the senior notes were issued under an indenture the indenture which limits our ability and our guarantors to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  make other restricted payments and investments  create liens  incur restrictions on the ability of the guarantors to pay dividends or other payments to us  enter into transactions with affiliates  and engage in mergers  consolidations and certain sales of assets 
the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes was approximately million and was used to repay and refinance the indebtedness under our amended credit facility and our synthetic lease obligations as of june  we recognized a charge of approximately million related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and charges related to the extinguishment of the synthetic lease and the amended credit facility obligations 
in conjunction with the issuance of the senior notes  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with a financial institution to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value on million of our senior notes 
the purpose of this transaction was to convert future interest due on million of the senior notes to a variable rate 
the terms of the interest rate swap contract and the underlying debt instrument are identical 
we have designated the swap agreement as a fair value hedge 
the swap has a notional amount of million and matures in july to mirror the maturity of the senior notes 
under the agreement  we pay on a semi annual basis each january and july a floating rate based on a six month us dollar libor rate  plus a spread  and receive a fixed rate interest of 
for the year ended december   we recorded interest savings related to this interest rate swap of approximately million which is reflected as a reduction to interest expense in our accompanying financial statements 
the swap agreements are marked to market each quarter with a corresponding mark to market adjustment reflected as either a discount or premium on the senior notes 
at december   the fair value of this derivative instrument was approximately million and is included in other assets 
the carrying value of the senior notes as of december  was increased by the same amount 
because the swap agreement is considered an effective fair value hedge  there will be no effect on our results of operations from the mark to market adjustment as long as the swap is in effect 
contractual uncertainties related to certain facilities 
regional correctional center 
in january  we executed a five year lease for the regional correctional center in albuquerque  new mexico 
this bed facility consists of two units  the bed south tower and the bed north tower 
we renovated the south tower and opened the unit in july we renovated the north tower and opened the unit in december as of december   we had invested approximately million on renovations and furniture and equipment for both towers 
for the year ended december   we incurred pre opening and start up expenses of approximately million and recognized revenue of approximately million related to this facility 
we currently anticipate that the facility will reach substantial capactity during the second half of however  there can be no assurance that we will develop enough volume at the facility to assure its profitability 
the lease for the facility requires monthly rental payments of approximately  for the first two years and  for the last three years of the lease 
new morgan academy 
we closed the new morgan academy in the fourth quarter of and are currently considering several options ranging from the utilization of the facility for another type of program or the sale or lease of the facility 
as of december   we are focusing our efforts on the possible sale or lease of the facility to certain governmental agencies in pennsylvania  as well as private enterprises 
we are maintaining a small staff to secure and maintain the facility 
we have recognized pre tax costs of million including an impairment charge of million as discussed below in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  for related holding costs depreciation  interest  property  taxes and other maintenance costs 
at december   as a result of our analysis pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 we determined that the carrying amount of the new morgan academy was not fully recoverable and exceeded its fair value as based on current estimates of future cash flows 
the developing inability during late of various governmental agencies with whom we have been in negotiations to obtain the level of funding to contract with us for the use of the new morgan academy has indicated an expectation of continuing losses associated with this facility 
accordingly  we believe that  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 an impairment charge of million was required and such charge has been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  the carrying value of the property and equipment at the new morgan academy  after the impairment charge  was approximately million at december  this facility is a part of our juvenile segment 
treasury stock repurchases 
we repurchased in the open market  shares of our common stock for approximately million in the year ended december  we repurchased in the open market  shares of our common stock for approximately million in the year ended december  in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an aggregate million of the company s outstanding shares 
the annual repurchase of shares was limited to million  and an aggregate limit of million  under the amended credit facility 
under the terms of the senior notes and the credit facility  we can purchase shares of our stock subject to certain cumulative restrictions 
future liquidity 
we believe that the existing cash and the cash flows generated from operations  together with the credit available under our credit facility  will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our committed capital and working capital requirements for currently awarded and certain potential future development contracts  including the construction of the moshannon valley correctional center 
to the extent our cash and current financing arrangements do not provide sufficient financing to fund construction costs related to future adult secure institutional contract awards or significant facility expansions  we anticipate obtaining additional sources of financing to fund such activities 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available or will be available on terms favorable to us 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
we have assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of conducting our business 
we have contractual obligations requiring future cash payments under our existing contractual arrangements  such as management  consulting and non competition agreements 
we maintain operating leases in the ordinary course of our business activities 
these leases include those for operating facilities  office space and office and operating equipment  and the terms of the agreements vary from until as of december   our total commitment under these operating leases was approximately million 
the following table details the known future cash payments on an undiscounted basis related to various contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total thereafter contractual obligations long term debt principal and interest cornell companies  inc special purpose entities construction commitments capital lease obligations cornell companies  inc operating leases consultative and non competition agreements total contractual cash obligations the future cash payments on the cornell companies  inc long term debt assume an effective rate of on the interest rate swap contract 
we enter into letters of credit in the ordinary course of operating and financing activities 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million primarily for certain workers compensation insurance and other operating obligations 
the following table details our letter of credit commitments as of december  in thousands amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than over committed year years years years commercial commitments standby letters of credit related party transactions one of our directors is a partner in a law firm that provides legal services to us 
we pay legal fees for such services 
legal fees paid to this law firm were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this director has notified us that he will not stand for reelection at the next stockholders meeting 
in july  we entered into promissory notes with the company s former president and the company s founder  a director of the company until october the promissory notes bore interest at an annual rate of  were scheduled to mature in june with no interim interest or principal payments  were full recourse and were collateralized by shares of our common stock 
these notes were repaid in total prior to december  in october  the principal and related accrued interest receivable related to the company founder s notes of  and  respectively  was repaid 
we recognized approximately  and  of interest income related to these notes for the years ended december   and effective september   we entered into a consulting agreement with the company s founder  who was a director of the company through october as compensation for consulting services  we agreed to an annual payment of at least  for each of the first four years of the seven year initial term of the consulting agreement with an annual payment of at least  for each of the last three years of the seven year initial term of the consulting agreement 
we have an option to renew the consulting agreement for an additional three year term at an annual salary of at least  for each of the three years of the renewal term 
as additional compensation  we agreed to an annual bonus  subject to certain limitations  equal to  during the first four years of the seven year initial term and an annual bonus of  during the last three years of the seven year initial term and during any renewal term 
we also agreed to grant options to purchase an aggregate  shares of our common stock in four equal annual installments beginning september  the options have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and vest at the time such options are granted  subject to certain limitations on exercise 
for the year ended december   the company s founder accepted a  cash payment in lieu of unexercised options 
this payment was expensed by us in as part of the consulting agreement discussed above  we entered into a non compete agreement with the company s founder 
the non compete agreement has a term of years and requires us to pay a monthly fee of  for the seven year initial term of the consulting agreement 
we capitalize the monthly payments and amortize the amounts over the year term of the consulting agreement 
we recognized amortization expense related to this agreement of approximately  for each of the years ended december   and we maintain a life insurance policy for the company s founder and made payments related to this policy of approximately million for each of the years ended december   and we also compensated the company s founder for board of director fees in the amounts of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we did not pay director fees in as the company s founder resigned as a director in october total payments made for the above consulting and non compete agreements  board of director fees and expense reimbursements for the company s founder were approximately million for the year ended december  and million for each of the years ended december  and we also had a non compete agreement with a director of the company in connection with the acquisition of the abraxas group  inc in september under this agreement  we were required to pay annual installments of  beginning january  these payments could and were accelerated upon the mutual agreement of the director and us 
as of december   the balance on this non compete agreement had been paid in full 
we made payments under this agreement of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this director resigned from the board of directors in june subsequent to their resignation  we entered into a consulting agreement with this former director for a term which expires in december total payments under this agreement  which has a termination fee incorporated for a termination prior to maturity  totaled million in the termination fee at december was million 
inflation other than personnel  offender medical costs at certain facilities  and employee medical and worker s compensation insurance costs  we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
most of our facility management contracts provide for payments of either fixed per diem fees or per diem fees that increase by only small amounts during the term of the contracts 
inflation could substantially increase our personnel costs the largest component of our operating expenses  medical and insurance costs or other operating expenses at rates faster than any increases in contract revenues

with this in mind  you should consider the risks discussed below and elsewhere in this report and other documents we file with the commission from time to time and the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by us or on our behalf 
resistance to privatization of correctional and detention facilities could result in our inability to obtain new contracts or the loss of existing contracts 
management of correctional and detention facilities  particularly of adult secure facilities  by private entities has not achieved complete acceptance by either the government or the public 
the movement toward privatization of correctional and detention facilities has also encountered resistance from certain groups  such as labor unions  local sheriff s departments  religious organizations and groups believing that correctional and detention facility operations should only be conducted by government agencies 
changes in the dominant political party in any market in which correctional facilities are located could have an adverse impact on privatization 
furthermore  some government agencies are not legally permitted to delegate their traditional management responsibilities for correctional and detention facilities to private companies 
in addition  as a private prison manager  we are subject to government legislation and regulation restricting the ability of private prison managers to house certain types of inmates  such as inmates from other jurisdictions or inmates at medium or higher security levels 
legislation has been enacted in several states  and has previously been proposed in the united states house of representatives  containing such restrictions 
any such legislation may have a material adverse affect on us 
any of these resistances may make it more difficult for us to renew or maintain existing contracts  to obtain new contracts or sites on which to operate new facilities or to develop or purchase facilities and lease them to government or private entities  any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to the short term nature of government contracts 
many governmental agencies are legally limited in their ability to enter into long term contracts that would bind elected officials responsible for future budgets 
therefore  many contracts with government agencies typically either have a very short term or are subject to termination on short notice without cause 
the majority of our contracts have primary terms of one to three years 
in addition  our contracts with governmental agencies may contain one or more renewal options that may be exercised only by the contracting government agency 
no assurance can be given that any agency will exercise a renewal option in the future 
some of these contracts may not be renewed by the corresponding governmental agency and no assurance can be given that any agency will exercise a renewal option in the future 
the non renewal or termination of any of our significant contracts with governmental agencies could materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operation and liquidity  including our ability to secure new facility management contracts from others 
to the extent we have made significant capital expenditures and have short term contracts with our customers that are not renewed or extended  we may not recover our entire capital investment 
budgetary pressure on federal  state and local governments may result in contract cancellation or a reduction in per diem rates  which would reduce our profitability 
our cash flow is subject to the receipt of sufficient funding of and timely payment by contracting governmental entities 
if the appropriate government agency does not receive sufficient appropriations to cover its contractual obligations  a contract may be terminated or the amounts payable to us may be deferred or reduced 
federal  state and local governments have encountered  and are expected to continue to encounter  significant budgetary constraints that may result in a reduction of spending on the outsourced services that we provide 
such budgetary limitations may cause the contractual commitments to be reduced or even eliminated  which would make it unprofitable to continue operating a certain facility and require us to find alternate customers or close such facility 
many states are facing significant budget deficits and are under pressure to reduce current levels of spending or control additional spending 
as a result of this increased budgetary pressure  we have granted a few of our customers relief from formulaic increase provisions in their agreements and some of our customers have not included in their appropriation legislation amounts that would increase the per diem rates payable to us 
contractual rate increases are generally intended to offset increases in expenses and inflation 
to the extent rates are not increased or are reduced  our profitability will be adversely affected 
our ability to win new contracts to develop and manage correctional  detention and treatment facilities depends on many factors outside our control 
our growth is generally dependent upon our ability to win new contracts to develop and manage new correctional  detention and treatment facilities 
this depends on a number of factors we cannot control  including crime rates and sentencing patterns in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  the demand for our facilities could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts  leniency in conviction and sentencing practices or through the legal decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws 
for instance  changes in laws relating to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could reduce the number of persons arrested  convicted and sentenced  thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them and community based services to transition offenders back into the community 
similarly  reductions in crime rates could lead to reductions in arrests  convictions and sentences requiring correctional facilities 
when seeking bids  most governmental entities evaluate the financial strength of the bidders 
to the extent they believe we do not have sufficient financial resources  we will be unable to effectively compete for bids 
additionally  our success in obtaining new awards and contracts may depend  in part  upon our ability to locate land that can be leased or acquired on favorable terms 
furthermore  desirable locations may be in or near populated areas and  therefore  may generate legal action or other forms of opposition from residents in areas surrounding a proposed site 
our profitability may suffer if the number of offenders occupying our correctional  detention and treatment facilities decreases or there is a shift in occupancy among our divisions 
our correctional  detention and treatment facilities are dependent upon governmental agencies supplying offenders and we do not control occupancy levels at our facilities 
we believe the rate of growth experienced in the adult secure sector during the late s and early s is stabilizing 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated under contracts that specify a net rate per day per resident  or a per diem rate  sometimes with no minimum guaranteed occupancy levels  even though most correctional facility cost structures are relatively fixed 
under such a per diem rate structure  a decrease in occupancy levels at a particular facility could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations at such facility 
a decrease in the occupancy of certain juvenile justice  education and treatment facilities would have a more significant impact on our operating results than a decrease in occupancy in the adult secure institutional services division due to higher per diem revenue at certain juvenile facilities 
recent suggestions by social commentators and various political or governmental representatives suggest that community based corrections of adults may be emphasized in the future as alternatives to traditional incarceration 
we have historically experienced higher operating margins in the adult secure institutional services and the adult community based corrections and treatment services sectors than in the juvenile services sector 
a shift in occupancy among our segments of business operations could result in a decrease in our profitability 
a failure to comply with existing regulations could result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of our facility management contracts 
our industry is subject to a variety of federal  state and local regulations  including education  environmental  health care and safety regulations  which are administered by various regulatory authorities 
we may not always successfully comply with these regulations  and failure to comply could result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of facility management contracts 
the contracts typically include extensive reporting requirements and supervision and on site monitoring by representatives of contracting governmental agencies 
corrections officers are customarily required to meet certain training standards  and in some instances facility personnel are required to be licensed and subject to background investigation 
certain jurisdictions also require that subcontracts be awarded on a competitive basis or that we subcontract with businesses owned by members of minority groups 
the failure to comply with any applicable laws  rules or regulations and the loss of any required license could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations at our affected facilities 
governmental agencies may investigate and audit our contracts and  if any improprieties are found  we may be required to refund revenues we have received  and or to forego anticipated revenues and may be subject to penalties and sanctions  including prohibitions on our bidding in response to requests for proposals  or rfps 
governmental agencies we contract with have the authority to audit and investigate our contracts with them 
as part of that process  some governmental agencies review our performance on the contract  our pricing practices  our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if the agency determines that we have improperly allocated costs to a specific contract  we may not be reimbursed for those costs and we could be required to refund the amount of any such costs that have been reimbursed 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities by us or we otherwise determine that these activities have occurred  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government 
any adverse determination could adversely impact our ability to bid in response to rfps in one or more jurisdictions and significantly reduce the probability of our success in the bid process for future contracts 
if we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations  our ability to compete for future contracts and our financial condition may be adversely affected 
our failure to comply with contract requirements or to meet our client s performance expectations when performing a contract could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation  which  in turn  would impact our ability to compete for new contracts 
our failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential damages 
in addition  our contracts often require us to indemnify clients for our failure to meet performance standards 
some of our contracts contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to performance failures 
although we have liability insurance  the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all potential liabilities 
competitors in our industry may adversely affect the profitability of our business 
we must compete with government entities and other private operators on the basis of cost  quality and range of services offered  experience in managing facilities  reputation of personnel and ability to design  finance and construct new facilities on a cost effective competitive basis 
while there are barriers for companies seeking to enter into the management and operation of correctional  detention and treatment facilities  there can be no assurance that these barriers will be sufficient to limit additional competition 
certain areas of our operation may not pose a significant barrier to entry into the market by private operators 
for example  private operators may not find it as difficult to bid for juvenile treatment  educational and detention services and pre release correctional and treatment services as they do adult secure institutional  correctional and detention services 
further  our government customers may assume the management of a facility currently managed by us upon the termination of the corresponding management contract or  if such customers have capacity at their facilities  may take inmates currently housed in our facilities and transfer them to government run facilities 
the resulting decrease in occupancy levels would reduce our revenue due to the per diem rate structure and could result in a significant decrease in the profitability of our business 
a disturbance or violent occurrence in one of our facilities could result in closure of a facility or harm to our business 
an escape  riot  disturbance or violent occurrence at one of our facilities could adversely affect the financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of our operations 
among other things  the negative publicity generated as a result of an event could adversely affect our ability to retain an existing contract or obtain future ones 
in addition  if such an event were to occur  there is a possibility that the facility where the event occurred may be shut down by the relevant governmental agency 
a closure of certain of our facilities could adversely affect the financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of our operations 
such negative events may also result in a significant increase in our liability insurance costs 
negative media coverage  including inaccurate or misleading information  could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to bid for government contracts 
the media frequently focuses its attention on private operators contracts with governmental agencies 
if the media coverage of private operators is negative  it could influence government officials to slow the pace of outsourcing government services  which could reduce the number of rfps 
the media may also focus its attention on the activities of political consultants engaged by us  even when their activities are unrelated to our business  and we may be tainted by adverse media coverage about their activities 
moreover  inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage about us could harm our reputation and  accordingly  our ability to bid for and win government contracts 
we often incur significant costs before receiving related revenues  which could result in cash shortfalls and a risk of not recovering our investment 
when we are awarded a contract to manage a new facility  we may incur significant expenses before we receive contract payments 
these expenses include purchasing real estate  constructing new facilities  leasing office space  purchasing office equipment and hiring and training personnel 
as a result  when the government does not fund a facility s pre opening and start up costs  we may be required to invest significant sums of money before receiving related contract payments 
in addition  payments due to us from governmental agencies may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures by our governmental customers to attain necessary budget approvals and finalize contracts in a timely manner 
several juvenile services contracts related to educational services provide for annual collection several months after a school year is completed 
in addition  a contract may be terminated prior to its scheduled expiration and as a result we may not recover these expenses or realize any return on our investment 
we may choose to undertake development projects without written commitments to make use of such facilities 
we may not be able to obtain contracts for these facilities in a timely fashion  if at all 
to the extent we do not obtain contracts  we could be unable to recover our investment and our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we may be unable to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel necessary to sustain our business 
our delivery of services is labor intensive 
when we are awarded a contract  we must hire operating management  security  case management and other personnel 
the success of our business requires that we attract  develop  motivate and retain these personnel 
our ability to recruit and retain qualified individuals varies by facility and is related to the socio economic factors in the particular community in which the facility operates 
often the department of labor wages we offer our employees are higher than wages they may obtain elsewhere in the community 
however  if the local economy where a facility is located is robust and unemployment is low  we may have difficulty hiring and retaining qualified personnel 
this was one of the factors that contributed to our closure of the new morgan academy 
in addition  there are inherent risks associated with the nature of the services we provide and this could cause certain qualified individuals to seek other employment opportunities 
we have experienced high turnover of personnel in our juvenile facilities within the first year of their employment 
our inability to hire sufficient personnel on a timely basis or the loss of significant numbers of personnel could adversely affect our business 
if we do not successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may be unable to manage businesses that we may acquire profitably or integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses  delays or other problems that could negatively impact our results of operations 
acquisitions generally require the integration of facilities  some of which may be located in states in which we do not currently have operations 
we announced the signing of a definitive agreement on january  to acquire correctional systems  inc for approximately million 
we anticipate that the transaction will be completed in the second quarter of this acquisition would require us to integrate a company that has operations in multiple states 
moreover  business combinations involve additional risks  including diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel  assumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities  our becoming significantly leveraged as a result of the incurrence of debt to finance an acquisition  unanticipated operating  accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities  amortization or charges of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  and dilution to our earnings per share 
also  client dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business could materially and adversely affect our reputation as a whole 
further  the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenues and earnings we anticipated 
because environmental laws impose strict as well as joint and several liability for clean up costs  unforeseen environmental risks could prove to be costly 
our facilities  and any facilities that we may acquire in the future  may be subject to unforeseen environmental risks 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended  or cercla  imposes strict  as well as joint and several  liability for certain environmental cleanup costs on several classes of potentially responsible parties  including current owners and operators of the property 
other federal and state laws in certain circumstances may impose liability for environmental remediation  which costs may be substantial 
further  the operation of our facilities  and the development of new facilities  requires that we obtain  and comply with  permits and other authorizations under environmental laws 
obtaining such permits and authorizations can prove to be difficult and time consuming 
we are the subject of class action lawsuits that  if decided against us  could have a negative effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and future prospects 
in march and april  we  our former president and chief executive officer and our former chief financial officer were named as defendants in four federal putative class action lawsuits 
these lawsuits were brought on behalf of all purchasers of our common stock between march  and march  and relate to our restatement in of certain financial statements 
the lawsuits involved disclosures made concerning two prior transactions executed by us the sale and leaseback transaction and the synthetic lease transaction 
these four lawsuits were consolidated into one action and an amended consolidated complaint was filed 
the amended consolidated complaint seeks  among other things  restitution damages  compensatory damages  rescission or a rescissory measure of damages  costs  expenses  attorneys fees and expert fees 
in may and june  we and our directors were sued in certain other derivative lawsuits 
these lawsuits relate to our restatement in of certain financial statements 
these lawsuits all allege breaches of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets by all of the defendants 
the plaintiffs in these cases have not quantified their claim of damages and the outcome of the matters discussed above cannot be predicted with certainty 
if an adverse decision in these matters exceeds our insurance coverage or if our insurance coverage is deemed not to apply to these matters  an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect onus  our financial condition  our results of operations and our future prospects 
we have in the past incurred  and may continue to incur  significant expenses for facilities that we no longer operate 
if we close a facility  we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease  which would include  among other things  payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term 
we may also be required to incur other expenses with respect to such facilities 
the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open underperforming facilities 
as a result  ongoing lease operations at closed or under performing facilities could impair our results of operations 
we depend on a limited number of governmental customers for significant portion of our revenues 
we currently derive  and expect to continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from the bureau of prisons and various state agencies 
the loss of  or a significant decrease in  business from the bureau of prisons or those state agencies could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
the bureau of prisons accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended december  million and for the fiscal year ended december  million 
we expect to continue to depend upon the bureau of prisons and a relatively small group of other governmental customers for a significant percentage of our revenues 
we may continue to operate under unprofitable contracts at facilities that we own to offset expenses associated with ownership of the facility 
if we close a facility that we own  we will remain obligated for expenses associated with the facility 
if our operations are unprofitable at a leased facility or if the leased facility is performing significantly below targeted levels  we would typically terminate the contract and the lease 
however  we may continue to operate our contract at an owned facility to offset the expenses associated with ownership 
continued performance of such a contract could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
because our revenues can fluctuate from period to period  we may face short term funding shortfalls from time to time 
revenues can fluctuate from year to year due to changes in government funding policies  changes in the number of clients referred to our facilities by governmental agencies  the opening of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities and the termination of contracts for a facility or the closure of a facility 
our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter  based on the number of contracted days in each quarter 
because our revenues can vary  we may face short term funding shortfalls from time to time 
in addition  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
we are subject to significant insurance costs 
worker s compensation  employee health and general liability insurance represent significant costs to us 
we continue to incur increasing insurance costs due to adverse claims experience and rising healthcare costs in general 
due to concerns over corporate governance and recent corporate accounting scandals  liability and other types of insurance have become more difficult and costly to obtain 
in addition  as a result of the stockholder lawsuits brought within the last few years  our directors and officers liability insurance has increased 
unanticipated additional insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows  and the failure to obtain or maintain any necessary insurance coverage or the inability of an insurance carrier to perform under its obligations through issued coverage could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may be adversely affected by inflation 
many of our facility management contracts provide for fixed management fees or fees that increase by only small amounts during their term 
if  due to inflation or other causes  our operating expenses  such as wages and salaries of our employees  and insurance  medical and food costs  increase at rates faster than increases  if any  in our management fees  then our profitability would be adversely affected 
we are subject to risks associated with ownership of real estate 
our ownership of correctional and detention facilities subjects us to risks typically associated with investments in real estate  and in particular  correctional and detention facilities  are relatively illiquid and  therefore  our ability to divest ourselves of one or more of our facilities promptly in response to changed conditions is limited 
investments in correctional and detention facilities subject us to risks involving potential exposure to environmental liability and uninsured loss 
our operating costs may be affected by the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  as well as  the cost of complying with future legislation 
in addition  although we maintain insurance for many types of losses  there are certain types of losses  such as losses from earthquakes  riots and acts of terrorism  which may be either uninsurable or for which it may not be economically feasible to obtain insurance coverage 
as a result  we could lose both our capital invested in  and anticipated profits from  one or more of the facilities we own 
further  it is possible to experience losses that may exceed the limits of insurance coverage 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in interest rates 
we continually monitor exposure to market risk and develop appropriate strategies to manage this risk 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks  including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
in conjunction with the issuance of the senior notes  we entered into an interest rate swap of million related to the interest obligations under the senior notes in effect converting them to a floating rate based on six month libor 
interest rate exposure our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from our long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
the debt on our consolidated financial statements with fixed interest rates consist of the bonds issued by mcf in august in connection with the sale and leaseback transaction and approximately million of the senior notes not hedged by the interest rate swap 
at december   of our consolidated long term debt million of debt outstanding on the senior notes issued in june was subject to variable interest rates 
the detrimental effect of a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would be to reduce income before provision for income taxes by approximately million for the year ended december  at december   the fair value of our consolidated fixed rate debt approximated carrying value based upon discounted future cash flows using current market prices
