the company operating results in reflect a solid recovery in the manufacturing sector of the us economy from both a volume and material price standpoint 
the company s metals segment showed the most dramatic year over year changes in market dynamics 
total metal tons sold increased nearly versus last year and material prices rose on average compared to the corresponding twelve month period 
metal material price acceleration was in the high single digits during the first quarter of during the second quarter  prices continued to accelerate while demand across a wide cross section of our end use customer markets remained very strong 
by year end  metal material prices were approximately higher than the end of solid recoveries in both domestic and global markets have increased the demand for steel  leading to shortages in raw materials such as scrap  iron ore and coke 
these supply constraints served to fuel the acceleration of metal prices throughout the company s plastics segment also enjoyed double digit real growth 
in contrast to the steep price increases in steel  plastic material prices rose at a more moderate rate and largely did not take effect until the latter half of management estimates the plastics price increase to be approximately for the year 
most of the sales growth reported in the plastics segment was due to the planned geographic expansion of the segment into the southeast portion of the us  which the company embarked upon in the favorable market conditions of were in direct contrast to those the company experienced in recent years 
results from through most of reflect the impact of a prolonged downturn in the durable goods manufacturing sector of the economy that began in the second half of evidence of the market depression  along with the recovery  can be found in a review of the history of the purchaser s managers index pmi provided by the institute of supply managers see table directly below 
generally speaking  an index above indicates growth in the manufacturing sector of the us economy 
the following table shows what the average pmi has been for each quarter during those years 
table year qtr qtr qtr qtr the index shows declining activity to flat growth in the manufacturing sector of the economy since the third quarter of  that generally continued until the final quarter of in early  the index indicated some growth but it was not sustained 
in contrast  the index for every quarter of was greater than reflecting growth 
management initiatives key to the company s operating success in was management s restructuring of the company s cost base during the through economic downturn 
reacting to the lengthy market downturn during the past few years  management implemented a series of initiatives in its metals segment to increase operating margins and improve asset management 
as a result  over time  the company lowered its consolidated breakeven sales level by reducing operating expense in its metals segment while increasing worker productivity 
throughout  and  the company aggressively pursued permanent cost saving initiatives  which included exiting non strategic and or non performing business s units and flattening its overall organization  eliminating areas of redundant effort and related costs 
the combination of volume reductions  productivity improvements and cost savings reduced quarterly operating expenses as shown in table dollars in millions

table operating expense of sales year qtr qtr qtr qtr total excludes impairment charges to further illustrate  incremental operating expense for the company of million was of the million year over year sales increase 
the company was well poised to leverage its earnings potential during the economic recovery 
since  the company has also improved its inventory turnover and purposely sold unused facility space in select operations as part of its restructuring initiatives 
the cash generated from these actions  along with the sale of certain non performing business units in and strong operating results in  allowed the company to reduce its total debt and other financing arrangements including its accounts receivable securitization facility by million through the end of as illustrated in table dollars in millions 
table december  long term debt receivable securitization total financing arrangements increase decrease in summary  the company s performance was fueled in by a turnaround in overall market conditions  including an enhanced metal pricing environment 
management s cost and productivity initiatives during the recent difficult years positioned the company to take full advantage of the improved market dynamics in and generate substantial shareholder returns while continuing to de leverage the balance sheet 
current business outlook year end favorable pmi index is an indicator that demand for the company s products and services should continue at their current high levels in at least the short term 
additionally  the steady decline in the dollar could lead to an increase in us manufacturing goods exporting and likewise serve to hold down the rate of increase in imports of like products 
at the end of  raw material shortages used in the production of metal were still prevalent  thereby keeping prices for metal products at high levels 
as mentioned previously  some price inflation has started in plastic materials as well 
generally speaking  current business conditions are favorable 

table of contents risk factors as part of its current financing agreements with its various lenders  the company has specific principal payments required over the next few years as summarized below in table dollars in millions table and beyond required principal payments on debt in addition  the company s principal source of cash besides cash from operating results is its accounts receivable securitization agreement herein referred to as financing agreement  which expires in december it is management s intent to replace this facility with a revolving credit line or some similar type of debt financing during  but there can be no certainty of success 
despite the recent improved recovery within the manufacturing sector of the us economy  there can be no guarantee as to its magnitude or duration 
additionally  the company s ability to timely pass through supplier driven material cost increases to its customer base is also critical to meeting required debt service requirements and remaining in compliance with its debt covenants 
should the economic and market recovery turn out to be short term in length  management could pursue further options to ensure it generates enough cash to facilitate the required payments of principal as outlined in its agreements with its primary lenders 
these options could include  but not necessarily be limited to  further operating cost reductions and organizational restructuring  further working capital improvements  deferral of non critical capital projects  sale of assets or business units  refinancing of the company through additional equity or debt  or renegotiating existing long term loans outstanding 
management cannot guarantee that any of these options will be available if needed 
none of these options are under consideration at this time  other than the ongoing analysis and review of operating expense and levels of working capital required in the business and the aforementioned replacement of the expiring accounts receivable securitization financing 
all current business conditions lead management to believe it will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations and planned working capital improvements  to fund its ongoing capital expenditure program and to meet its debt obligations 
management also believes improved results stemming from current favorable business conditions has placed the company in a position to successfully refinance its financing agreement expiring in december results of operations year to year comparisons and commentary the following financial comparisons include certain significant changes in the company s structure or business that are considered to be important to the reader s general understanding when viewing results of operations for the years presented

in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred additional non recurring charges associated with equipment lease buyout provisions for assets included in the sale of a non strategic business unit and for the negotiated early property lease buyout and related write off of leasehold improvements of a vacated facility

critical accounting policies the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals  which necessarily include amounts that are based on estimates and assumptions 
the following is a description of some of the more significant valuation policies 
table of contents accounts receivable accounts receivable are evaluated on a quarterly basis and any significant customers with delinquent balances are reviewed to determine future collectibility 
assessments are based on legal issues bankruptcy status  past history  current financial and credit agency reports  and the experience of the credit representatives 
accounts judged to be uncollectible are reserved or written off in the quarter in which the determination is made 
additional reserves are maintained based on the company s historical bad debt experience 
inventory substantially all inventories are valued using the last in first out lifo method 
under this method  the current value of material sold is recorded as cost of material sold rather than the actual cost in the order in which it was purchased 
this means that older costs are included in inventory  which may be higher or lower than current costs 
this method of valuation is subject to year to year fluctuations in cost of material sold  which is influenced by the inflation or deflation existing within the metals or plastics industry 
the use of lifo for inventory valuation was chosen to better match replacement cost of inventory with the current pricing used to bill customers 
retirement plans the company values retirement plan assets and liabilities based on assumptions and valuations established by management following consultation with its independent actuary 
future valuations are subject to market changes  which are not in the control of the company and could differ materially from the amounts currently reported 
insurance plans the company is self insured for a portion of worker s compensation and automobile insurance 
self insurance amounts are capped for individual claims  and  in the aggregate  for each policy year by an insurance company 
self insurance reserves are based on unpaid  known claims including related administrative fees assessed by the insurance company for claims processing and a reserve for incurred but not reported claims based on the company s historical claim experience and development 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is largely recognized upon shipment  whereupon title passes and the company has no further obligations to the customer 
the company has entered into consignment inventory agreements with a few select customers whereby revenue is not recorded until the customer has consumed product from the consigned inventory and title has passed 
provisions for sales discounts and rebates to customers  and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded 
shipping and handling charges are recorded as operating expenses in the period incurred 
goodwill impairment the carrying value of goodwill is evaluated annually during the first quarter of each fiscal year or when certain events eg the potential sale of an entity occur which require a more current valuation 
the valuation is based on the comparison of an entity s discounted cash flow equity valuation to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the equity valuation the goodwill is impaired appropriately 
the equity valuation is based on historical data and management assumptions of future cash flow 
since the assumptions are forward looking  actual results could differ materially from those used in the valuation process 
income taxes income tax provisions are based on income reported for financial statement purposes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the company records valuation allowances or adjustments against its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the amounts will not be recognized 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for totalled million as compared to million in major expenditures included the replacement and upgrading of machinery and equipment  and enhancements to information processing systems 
it is anticipated that capital expenditures will be approximately million in  mainly in the area of customary repair and replacement of existing machinery and equipment and a planned increased investment in upgrading or replacing certain of the company s existing business systems 

table of contents capital expenditures for totalled million as compared to million in major expenditures included replacement of machinery and equipment  increased processing capabilities and enhancements to a warehouse management system 
during  the company sold and leased back approximately million of fixed assets respectively  which added to cash flow and minimized other financing requirements 
the leaseback transactions are recorded as operating leases and therefore are not reflected as debt on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operating results reflect significantly improved economic conditions within its primary customer markets 
in  management initiated several actions that served to generate cash  which in turn  reduced the company s debt load and restructured its base operating costs  better positioning itself to favorably leverage and future years incremental sales 
many of the actions initiated resulted in charges that were taken against earnings in the form of impairment or other special charges million recorded in 
additionally  in the last four years  the company aggressively lowered its investment in inventory and sold unused facility space in select operations 
the cash generated from these actions along with the previously mentioned sale of certain non performing business units  allowed the company to reduce its total debt and other financing arrangements including its financing agreement by million since the end of as well as fund its ongoing operations 
the company s principal internal sources of liquidity are earnings from operations and management of working capital 
additionally  the company utilizes an financing agreement see footnote for more details as its primary external funding source for working capital needs 
cash flow from operating activities in was a positive million 
this included a million increase in accounts receivable sold under the company s financing agreement due to additional funding requirements for operations 
excluding the impact of reduced receivables sold under the company s financing agreement  cash flow from operations was a positive million 
working capital  excluding the current portion of long term debt  of million is up million  or  since the start of average inventory levels declined mid year largely due to tightening metal supply and related extended mill delivery lead times 
during the fourth quarter  the company s supplier base was beginning to make progress on shortening delivery lead times  resulting in rising stock levels at year end 
the higher inventory levels at the end of will support the company s historically seasonally stronger first and second quarter sales activity in days sales in inventory dsi declined to days on average in from days one year ago 
gross trade receivables prior to the impact of receivables sold under the financing agreement increased million through december  largely due to higher material pricing and volume growth 
the days sales outstanding dso at year end were days  an improvement versus days in at december   million of receivables were sold or utilized under the financing agreement versus million at december  
available funds remaining under this facility were million at year end the company paid million in for tax payments pertaining primarily to estimated federal and state income tax obligations 
the company also paid million on interest or other debt related obligations due 
as of december   the company remains in compliance with the covenants of its financial agreements  which require it to maintain certain funded debt to capital ratios  working capital to debt ratios and a minimum equity value as defined within the agreement 
a summary of covenant compliance is shown below 
actual required debt to capital ratio working capital to debt ratio minimum equity value million million all current business conditions lead management to believe it will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations and planned working capital improvements principally from reduced inventories  to fund its ongoing capital expenditure programs and meet its debt obligations 

table of contents cash commitments the following is a schedule of cash commitments for long term debt and non cancelable lease payments payments due in debt leases total later years total item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various rate and metal price risks that arise in the normal course of business 
the company finances its operations with fixed and variable rate borrowings and the financing agreement 
market risk arises from changes in variable interest rates 
an increase of in interest rates on the variable rate indebtedness and financing agreement would increase the company s annual interest expense and discount on sale of accounts receivable by approximately million 
the company s raw material costs are comprised primarily of highly engineered metals and plastics 
market risk arises from changes in the price of steel  other metals and plastics 
although average selling prices generally increase or decrease as material costs increase or decrease  the impact of a change in the purchase price of materials is more immediately reflected in the company s cost of goods sold than in its selling prices 
commitments and contingencies the company is the defendant in several lawsuits arising out of the conduct of its business 
these lawsuits are incidental and occur in the normal course of the company s business affairs 
it is the opinion of the company s in house counsel  based on current knowledge  that no uninsured liability will result from the outcome of the litigation  that would have material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position to the company
