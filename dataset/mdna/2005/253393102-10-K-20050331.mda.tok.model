in july  the company had converted a cash based royalty arrangement with that provider into an equity investment in that company which resulted in this non cash investment 
interest expense  net interest expense decreased by million to million from million in primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average borrowings on the company s senior secured revolving credit facility 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for inventory  capital improvements  and pre opening expenses to support expansion plans  as well as for various investments in store remodeling  store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements 
the company s main sources of liquidity in have been our cash flows from operations  borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility  net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes  and proceeds from sale leaseback transactions

adjustments to net income depreciation expense increased million in due primarily to including galyan s operations from the acquisition date of july  to january  tax benefit from the exercise of stock options decreased by million 
as options granted under the company s stock plans are exercised  the company will continue to receive a tax deduction  however  the amounts and the timing cannot be predicted 
changes in assets and liabilities the primary factors contributing to the decrease in the change in assets and liabilities were the change in inventory along with a decrease in the change in accrued expenses  partially offset by a change in deferred revenue and other liabilities primarily due to an increase in construction allowances along with the change in accounts payable and income taxes payable 
the increase in the change in inventory was primarily due to an increase in in transit inventory compared to last year 
the decrease in the change in accrued expenses was primarily related to a decrease in galyan s accrued expenses from the acquisition date to the end of the year partially offset by an increase in accrued property and equipment 
the change in accounts payable was primarily due to an increase in the change in in transit inventory 
the change in income taxes payable was primarily related to the decrease in the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options and changes in deferred taxes 
the cash flows from operating the company s stores is a significant source of liquidity  and will continue to be used in primarily to purchase inventory  make capital improvements and open new stores

table of contents fiscal year ended january  january  new  relocated and remodeled stores future stores existing stores information systems administration and distribution during  we opened stores  relocated three stores  acquired galyan s stores  closed three dick s stores and closed three galyan s stores  resulting in an ending store count of stores in states 
two of the dick s store closures were not related to the galyan s acquisition 
one was closed as its replacement was opened in  and the second was closed due to poor performance 
sale leaseback transactions covering store fixtures  buildings and information technology assets also have the effect of returning to the company cash previously invested in these assets 
during  we completed four building sale leaseback transactions that generated proceeds of million  of which million of the capital expenditures were incurred in the increase in new  relocated and remodeled stores is primarily due to an increase in construction allowances and conversion of the galyan s stores to dick s stores 
the increase in information systems capital expenditures is primarily related to the implementation of the new merchandising system 
the increase in administration and distribution capital expenditures is primarily related to the new corporate headquarters that opened during june of and the conversion of the plainfield distribution center

at the conclusion of the construction period  the asset and related liability will be removed from the balance sheet in a manner similar to a sale leaseback transaction if certain conditions are met 
the application of issue has no impact to cash balances  net cash flow  the statement of operations or cash obligations 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities increased by million to million primarily reflecting the net proceeds from the senior convertible notes and the increase in the change in the balance under the revolving credit agreement

net proceeds to the company of million are after the net cost of a convertible bond hedge and a separate warrant transaction as well as million of transaction costs associated with the offering 
the bond hedge and warrant transactions effectively increase the conversion price associated with the senior convertible notes during the term of these transactions from to  or from to per share  thereby reducing the potential economic dilutive effect to shareholders upon conversion 
on july   dick s sporting goods paid million  net of cash acquired of million  to fund and consummate the galyan s tender offer and the acquisition  including the repayment of million of 
table of contents galyan s indebtedness 
the company obtained approximately million of these funds from cash and cash equivalents and investments and the balance from the borrowings under its credit agreement

on july   the company amended its credit agreement  among other matters  increasing it from million to million  including up to million in the form of letters of credit 
borrowing availability under the credit agreement is generally limited to the lesser of of the company s eligible inventory or of the company s inventory s liquidation value  in each case net of specified reserves and less any letters of credit outstanding 
interest on outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement currently accrues  at the company s option  at a rate based on either i the prime corporate lending rate or ii the libor rate plus to based on the level of total borrowings during the prior three months

as of january   the company was in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement 
cash requirements in  other than normal operating expenses  are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures related to the addition of new stores  enhanced information technology and improved distribution infrastructure 
the company plans to open at least new stores during the company also anticipates incurring additional expenditures for remodeling or relocating certain existing stores 
while there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized  the company expects net capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
the company believes that cash flows generated from operations and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements through fiscal other new business opportunities or store expansion rates substantially in excess of those presently planned may require additional funding 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s only off balance sheet contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  relate to operating lease obligations and letters of credit 
the company has excluded these items from the balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table summarizes the company s material contractual obligations  including both on and off balance sheet arrangements in effect at january   and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the company s liquidity and capital requirements in future periods

outlook galyan s conversion due to the galyan s acquisition  additional risk and uncertainties arise that could affect our financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results for fiscal and beyond to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements included in this report or otherwise made by our management 
these risks include those associated with combining businesses and achieving expected savings and synergies including annualized cost savings and merchandise buying improvements and or with assimilating acquired companies and the fact that merger integration and store closing costs related to the galyan s acquisition are difficult to predict with a level of certainty and may be greater than expected 
additionally  there are various risks and uncertainties attributable to galyan s  many of which cannot be predicted  which could have a material affect on our business or operations 
since the first part of february  we have completed the systems conversion and all of our stores are now on the same systems 
from merchandising to allocations to the point of sale to warehouse management  we have eliminated duplicate systems and are now operating on a common platform 
we have re signed all of the galyan s stores as dick s stores in order to leverage the advertising spending in the markets where both dick s and galyan s operate stores  and we have also reset the interior of the former galyan s stores to optimize the space for the dick s merchandise assortment 
the reassortment initiative is well under way and is being done in conjunction with the arrival of spring receipts 
as of the end of february  all administrative functions and processes were run solely out of the dick s corporate headquarters as the former galyan s headquarters building has been closed 
overall  our plan is on track to complete the conversion by the end of the second quarter of fiscal we will continue to modify the interior of the stores and effect changes to the merchandise assortment 
when this initiative is complete  we expect to be operating these stores not only under the dick s name  but also with the same merchandise assortments  financial discipline and customer service expectations as we have for the rest of our stores 

table of contents the company anticipates closing ten stores in conjunction with the conversion  six dick s stores and four galyan s stores  the galyan s clearance center and the galyan s corporate headquarters 
the company also expects total merger integration and store closing costs of approximately million pre tax  of which million was incurred in fiscal the company estimates future merger costs of million in fiscal with the balance in fiscal and beyond  which relates to future lease payments on closed stores 
merger integration and store closing costs primarily include the expense of closing dick s stores  advertising the re branding of galyan s stores  duplicative costs  recruiting and system conversion costs 
newly issued accounting standards as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not recognize any expense for stock option grants or for our employee stock purchase plan 
the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  which requires expense recognition as compensation costs in our consolidated statements of income for stock option grants and certain employee stock purchase plans beginning in the third quarter of our fiscal the company is currently analyzing the impact of expensing stock options  which is based on a number of factors  including the company s stock price  and will not be determined until the end of the second quarter of fiscal based on current information however  the company estimates the expense related to stock options and the employee stock purchase plan in the second half of the year to be approximately per share 
at its meeting on july  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a tentative consensus that the dilutive effect of contingent convertible debt instruments must be included in dilutive eps regardless of whether the triggering contingency has been satisfied 
this tentative consensus  eitf issue issue  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  would be applied on a retroactive basis and would require restatement of prior period diluted eps by those affected companies 
at its september meeting  the eitf affirmed its tentative consensus as it relates to market price contingencies 
as described in part ii  item submission of matters to a vote of security holders  the indenture prohibited the company from paying cash upon a conversion of the notes if an event of default as defined in the indenture had occurred and was continuing at that time 
the company sought the consent of the holders of the notes to amend the indenture to eliminate that prohibition 
this default provision  as it existed  would have caused the company to include all shares of its common stock which are potentially issuable upon a conversion of the notes in its computation of diluted earnings per share despite the company s obligations and intention to settle amounts due in cash 
the company successfully completed its consent solicitation on december  and the supplemental indenture removed the restriction that prohibited the company from paying cash upon the conversion of any note if there had occurred and was continuing an event of default under the indenture 
as a result of the supplemental indenture  the company is still permitted to exclude shares of its common stock which are potentially issuable upon a conversion of the notes in its computation of diluted earnings per share 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
critical accounting policies are those that the company believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require the company s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation the company values inventory using the lower of weighted average cost or market method 
market price is generally based on the current selling price of the merchandise 
the company regularly reviews inventories to determine if the carrying value of the inventory exceeds market value and the company records a reserve to reduce the carrying value to its market price  as necessary 
historically  the company has rarely experienced significant 
table of contents occurrences of obsolescence or slow moving inventory 
however  future changes such as customer merchandise preference  unseasonable weather patterns  or business trends could cause the company s inventory to be exposed to obsolescence or slow moving merchandise 
shrink expense is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical shrink trends 
the company performs physical inventories at the stores and distribution centers throughout the year 
the reserve for shrink represents an estimate for shrink for each of the company s locations since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date 
estimates by location and in the aggregate are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary significantly from actual results 
vendor allowances vendor allowances include allowances  rebates and cooperative advertising funds received from vendors 
these funds are determined for each fiscal year and the majority are based on various quantitative contract terms 
amounts expected to be received from vendors relating to the purchase of merchandise inventories are recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold as the merchandise is sold 
amounts that represent a reimbursement of costs incurred  such as advertising  are recorded as a reduction to the related expense in the period that the related expense is incurred 
the company records an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest projected purchase volumes and advertising forecasts 
on an annual basis at the end of the year  the company confirms earned allowances with vendors to ensure the amounts are recorded in accordance with the terms of the contract 
goodwill  intangible assets and impairment of long lived assets goodwill and other intangible assets must be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
our evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires accounting judgments and financial estimates in determining the fair value of such assets 
if these judgments or estimates change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the company reviews long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified  which is the store level 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by the company with respect to future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
business combinations our acquisition of galyan s is accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the assets and liabilities of galyan s are adjusted to their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the purchase price allocation as of january  is preliminary 
the determination of fair values involves the use of estimates and assumptions  which may differ from actual results in the future 
while we believe the factors considered and the independent appraisal performed will provide a reasonable basis for determining fair value  we cannot guarantee that the estimates and assumptions used will prevent adjustments to those estimates in future periods 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain losses related to health  workers compensation and general liability insurance  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our liability exposure 
liabilities associated with these losses are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  industry factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
risks and uncertainties intense competition in the sporting goods industry could limit our growth and reduce our profitability 
the market for sporting goods retailers is highly fragmented and intensely competitive 
our current and prospective competitors include many large companies that have substantially greater market presence  name 
table of contents recognition  and financial  marketing and other resources than us 
we compete directly or indirectly with the following categories of companies large format sporting goods stores  traditional sporting goods stores and chains  specialty sporting goods shops and pro shops  mass merchandisers  warehouse clubs  discount stores and department stores  and catalog and internet based retailers 
pressure from our competitors could require us to reduce our prices or increase our spending for advertising and promotion 
increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of innovative store formats  aggressive pricing strategies and retail sale methods  such as the internet  could cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
lack of available retail store sites on terms acceptable to us  rising real estate prices and other costs and risks relating to new store openings could severely limit our growth opportunities 
our strategy includes opening stores in new and existing markets 
we must successfully choose store sites  execute favorable real estate transactions on terms that are acceptable to us  hire competent personnel and effectively open and operate these new stores 
our plans to increase the number of our retail stores will depend in part on the availability of existing retail stores or store sites 
we cannot assure you that stores or sites will be available to us  or that they will be available on terms acceptable to us 
if additional retail store sites are unavailable on acceptable terms  we may not be able to carry out a significant part of our growth strategy 
rising real estate costs and acquisition  construction and development costs could also inhibit our ability to grow 
if we fail to locate desirable sites  obtain lease rights to these sites on terms acceptable to us  hire adequate personnel and open and effectively operate these new stores  our financial performance could be adversely affected 
in addition  our expansion in new and existing markets may present competitive  distribution and merchandising challenges that differ from our current challenges  including competition among our stores  diminished novelty of our store design and concept  added strain on our distribution center  additional information to be processed by our management information systems and diversion of management attention from operations  such as the control of inventory levels in our existing stores  to the opening of new stores and markets 
new stores in new markets  where we are less familiar with the target customer and less well known  may face different or additional risks and increased costs compared to stores operated in existing markets  or new stores in existing markets 
expansion into new markets could also bring us into direct competition with retailers with whom we have no past experience as direct competitors 
to the extent that we become increasingly reliant on entry into new markets in order to grow  we may face additional risks and our net income could suffer 
to the extent that we are not able to meet these new challenges  our sales could decrease and our operating costs could increase 
there also can be no assurance that our new stores will generate sales levels necessary to achieve store level profitability or profitability comparable to that of existing stores 
new stores also may face greater competition and have lower anticipated sales volumes relative to previously opened stores during their comparable years of operation 
we may not be able to advertise cost effectively in new or smaller markets in which we have less store density  which could slow sales growth at such stores 
we also cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain and distribute adequate product supplies to our stores or maintain adequate warehousing and distribution capability at acceptable costs 
if we are unable to predict or react to changes in consumer demand  we may lose customers and our sales may decline 
our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods 
our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change 
we often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors several months in advance of the proposed delivery 
if we misjudge the market for our merchandise our sales may decline significantly 
we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take 
table of contents significant inventory markdowns or miss opportunities for other products  both of which could have a negative impact on our profitability 
conversely  shortages of items that prove popular could reduce our net sales 
in addition  a major shift in consumer demand away from sporting goods or sport apparel could also have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be subject to product liability claims and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims 
we may be subject to lawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment that we sell 
in addition  although we do not sell hand guns  assault weapons or automatic firearms  we do sell hunting rifles which are products that are associated with an increased risk of injury and related lawsuits 
we may also be subject to lawsuits relating to the design  manufacture or distribution of our private label products 
we may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense of these claims 
we may also incur losses due to lawsuits relating to our performance of background checks on hunting rifle purchasers as mandated by state and federal law or the improper use of hunting rifles sold by us  including lawsuits by municipalities or other organizations attempting to recover costs from hunting rifle manufacturers and retailers relating to the misuse of hunting rifles 
in addition  in the future there may be increased federal  state or local regulation  including taxation  of the sale of hunting rifles in our current markets as well as future markets in which we may operate 
commencement of these lawsuits against us or the establishment of new regulations could reduce our sales and decrease our profitability 
there is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed our insurance coverage 
in addition  we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future 
although we have entered into product liability indemnity agreements with many of our vendors  we cannot assure you that we will be able to collect payments sufficient to offset product liability losses or in the case of our private label products  collect anything at all 
in addition  we are subject to regulation by the consumer product safety commission and similar state regulatory agencies 
if we fail to comply with government and industry safety standards  we may be subject to claims  lawsuits  fines and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our suppliers  distributors or manufacturers do not provide us with sufficient quantities of products  our sales and profitability will suffer 
we purchase merchandise from nearly  vendors 
in fiscal  purchases from nike represented approximately of our merchandise purchases 
although in fiscal  purchases from no other vendor represented more than of our total purchases  our dependence on our principal suppliers involves risk 
if there is a disruption in supply from a principal supplier or distributor  we may be unable to obtain the merchandise that we desire to sell and that consumers desire to purchase 
moreover  many of our suppliers provide us with incentives  such as return privileges  volume purchasing allowances and cooperative advertising 
a decline or discontinuation of these incentives could reduce our profits 
we believe that a significant portion of the products that we purchase  including those purchased from domestic suppliers  is manufactured abroad in countries such as china  taiwan and south korea 
in addition  we believe most  if not all  of our private label merchandise is manufactured abroad 
foreign imports subject us to the risks of changes in import duties  quotas  loss of most favored nation or mfn status with the united states for a particular foreign country  work stoppages  delays in shipment  freight cost increases and economic uncertainties including the united states imposing antidumping or countervailing duty orders  safeguards  remedies or compensation and retaliation due to illegal foreign trade practices 
if any of these or other factors were to cause a disruption of trade from the countries in which the suppliers of our vendors are located  our inventory levels may be reduced or the cost of our products may increase 
in addition  to the extent that any foreign manufacturers from whom we purchase products directly or indirectly utilize labor and other practices that vary from those commonly accepted in the united states  we could be hurt by any resulting negative publicity or  in come cases  face potential liability 
to date  we have not experienced any difficulties of this nature 
historically  instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which our vendors or we obtain our products has not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
however  we cannot predict the effect that future changes in economic or political conditions in such foreign countries may have on our operations 
in the event of disruptions or delays in supply due to economic or political conditions in foreign countries  such disruptions or delays could adversely affect our results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made 
in addition  merchandise purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the merchandise we currently purchase abroad 

table of contents countries from which our vendors obtain these new products may  from time to time  impose new or adjust prevailing quotas or other restrictions on exported products  and the united states may impose new duties  quotas and other restrictions on imported products 
the united states congress periodically considers other restrictions on the importation of products obtained by our vendors and us 
the cost of such products may increase for us if applicable duties are raised  or import quotas with respect to such products are imposed or made more restrictive 
problems with our new information system software could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations 
we implemented a new information system including a suite of applications that includes jda merchandising and arthur allocation 
the phased implementation began during the third fiscal quarter of and was completed during fiscal this new system  if not functioning properly  could disrupt our ability to track  record and analyze the merchandise that we sell and cause disruptions of operations  including  among others  an inability to process shipments of goods  process financial information or credit card transactions  deliver products or engage in similar normal business activities  particularly if there are any unforeseen interruptions after implementation 
although we believe that we have taken and will continue to take prudent measures in planning  testing and transitioning to the new system  any material disruption  malfunctions or other similar problems in or with the new system could negatively impact our financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations 
we rely on two distribution centers along with a smaller return facility  and if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at one of these facilities  we may lose merchandise and be unable to effectively deliver it to our stores 
we expanded our distribution center in smithton  pennsylvania from  to  square feet in the fourth quarter of  and operate a  square foot distribution center in plainfield  indiana 
we also operate a  square foot return center in conklin  new york 
any natural disaster or other serious disruption to one of these facilities due to fire  tornado or any other cause would damage a significant portion of our inventory  could impair our ability to adequately stock our stores and process returns of products to vendors and could negatively affect our sales and profitability 
our growth could cause us to seek alternative facilities 
such expansion of the current facility or alternatives could affect us in ways we cannot predict 
our business is seasonal and our annual results are highly dependent on the success of our fourth quarter sales 
our business is highly seasonal in nature 
our highest sales and operating income historically occur during the fourth fiscal quarter  which is due  in part  to the holiday selling season and  in part  to our strong sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel 
the fourth quarter generated approximately of our net sales and approximately of our net income for fiscal any decrease in our fourth quarter sales  whether because of a slow holiday selling season  unseasonable weather conditions  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year 
our business is dependent on the general economic conditions in our markets 
in general  our sales depend on discretionary spending by our customers 
a deterioration of current economic conditions or an economic downturn in any of our major markets or in general could result in declines in sales and impair our growth 
general economic conditions and other factors that affect discretionary spending in the regions in which we operate are beyond our control and are affected by interest rates and inflation  the impact of an economic recession  the impact of natural disasters  consumer credit availability  consumer debt levels  consumer confidence in the economy  
table of contents tax rates and tax policy  unemployment trends  and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
increasing volatility in financial markets may cause some of the above factors to change with an even greater degree of frequency and magnitude 
because our stores are concentrated in the eastern half of the united states  we are subject to regional risks 
many of our stores are located primarily in the eastern half of the united states 
because of this  we are subject to regional risks  such as the regional economy  weather conditions  increasing costs of electricity  oil and natural gas  natural disasters  as well as government regulations specific to the states in which we operate 
if the region were to suffer an economic downturn or other adverse regional event  our net sales and profitability could suffer 
our results of operations may be harmed by unseasonably warm winter weather conditions 
many of our stores are located in geographic areas that experience seasonably cold weather 
we sell a significant amount of winter merchandise 
abnormally warm weather conditions could reduce our sales of these items and hurt our profitability 
additionally  abnormally wet or cold weather in the spring or summer months could reduce our sales of golf or other merchandise and hurt our profitability 
the terms of our senior secured revolving credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us  which may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions 
this impairment could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
our current senior secured revolving credit facility contains provisions which restrict our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  issue additional shares of capital stock in certain circumstances  make particular types of investments  incur liens  pay dividends  redeem capital stock  consummate mergers and consolidations  enter into transactions with affiliates or make substantial asset sales 
in addition  our obligations under the senior secured revolving credit facility are secured by interests in substantially all of our personal property excluding store and distribution center equipment and fixtures 
in the event of our insolvency  liquidation  dissolution or reorganization  the lenders under our senior secured revolving credit facility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions  if any  were made to our stockholders 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future  we may have to refinance all or a portion of our debt and or obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms could be obtained or that we will be able to operate at a profit 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
we may from time to time acquire complementary companies or businesses 
acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies  and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management s attention from other business issues and opportunities 
we may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire  including their personnel  financial systems  distribution  operations and general store operating procedures 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions  our business could suffer 
in addition  the integration of any acquired business  and their financial results  into ours may adversely affect our operating results 
we currently do not have any agreements with respect to any such acquisitions 
our ability to expand our business will be dependent upon the availability of adequate capital 
the rate of our expansion will also depend on the availability of adequate capital  which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt capital 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms or at all 
our current senior secured revolving credit facility contains provisions which restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to raise capital through the issuance of equity or make substantial asset sales which might otherwise be used to finance our expansion 
our obligations under the senior secured revolving credit facility are secured by interests in substantially all of our personal property excluding store and distribution center equipment and fixtures  which may further limit 
table of contents our access to certain capital markets or lending sources 
moreover  the actual availability under our credit facility is limited to the lesser of of our eligible inventory or of our inventory s liquidation value  in each case net of specified reserves and less any letters of credit outstanding  and opportunities for increased cash flows from reduced inventories would be partially offset by reduced availability through our senior secured revolving credit facility 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will be able to finance our current plans for the opening of new retail stores 
the loss of our key executives  especially edward w 
stack  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  could have a material adverse effect on our business due to the loss of their experience and industry relationships 
our success depends on the continued services of our senior management  particularly edward w 
stack  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
if we were to lose any key senior executive  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our business depends on our ability to meet our labor needs 
our success depends on hiring and retaining quality managers and sales associates in our stores 
we plan to expand our employee base to manage our anticipated growth 
competition for personnel  particularly for employees with retail expertise  is intense 
additionally  our ability to maintain consistency in the quality of customer service in our stores is critical to our success 
also  many of our store level employees are in entry level or part time positions that historically have high rates of turnover 
we are also dependent on the employees who staff our distribution and return centers  many of whom are skilled 
we may be unable to meet our labor needs and control our costs due to external factors such as unemployment levels  minimum wage legislation and wage inflation 
although none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements  we cannot guarantee that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future 
if we are unable to hire and retain sales associates capable of providing a high level of customer service  our business could be materially adversely affected 
terrorist attacks or acts of war may seriously harm our business 
among the chief uncertainties facing our nation and world  and as a result our business is the instability and conflict in the middle east 
obviously  no one can predict with certainty what the overall economic impact will be as a result of this 
clearly  events or series of events in the middle east or elsewhere could have a very serious adverse impact on our business 
terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to our company  our employees  our facilities and our customers  which could significantly impact our net sales  costs and expenses  and financial condition 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause our business to suffer in ways that we currently cannot predict 
our geographic focus in the eastern united states may make us more vulnerable to such uncertainties than other comparable retailers who may not have a similar geographic focus 
we are controlled by our chief executive officer and his relatives  whose interests may differ from other stockholders 
we have two classes of common stock 
the common stock has one vote per share and the class b common stock has votes per share 
as of january   mr 
edward w 
stack  our chairman and chief executive officer  and his relatives controlled approximately of the combined voting power of our common stock and class b common stock and would control the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the stockholders for approval  including mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
mr 
stack and his relatives may also acquire additional shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
they will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control 
the interests of mr 
stack and his relatives may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and they may take actions with which you disagree 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate substantially  which may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock 
our net sales and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the 
table of contents future 
these fluctuations may adversely affect our business  financial condition and the market price of our common stock 
a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  may cause variations in our quarterly net sales and operating results  including changes in demand for the products that we offer in our stores  lockouts or strikes involving professional sports teams  retirement of sports superstars used in marketing various products  costs related to the closures of existing stores  litigation  pricing and other actions taken by our competitors  adverse weather conditions in our markets  and general economic conditions 
our comparable store sales will fluctuate and may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance 
changes in our comparable store sales results could affect the price of our common stock 
a number of factors have historically affected  and will continue to affect  our comparable store sales results  including competition  our new store openings  general regional and national economic conditions  actions taken by our competitors  consumer trends and preferences  changes in the other tenants in the shopping centers in which we are located  new product introductions and changes in our product mix  timing and effectiveness of promotional events  lack of new product introductions to spur growth in the sale of various kinds of sports equipment  and weather 
we cannot assure you that comparable store sales will continue to increase at the rates achieved in our last fiscal year 
moreover  our comparable store sales may decline 
our comparable store sales may vary from quarter to quarter  and an unanticipated decline in revenues or comparable store sales may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general has been highly volatile 
factors that could cause fluctuation in the stock price may include  among other things actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts estimates or expectations  conditions or trends in our industry  changes in the market valuations of other retail companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  divestitures  joint ventures or other strategic initiatives  capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of common stock 

table of contents many of these factors are beyond our control 
these factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline  regardless of our operating performance 
our anti takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of our company  even if such change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could discourage  delay or prevent a merger  acquisition or other change in control of our company  even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of class b common stock  classifying the board of directors such that only one third of directors are elected each year  authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  prohibiting the use of cumulative voting for the election of directors  limiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  if our class b common stock is no longer outstanding  prohibiting stockholder action by partial written consent and requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders or by unanimous written consent  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  the delaware general corporation law  to which we are subject  prohibits  except under specified circumstances  us from engaging in any mergers  significant sales of stock or assets or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own at least of our common stock 
we may not have the ability to purchase convertible notes at the option of the holders or upon a change in control or to raise the funds necessary to finance the purchases 
on february   the company completed a private offering of million issue price of senior unsecured convertible notes in transactions pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
on february   february  and february   holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase their convertible notes 
however  it is possible that we would not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required purchase of convertible notes or would otherwise be prohibited under our senior secured revolving credit facility or other future debt instruments from making such payments in cash 
we may only pay the purchase price in cash and not in shares of our common stock 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain specific kinds of change in control events  holders may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their convertible notes 
however  it is possible that  upon a change in control  we may not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required purchase of convertible notes  and we may be unable to raise the funds necessary 
in addition  the issuance of our shares upon a conversion of convertible notes could result in a default under our senior secured revolving credit facility to the extent that the issuance creates a change of control event under our credit facility 
such a default under the senior secured credit facility could in turn create a cross default under the convertible notes 
the terms of our senior secured revolving credit facility and of any future indebtedness we incur may also restrict our ability to fund the purchase of convertible notes upon a change in control or if we are otherwise required to purchase convertible notes at the option of the holder 
if such restrictions exist  we would have to seek the consent of the lenders or repay those borrowings 
if we were unable to obtain the necessary consent or unable to repay those borrowings  we would be unable to purchase the convertible notes and  as a result  would be in default under the convertible notes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s net exposure to interest rate risk will consist primarily of borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility 
the company s senior secured revolving credit facility bears interest at rates that are benchmarked either to us short term floating rate interest rates or one month libor rates  at the company s election 
outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement were million as of january  there were no borrowings outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility as of january  the 
table of contents impact on the company s annual net income of a hypothetical one percentage point interest rate change on the average outstanding balances under the senior secured revolving credit facility would be approximately million based upon fiscal average borrowings 
credit risk in february  the company sold million issue price of senior unsecured convertible notes due convertible notes 
in conjunction with the issuance of these convertible notes  we also entered into a five year convertible bond hedge and a five year separate warrant transaction with one of the initial purchasers the counterparty and or certain of its affiliates 
subject to the movement in our common stock price  we could be exposed to credit risk arising out of net settlement of the convertible bond hedge and separate warrant transaction in our favor 
based on our review of the possible net settlements and the credit strength of the counterparty and its affiliates  we believe that we do not have a material exposure to credit risk as a result of these share option transactions 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance  however  that operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
tax matters presently  the company does not believe that there are any tax matters that could materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
significant portions of the company s net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the company s fiscal year  which is due  in part  to the holiday selling season and  in part  to our sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel 
any decrease in fiscal fourth quarter sales  whether because of a slow holiday selling season  unseasonable weather conditions  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year
