actual results may vary from those contained in such forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to uncollectible receivables  inventory valuation  goodwill  income taxes  deferred compensation and retirement plans  restructuring costs and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical performance and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  valuation allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred tax assets valuation allowance  inventory valuation  and goodwill impairment 
revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from the sale of it solutions and image processing software  third party products  network management and storage systems integration services and high performance cluster computer systems 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  cspi recognizes revenue as follows systems revenue revenue from the sale of hardware products is recognized at the time of shipment and when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in limited circumstances  we are engaged in long term contracts to design  develop  manufacture or modify complex equipment 
for these contracts  we may recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  measuring progress toward completion based on contract cost incurred to date as compared with total estimated contract costs 
the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs  including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the contract  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  anticipated increases in wages and prices for subcontractor services and materials  and the availability of subcontractor services and materials 
our estimates are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers  program managers and other personnel who review each long term contract monthly to assess the contract s schedule  performance  technical matters and estimated cost at completion 
when adjustments in estimated contract costs are determined  such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 
anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which determined

table of contents valuation allowances we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance for the entire balance of deferred tax assets in the us and us as it is more likely than not they will not be realized due to our being in a cumulative loss position 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and projected taxable income in making this assessment 
based on the lack of income in the us and us over the several years and lack of significant orders  we established a valuation allowance for the entire deferred tax asset 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for the future taxable income over the period in which the deferred taxes will reverse or nols expire  management believes it is more likely than not  that the company will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we consider and rely upon projections of future income 
the key assumptions in our projections include sales growth rates  including potential contract wins  and expected levels of operating expenditures in addition to factors discussed in the section factors that may affect future performance 
these assumptions are subject to variation based upon both internal and external factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
to the extent that actual experience deviates from our assumptions  our projections would be affected and hence our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax asset may change 
if the company is awarded a significant contract the company projections will be impacted and the company may reverse the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
inventory valuation the recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventories held  forecasted demand  pricing  competition and changes in technology 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write down may be required 
goodwill impairment we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on october  this standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and instead  be tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important that could indicate impairment include significant under performance relative to prior operating results  change in projections  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
at september  and we had  in goodwill compared to  in september  we had no impairment charge during the year ended september   but we did have an impairment charge of  recorded during the year ended september  in evaluating the impairment of goodwill  we consider a number of analyses such as discounted cash flow projections and market capitalization value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating fair value of the businesses with goodwill for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in addition  we make certain judgments about assets such as accounts receivable and inventory to the 
table of contents estimated balance sheet for those businesses 
we also consider our market capitalization adjusted for unallocated monetary assets such as cash  marketable debt securities and debt on the date we perform the analysis 
our key assumptions include sales growth and expected levels of operating expenditures  which are subject to variation based on both internal and external factors 
to the extent that actual experience deviates from the projections  our assessment regarding impairment may change 
such a change could have a material adverse affect on the statement of operations 
pension and retirement plans in the united kingdom and germany  the company provides defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for the majority of the employees 
in the us  the company also provides benefits through supplementary retirement plans to employees

the plan assumptions in the us include a discount rate of and the plan assumptions in the uk and germany include a discount rate of 
in addition  in the us  the company provides for officer death benefits through the post retirement plans to certain officers 
in calculation of the deferred compensation and retirement plans net liabilities  the company makes assumptions regarding expected discount rates  rates of return on assets and compensation increase rates 
if activities differ from the assumptions  deferred compensation and retirement plans net liabilities may require significant adjustments 
the company funds the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws and local tax laws 
liabilities for amounts in excess of these funding levels are accrued and reported in the consolidated balance sheet
