overview the gander mountain brand name has a long heritage and strong appeal to outdoor lifestyle customers given the brand s year history as a nationwide catalog operation from to  which by was augmented with retail stores 
in and  holiday companies  which at the time owned and operated a group of retail sporting goods stores  acquired these gander mountain retail stores  formed our company and began to build a new outdoor lifestyle business 
we have expanded our store base from stores in to gander mountain stores in states as of january  we have built our business by offering our customers a broad and deep assortment of national  regional and owned brand hunting  fishing and camping equipment  accessories and related technical apparel and footwear at low prices  accompanied by knowledgeable customer service 
our success will depend on our ability to grow our business by building new stores and by increasing sales in our existing stores 
we have embarked on a series of strategic and operating initiatives aimed at improving our merchandise offerings  enhancing profitability and accelerating new store openings 
we are transforming our market position from a traditional specialty store to a larger format  category focused store by opening larger format stores and increasing the selling space within our existing stores 
the larger format strategy has allowed us to offer our customers a broader and deeper assortment of merchandise 
we measure performance using such key operating statistics as comparable store sales  sales per square foot  gross margin percentage and store operating expenses  with a focus on labor  as a percentage of sales 
these results translate into store operating contribution  which we use to evaluate overall performance on an individual store basis 
store operating contribution is calculated by deducting a store s operating expenses from its gross margin 
in addition  general and administrative expenses are monitored in absolute amounts  as well as on a percentage of sales basis 
pre opening expenses are analyzed based on the number of store openings  market attributes and store size 
we also measure and evaluate investments in our retail locations  including inventory and property and equipment 
inventory performance is primarily measured by inventory turns  or the number of times store inventory turns over in a given period  and amounts of owned inventory at various times based on payment terms from our vendors 
the most significant investments in property and equipment are made at the time a store is opened by us 
we believe that the overall growth of our business will allow us to generally maintain or increase our gross margins 
increased merchandise volumes enable us to improve our purchasing leverage and achieve greater support throughout the supply chain 
the mix of merchandise in our total sales also influences our gross margins 
as we continue sales and store growth  a number of other factors may impact  positively or negatively  our gross margin percentage  including the introduction of new product categories with varying gross margin percentage characteristics  changes in the merchandise mix at our current locations  differences in merchandise mix by geographic location  price competition and sourcing of products from locations outside the united states 
the most significant store operating expenses are labor and related employee benefits and advertising 
we believe the combination of increased sales volume and improved labor management within our stores will allow us to better leverage payroll expenses over time 
our employee benefits include health insurance  the cost of which continues to increase faster than the general rate of inflation 
we continually monitor this cost and review strategies to effectively control increases  but we are subject to the overall trend of increases in health care costs 
advertising costs are monitored as a percentage of sales 
these costs are largely variable  which allows us to actively manage them to facilitate achieving our sales  gross margin percentage and store operating contribution objectives 
store operating contribution is measured as a percentage of sales 
it gives us an overall measure as to whether or not individual locations and markets are meeting our financial objectives 
general and administrative expenses are monitored and controlled as a percentage of sales 
in anticipation of our accelerated growth plans  we have made significant investments in infrastructure  including our information systems  distribution capabilities and management 
our current infrastructure facilitates the opening of stores at an accelerated rate  which we believe enables us to leverage our expenses 
accordingly  we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of sales over time 
pre opening expenses will continue to be related to store openings  including relocations 
these expenses will fluctuate based on the number and timing of new store openings 
inventory turns are based on cost of sales and average inventory for the applicable period 
we recognize that our inventory turns may be lower than those of other retailers  which we believe is due to the categories of merchandise we carry  including firearms  and the large quantities of merchandise we use in our in store displays 
we believe we have the opportunity to enhance our supply chain to improve our inventory turns 
additionally  in merchandise categories that experience slower inventory turns  we continue to work with vendors to increase our trade credit terms to reduce our investment in owned inventory 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve our inventory turns or inventory investment 
identification of appropriate new store sites is essential to our growth strategy 
we believe our focus on our larger store size and our flexible real estate strategy provides us with increased opportunities to find optimal real estate locations on attractive terms 
we evaluate and invest in new stores based on site specific projected returns on investment 
restatement of financial statements during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed a comprehensive review of our lease accounting practices 
as a result  we restated our financial statements for periods prior to fiscal and for the first three quarters of fiscal included in this report 
the restatements arise from revisions to accounting for i the amortization lives for leasehold improvements  ii construction allowances from landlords and iii certain pre opening period rent holidays 
the restatement adjustments were non cash and had no impact on revenues or net cash flows 
we did not amend our reports that were previously filed with the sec containing financial statements for the restatement 
historically  we have amortized leasehold improvements and construction allowances for our leased buildings over a period that included both the initial lease term and certain renewal option periods 
we recorded rent expense on a straight line basis over the initial lease term beginning with the commencement date of the lease 
we have now determined to use the initial lease term when amortizing leasehold improvements and to use a time period for our rent expense and construction allowances amortization beginning on the earlier of the commencement date of the lease or the date when we take possession of the building for construction of leaseholds or the initial setup of fixtures and merchandise 
however  in those circumstances where the commencement date of the lease term begins when we take possession of the leased space for construction purposes  the rent expense  net of construction allowances amortization  from that commencement date through the date we begin the initial setup of fixtures and merchandise is capitalized 
the net rent expense related to the period for the initial setup of fixtures and merchandise will be reflected in pre opening expense in our statements of operations 
in addition  financial accounting standards board technical bulletin  issues relating to accounting for leases  requires construction allowances to be classified as deferred rent liabilities and no longer recorded as reductions of leasehold improvements 
as a result  charges will reduce rent expense rather than amortization expense 
the cumulative effect of these adjustments on our statements of operations for fiscal through fiscal was an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million  a reduction in loss on disposal of assets of million and an increase in rent expense of million 
the cumulative effect of these adjustments on the balance sheet as of february  was an increase in deferred rent liability of million and a reduction in property and equipment of million 
as a result  retained earnings at february  decreased by million  as reflected in our statements of shareholders equity 
the effect of these adjustments for fiscal and fiscal on our statements of operations are decreases to net income of million or per share  and  or per share  respectively 
the following table shows the impact of these adjustments for fiscal and fiscal in thousands  except per share data fiscal fiscal as previously reported adjustments as restated as previously reported adjustments as restated balance sheet data property and equipment  net accrued and other current liabilities long term liabilities accumulated deficit total shareholders equity statement of operations data cost of goods sold store operating expenses general and administrative expenses pre opening expenses income loss from operations net income loss loss applicable to common shareholders basic and diluted loss applicable to common shareholders per share statement of cash flows data net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net increase in cash results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  selected items in the statements of operations as a percentage of our sales fiscal year ended february  restated january  restated january  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses store operating expenses general and administrative expenses pre opening expenses operating income loss interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax provision net income loss our fiscal year is a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to the end of january 
fiscal  and included weeks 
sales consist of sales from comparable stores  new stores and non comparable stores 
a store is included in the comparable store base in its fifteenth full month of operations 
a relocated store returns to the comparable store base in its fifteenth full month after relocation 
new store sales include sales from stores we opened during the current period 
non comparable store sales include sales in the current period from our stores opened during the previous fiscal year before they have begun their fifteenth month of operation 
during the quarter ended july   we changed this internal measurement from the fourteenth month to the fifteenth month to better reflect comparable sales activity in the stores and minimize the effect of grand opening activities 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of merchandise  freight  distribution  inventory shrinkage and store occupancy costs 
store occupancy costs include rent  real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges 
store operating expenses include store associate payroll  taxes and fringe benefits  advertising  maintenance  utilities  depreciation  insurance  bank and credit card charges and other store level expenses 
general and administrative expenses include all expenses associated with operating our corporate headquarters 
pre opening expenses consist primarily of payroll  rent  recruiting  advertising and other costs incurred prior to a new store opening 
fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  sales 
sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase primarily resulted from sales of million from fiscal and new stores not yet included in the comparable store sales base  offset in part by a comparable store sales decrease of million  or  and a million sales decrease from closed stores 
in fiscal  we opened new stores  including two relocated stores  and added million square feet of retail selling space  a increase 
overall  sales performance throughout the year was impacted by unfavorable weather conditions  which particularly affected our apparel footwear  fishing marine and camping categories 
the most significant impact on our business was in the third and fourth quarters  which were negatively impacted by long periods of unseasonably warm weather in our primary regions 
in addition  for certain of our stores  sales were also negatively impacted by cannibalization from some of the new gander mountain store openings as well as new competition entering our markets 
overall  the sales mix for fiscal was relatively consistent with fiscal  except for the atv category  which increased its share of the sales mix  driven by sales at new  larger format stores 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily due to a basis point increase from vendor co op funds  which in prior years were reflected as reductions in advertising expense because proof of performance for advertising programs had been required prior to fiscal while improvements in most product categories resulted in a basis point increase in product margins  reduced leverage in store occupancy costs offset the improvement 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  store operating expenses increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal net advertising expense increased basis points due primarily to the change in vendor co op funds discussed previously 
in fiscal  vendor co op funds were reflected as a reduction in inventory and cost of sales versus as a reduction in advertising expense in fiscal store payroll costs as a percentage of sales improved basis points in fiscal due to improved labor management and reduced performance bonus payouts 
these gains were partially offset by the fiscal impact of a change in our vacation policy 
depreciation expense as a percentage of sales increased basis points due to sales de leverage 
additionally  in fiscal  we incurred million in charges relating to the removal of waterfall displays from smaller format stores and the relocation of two stores 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal a reduction in our estimate of unredeemed gift card liability  based on historical redemption activity since the program introduction  had a basis point impact 
the basis point impact of no performance bonus payouts for fiscal was partially offset by the fiscal change in our vacation policy 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we opened new stores in fiscal  including two relocated stores  and we opened ten new stores in fiscal  including two relocated stores 
pre opening rent expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted from higher average net borrowings used to fund our growth during fiscal average interest rates on our credit facility were basis points higher in fiscal than in fiscal income tax provision 
we did not record an income tax provision for fiscal or  due to utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
we have determined the realization of the tax benefit related to our net deferred tax asset is uncertain at this time and a valuation allowance was recorded for the entire balance of our net deferred tax asset 
net income 
the net income of million for fiscal increased by million from the net income of million for fiscal  due to the factors discussed above 
preferred stock dividend 
we continued to reflect the accretion of cumulative unpaid dividends on our previously outstanding class a  b and c convertible preferred stock in accordance with accounting standards until the closing of our initial public offering 
no such dividends were paid  and any unpaid cumulative dividends were extinguished with the changes in capital structure associated with the closing of our initial public offering 
no such obligation or reduction to net income is reflected in our results of operations after may  fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended february  sales 
sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in sales resulted from a comparable store sales increase of million  or  and sales of million from ten additional stores  including eight new stores and two relocated stores  opened during fiscal in addition to the operating initiatives discussed above  the increase in comparable store sales was attributable to sales increases in our hunting category led by consistently strong performance in our firearms department 
firearms sales performance was enhanced by the launch of our co branded credit card in september  which provided customers with a to discount and a new financing option for these higher priced items 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales in the apparel and footwear categories due to unseasonably cool and wet weather in the first quarter of fiscal and flat sales of fishing rods and reels that were consistent with recent industry trends 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased basis points to from 
the increase was due primarily to enhanced vendor programs including specific items purchased at a discount for new store openings and a basis point reduction in occupancy costs as a percentage of sales as occupancy costs are substantially fixed in nature and the percentage decreases as sales increase 
an additional basis point improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales was the result of net revenue earned from our co branded credit card program 
these improvements were partially offset by reduced sales in the higher margin apparel and footwear categories as a percentage of sales and increased sales in the lower margin firearms category as a percentage of sales 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal store operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased basis points to in fiscal from in the decrease was primarily due to reduced payroll expenses and net advertising expenses as a percentage of sales  both as a result of our comparable store sales increases 
the decrease in payroll expenses as a percentage of sales was also due to improved labor scheduling basis points and a one time adjustment related to a change in our vacation policy basis points 
these improvements were partially offset by a basis point increase in employee bonus program expenses in recognition of our comparable store sales increases 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to sales growth outpacing increases in corporate infrastructure expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in all corporate department categories  most significantly in information systems as a result of a department realignment in fiscal a change in our vacation policy reduced general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by basis points 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in pre opening expenses was due to the opening of eight new stores and two relocated stores  including eight larger format stores  during fiscal compared to the opening of two new smaller format stores during fiscal interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense resulted from holiday companies conversion of a note payable into shares of our preferred stock in february and lower borrowing rates under our credit facility 
the reduction in interest expense was partially offset by higher average borrowings under our credit facility in fiscal income tax provision 
we recorded no income tax provision in fiscal compared to an income tax provision of million in fiscal we have determined that the realization of the tax benefit related to our net deferred tax asset is uncertain and a valuation allowance was recorded for the entire balance of our net deferred tax asset in fiscal and fiscal net income 
as a result of the above factors  net income was million in fiscal compared to a net loss of million in fiscal quarterly results of operations and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including the timing of new store openings and related expenses  profitability of new stores  weather conditions and general economic conditions 
our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuation  with the highest sales activity normally occurring during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year  which are primarily associated with the fall hunting seasons and the holiday season 
the first half of our fiscal years have averaged approximately of our annual sales  including new store sales  over the past two years 
however  this factor cannot necessarily be used as an indicator of future results 
our customers demand for our products and therefore our sales  can be significantly impacted by unseasonable weather conditions that affect outdoor activities and the demand for related apparel and equipment 
this seasonality also impacts our inventory levels  which tend to rise beginning approximately in april  reach a peak in november  and decline to lower levels after the december holiday season 
our pre opening expenses have and will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  primarily due to the timing of store openings 
we typically incur most pre opening expenses for a new store during the three months preceding  and the month of  its opening 
in addition  our labor and operating costs for a newly opened store can be greater during the first one to two months of operation than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of sales 
accordingly  the volume and timing of new store openings in any quarter has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on quarterly pre opening costs and store labor and operating expenses 
due to these factors  results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for a full fiscal year 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation restatement of financial statements and note to our financial statements included in this report for additional information 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for inventory  capital expenditures and pre opening expenses to support our new store growth plans  and  to the extent of the highly seasonal nature of our business  operating losses 
until the completion of our initial public offering  our main sources of liquidity were equity investments by  and advances from  holiday companies and its affiliated entities  and borrowings under our credit facility 
the following chart summarizes the principal elements of our cash flow for the past three fiscal years and the number of stores opened during the period 
cash flow summary fiscal year ended february  restated january  restated january  dollars in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities total net increase in cash details of financing activities proceeds repayments from holiday companies equity investments and advances  net borrowings under credit facility  net proceeds from sales of common stock  net of expenses total net cash provided by financing activities store openings  including relocated stores net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal and in fiscal  million of net cash was provided by operating activities 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects the increased inventory levels to support the new stores opened in fiscal the increase in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal compared to the net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal primarily reflects increased inventory levels to support the ten new stores opened during fiscal  as well as to support enhanced customer service by strengthening our inventory position 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities consists entirely of purchases of property and equipment 
we use cash for tenant improvements and equipment to open new and relocated stores and to remodel and upgrade existing stores 
net cash used in investing activities varied in the periods presented based on the number of stores opened during the period 
purchases of property and equipment also includes purchases of information technology systems and expenditures for our distribution facility and our corporate headquarters 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the financing activities during these periods were primarily related to financing the increased inventory levels and property and equipment purchases for store openings and  to the extent of the highly seasonal nature of our business  operating losses primarily incurred in the first half of our fiscal years 
on april   we closed the initial public offering of our common stock  selling  shares of common stock  including the underwriters over allotment  at a price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
transaction costs were million and have been reflected as a reduction of paid in capital 
the proceeds were used to eliminate our outstanding note payable to holiday companies in the amount of million and reduce million of outstanding indebtedness on our credit facility 
during fiscal  holiday companies advanced million to us in the form of subordinated debt of which million plus accrued interest of approximately million was converted into preferred stock in fiscal the remaining million was repaid by us during fiscal during fiscal  holiday companies advanced an additional million to us  all of which was repaid concurrent with the initial public offering 
during fiscal  we purchased property and equipment totaling million financed through capital lease transactions 
for one particular store location  we entered into a lease containing a bargain purchase option that is exercisable upon the cancellation of a note obligation by the economic development authority in the region 
we capitalized this lease obligation  resulting in the recording of building and equipment of million with a corresponding lease obligation of million 
these capital purchases are excluded from the caption purchase of property and equipment in our statements of cash flows for fiscal  along with million in equipment financed through other capital lease transactions in fiscal credit facility to meet our liquidity and capital needs  we entered into a credit facility with fleet retail finance in fiscal as amended in february  this credit facility provided for revolving loans in an aggregate amount of up to million including up to million in the form of letters of credit 
in february  we completed an amendment to the credit facility that increased the amount of the facility from million to million and extended the maturity date to june the facility can be increased to million if we are not in default under the agreement 
the actual availability under our credit facility is limited to of eligible credit card receivables plus the lesser of to of our eligible inventory or of our inventory s liquidation value  in each case net of specified reserves and less any letters of credit outstanding 
interest on the outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility currently accrues at the lender s prime commercial lending rate plus to depending on our ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  or  if we elect  at the one  two  three or six month libor plus to depending on such ebitda 
interests in substantially all of our assets secure our obligations under the credit facility 
outstanding borrowings under the credit facility  as of january  and january   were million and million  respectively 
our total remaining borrowing capacity under the credit facility  after subtracting letters of credit  as of january  and january   was million and million  respectively 
financial covenants under the credit facility as of january  require that operating cash flow and ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  meet certain levels as adjusted over time 
the credit facility also contains other covenants that  among other matters  restrict our ability to incur substantial other indebtedness  create certain liens  engage in certain mergers and acquisitions  sell assets  enter into certain capital leases or make junior payments  including cash dividends 
of the million advanced to us by holiday companies in fiscal  million was advanced in order to ensure our compliance with the ebitda covenant 
at january   we were in compliance with financial covenants and out of compliance with a non financial covenant under the credit facility relating to notice of our reincorporation in the state of minnesota  but we subsequently received waivers curing the noncompliance 
as of january   we were in compliance with all covenants 
future capital requirements our future capital requirements will primarily depend on the number of new stores we open and the timing of those openings within a given fiscal year 
these requirements will include costs directly related to opening new stores and may also include costs necessary to ensure that our infrastructure  including technology and distribution capabilities  is able to support a larger store base 
we opened new stores in fiscal  including two relocated stores  and our cash used in investing activities was million 
we currently plan to open to stores in fiscal  including three or four relocations and consolidations 
in fiscal  we plan to invest approximately million to upgrade the product handling equipment in our distribution center 
however  business conditions  business strategy or other factors may cause us to adjust such plans 
additional needs for capital include funding seasonal inventory levels and seasonal losses from operations 
we intend to satisfy our capital requirements in fiscal with cash flows from operations  funds available under our credit facility and equipment financing leases 
however  if capital requirements for our business strategy change  or other factors change our capital requirements  we may need to seek additional financing in the public or private markets 
there is no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
beyond fiscal  we anticipate needing additional financing to sustain our growth rate 
interest rate risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest income from cash equivalents and our interest expense on borrowings under our credit facility 
we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on january  our floating rate indebtedness was approximately million at january  and million at january  if short term floating interest rates on the average fiscal and fiscal variable rate debt had changed by basis points  our annual interest expense would have changed by approximately million and million  respectively  assuming comparable borrowing levels 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our average amount of floating rate indebtedness outstanding and cash equivalents balances for the respective fiscal years 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended january  we cannot assure you that inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition in future periods 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments the following table contains supplemental information regarding our total contractual obligations as of january  we have no long term debt 
payments due by pay period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations capital lease obligations total includes store operating leases  which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs  primarily common area costs and real estate taxes  in addition to rent 
these obligation amounts include future minimum lease payments and exclude direct operating costs 
these obligations are not recorded in our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into arrangements with vendors to purchase merchandise in advance of expected delivery 
because these purchase orders do not contain any termination payments or other penalties if cancelled  they are not included in this table of contractual obligations 
these obligations are not recorded in our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
includes standby and documentary letters of credit outstanding in connection with the importing of merchandise  as well as for insurance purposes 
also includes other obligations for miscellaneous goods and services acquired  related primarily to marketing and advertising obligations  as well as obligations relating to the upgrade of equipment in our distribution center 
these obligations are not recorded in our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
includes the payment obligation associated with the capital lease of one of our stores  which provides for a maximum  payment quarterly for years from lease inception 
this obligation will be reduced by allowable sales tax credits as defined in the related development agreement 
we can not estimate the amounts of these future credits  and accordingly  have not reduced payment obligations by any allowable credits 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
r in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  known as sfas no 
r 
it supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
and it amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r also supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires us to record stock compensation expense as stock compensation awards vest  which is a change from our current accounting treatment under sfas no 
while the fair value method under sfas no 
r is very similar to the fair value method under sfas no 
with regard to measurement and recognition of stock based compensation  management is currently evaluating the impact of several of the key differences between the two standards on our financial statements 
for example  sfas no 
permits us to recognize forfeitures as they occur while sfas no 
r will require us to estimate future forfeitures and adjust our estimate on a quarterly basis 
sfas no 
r will also require a classification change in the statement of cash flows whereby a portion of the tax benefit from stock options will move from operating cash flows to financing cash flows total cash flows will remain unchanged 
estimates of option values under current pro forma disclosures using the black scholes method may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted under sfas no 
r 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r at the beginning of fiscal  as required under the sec s rule announced april  we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r  and expect that the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
r could have a material impact on net income and earnings per share 
under our stock option plan  we have  options outstanding to purchase our common stock as of january   with the ability to exercise being contingent upon the attainment of a per share price for our common stock as of the end of a fiscal year based upon the higher of the closing price on the last day of the fiscal year or a five day trailing average of our stock price taken at that time 
the options have a year life and vest in equal annual increments over three years beginning june   subject to the attainment of the price per share at a fiscal year end 
the exercise price is per share 
if the price of our common stock reaches at a fiscal year end  we will recognize approximately million in expense  net of tax  assuming an effective tax rate of  over the vesting period described above 
sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets  which eliminates the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no

in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
eitf no 
in fiscal  we adopted emerging issues task force consensus no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
under this guidance  the presumption is that cash consideration received from a vendor should be classified as a reduction of costs of sales 
if the consideration received represents a payment for assets delivered to the vendor  it should be classified as revenue 
if the consideration is a reimbursement of a specific  incremental  identifiable cost incurred in selling the vendor s product  the cost should be characterized as a reduction of the cost incurred 
the guidance was effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our net earnings or financial position 
sfas no 
in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
clarifies the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  and is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  or otherwise for the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our financial positions or results of operations 
sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had  and is not expected to have  a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
fin in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires the consolidation of and disclosures about variable interest entities  or vies 
vies are entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights 
fin has not had  and is not expected to have  a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements  we are required to make assumptions  make estimates and apply judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant at the time the financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
inventory valuation we maintain inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we reduce inventory costs for estimates of vendor allowances  such as volume rebates  new store purchase discounts  cooperative advertising allowances and other discounts 
markdown reserves are established based primarily on forecasted consumer demand  inventory aging and obsolescence 
if our estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or other changes impact demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses in excess of our established reserves that could be material 
we also establish inventory loss reserves 
we estimate a provision for these losses based on independent  periodic physical inventory counts 
we accrue for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location by location basis  based on a number of factors  including historical results 
if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses in excess of our established reserves that could be material 
we are not aware of any events or changes in demand or price that would indicate to us that our inventory valuation may be too high or too low at this time 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future  undiscounted net cash flows estimated by us to be generated by these assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
our impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values and to determine the useful lives of the assets 
using this impairment review methodology  we recorded a long lived asset impairment charge of million in fiscal if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates regarding these factors  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
costs associated with exit activities the calculation of our location closing liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the timing and duration of future vacancy periods  the amount and timing of future lump sum settlement payments and the amount and timing of potential future sublease income 
when making these assumptions  we consider a number of factors  including historical settlement experience  the owner of the property  the location and condition of the property  the terms of the underlying lease  the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to additional charges that could be material 
we are not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that would require calculation of a location closing liability at this time 
insurance we retain a portion of the risk related to certain general liability  workers compensation  property loss and employee medical and dental claims 
liabilities associated with these losses are calculated for claims filed  and claims incurred but not yet reported  at our estimate of their ultimate cost  based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates 
our expected loss accruals are based on estimates  and while we believe the amounts accrued are adequate  the ultimate loss may differ from the amounts provided 
risks and factors affecting current and future results our current business strategy that focuses on larger format retail stores has not been proven successful on a long term basis and may negatively impact our operating results 
in fiscal  we began implementing our current business strategy that focuses on larger format retail stores 
the viability of this business strategy has not been proven on a long term basis 
we recently transitioned from opening approximately  square foot stores to predominantly opening stores ranging from  to  square feet 
the results we achieved at our smaller format stores may not be indicative of the results that we may achieve at our new larger format stores 
the larger format increases our operating costs per store  but may not lead to proportionately increased revenues per store 
our mix of higher and lower margin merchandise in our larger format stores differs from the merchandise mix in our smaller stores  and therefore  may negatively impact our gross margins in our larger format stores 
in addition  we may not carry the appropriate merchandise mix during our busiest seasons in our larger format stores 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our larger format stores on a profitable basis 
if a larger format store is unprofitable  the impact on our financial results could be greater than the impact of an unprofitable smaller format store 
our concentration of stores in the north central united states makes us susceptible to adverse conditions in this region  including atypical weather 
the majority of our stores are located in the north central united states 
as a result  our operations are more susceptible to regional factors than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors 
these factors include regional economic and weather conditions  natural disasters  demographic and population changes and governmental regulations in the states in which we operate 
environmental changes and disease epidemics affecting fish or game populations in this region  such as chronic wasting disease  may also affect our sales 
if the region were to suffer an economic downturn or other adverse event  our operating results could suffer 
our results of operations may be harmed by unseasonably warm winter weather conditions 
many of our stores are located in areas that traditionally experience seasonably cold weather 
abnormally warm weather conditions  such as those that occurred from september through december in the north central united states  could reduce our sales of these items and harm our operating results 
moreover  significant snowfalls on peak shopping days  particularly during the holiday season  could impact our sales if potential customers choose not to shop during those days 
our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations and the timing of new store openings  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we experience substantial seasonal fluctuations in our sales and operating results 
in addition  we typically open new stores during the second half of the year  which increases the percentage of our sales generated in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
in fiscal  we generated of our annual sales in our third fiscal quarter  which includes the fall hunting season months of september and october  and we generated of our annual sales in our fourth fiscal quarter  which includes the peak cold weather and holiday season months of november and december 
we incur significant additional expenses in the third and fourth fiscal quarters due to higher purchase volumes and increased staffing in our stores 
if  for any reason  we miscalculate the demand for our products or our product mix during the third or fourth fiscal quarters  our sales in these quarters could decline resulting in significantly lower margins and excess inventory  which could cause our annual operating results to suffer and our stock price to decline significantly 
the growth of our business will be dependent upon the availability of adequate capital 
the growth of our business will depend on the availability of adequate capital  which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing 
we cannot assure you that our operations will generate positive cash flow or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on acceptable terms or at all 
our credit facility contains provisions that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales that might otherwise be used to finance our expansion 
security interests in substantially all of our assets  which may further limit our access to certain capital markets or lending sources  secure our obligations under the credit facility 
moreover  the actual availability of funds under our credit facility is limited to specified percentages of our eligible inventory and credit card receivables 
accordingly  opportunities for increasing our cash on hand through sales of inventory would be partially offset by reduced availability under our credit facility 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will be able to finance our current expansion plans 
our expansion into new  unfamiliar markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new markets 
pursuant to our growth strategy  we intend to open stores in new markets 
we anticipate that the initial stores opened in a new market will not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until approximately their third year of operations  due in large part to factors that generally affect store performance in new markets 
these factors include less familiarity with local customer preferences  difficulties in attracting customers due to a reduced level of customer familiarity with our brand  difficulties in hiring a sufficient number of qualified store associates and other matters 
in addition  entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new  unfamiliar competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis 
our expansion strategy includes further penetration of our existing markets  which could cause sales at our existing stores to decline 
pursuant to our expansion strategy  we intend to open additional stores in our existing markets 
because our stores typically draw customers from their local areas  a new store may draw customers away from nearby existing stores and may cause sales performance and customer counts at those existing stores to decline  which may adversely affect our overall operating results 
an inability to find suitable new store sites or delays in new store openings could materially affect our financial performance 
in order to meet our growth objectives  we will need to secure an adequate number of suitable new store sites 
we require that all proposed store sites satisfy strict criteria regarding cost and location established by us 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to find a sufficient number of suitable new sites for any planned expansion in any future period 
our expected financial performance is based on our new stores opening on expected dates 
it is possible that events such as problems with our credit  delays in the entitlements process or construction delays caused by permitting or licensing issues  material shortages  labor issues  weather delays or other acts of god  discovery of contaminants  accidents  deaths or injunctions could delay planned new store openings beyond their expected dates or force us to abandon planned openings altogether 
any failure on our part to recognize or respond to these issues may adversely affect our sales growth  which in turn may adversely affect our future operating results 
if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business  our operating results and financial condition could suffer 
our performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management  including our chief executive officer and president  mark baker  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  dennis lindahl  our executive vice president  merchandising  allen dittrich  our senior vice president  finance and administration  sharon link  our senior vice president  store operations  andrew carlin  and our senior vice president  marketing  curt avallone 
none of our employees  except messrs 
baker  lindahl and dittrich and ms 
link  has an employment agreement with us and we do not have key person insurance covering any of our employees 
if we lose the services of one or more of our key executives  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our growth objectives 
as our business grows  we will need to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in a timely manner 
we rely on a single distribution center  and if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at the facility  we may be unable to deliver merchandise effectively to our stores 
we rely on a single distribution center in lebanon  indiana 
any natural disaster or other serious disruption at this facility due to fire  tornado  flood or any other cause could damage a portion of our inventory or impair our ability to use our distribution center as a docking location for merchandise 
either of these occurrences could impair our ability to adequately stock our stores and harm our operating results 
our planned growth may strain our business infrastructure  which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we expect to grow at a rapid pace 
as we grow  we will face the risk that our existing resources and systems  including management resources  accounting and finance personnel and operating systems  may be inadequate to support our growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain the personnel or make the changes in our systems that may be required to support our growth 
failure to secure these resources and implement these systems could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  the retention of additional personnel and the implementation of changes and enhancements to our systems will require capital expenditures and other increased costs that could also have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
our expansion in new and existing markets may also create new distribution and merchandising challenges  including strain on our distribution center  an increase in information to be processed by our management information systems and diversion of management attention from operations towards the opening of new stores and markets 
based on our current growth strategy we will need to increase our distribution capabilities within the next few years  which could disrupt our business operations 
to the extent that we are not able to meet these additional challenges  our sales could decrease and our operating expenses could increase 
we have a history of significant losses and have only recently achieved profitability 
if we do not remain profitable  our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could suffer 
we incurred annual net losses from the formation of our company until fiscal we had negative cash flow from operations in fiscal and fiscal  and as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to increase our expenses significantly to expand our store base 
we may not generate sufficient revenue to offset these expenditures and our losses might be greater than the losses we would incur if we developed our business more slowly 
as a result  we may incur significant operating losses and may be unable to maintain our recent profitability 
if our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate  or if our cost of goods sold or operating expenses exceed our expectations  our operating results would be harmed and the trading price of our common stock could suffer 
our business depends on our ability to meet our labor needs 
our success depends in part upon our ability to attract  motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  including general managers  assistant managers  customer service representatives and store associates  who understand and appreciate our we live outdoors culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers 
qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas  and the turnover rate in the retail industry is high 
if we are unable to hire and retain sales associates capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service  as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and knowledge of our merchandise  our business could be materially adversely affected 
although none of our employees is currently covered by collective bargaining agreements  we cannot guarantee that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future  which could increase our labor costs 
additionally  competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees 
an inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay the planned openings of new stores 
any such delays  any material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores or any increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
if we fail to anticipate changes in consumer demands  including regional preferences  in a timely manner  our operating results could suffer 
our products appeal to consumers who regularly hunt  fish  camp and boat 
the preferences of these consumers cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change 
in addition  due to different types of fish and game stocks and different weather conditions found in different markets  it is critical that our stores stock appropriate products for their markets 
our success depends on our ability to identify product trends in a variety of markets as well as to anticipate  gauge and react to changing consumer demands in these markets in a timely manner 
if we misjudge the market for our products  our sales may decline significantly and we may face significant excess inventory of some products and missed opportunities for other products  which could harm our operating results 
we have been named a defendant in securities class action litigation and a derivative action and we may in the future be named in additional litigation  any of which may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
as described in legal proceedings  a number of shareholder class action suits have been filed naming us and or certain of our current and former officers and directors as co defendants 
a related derivative action has been filed naming certain of our officers and directors 
we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this litigation 
it is possible that this litigation could be resolved adversely to us  could result in substantial costs and could divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business 
in addition to securities class action litigation  we face legal risks in our business  including claims from disputes with our employees and our former employees and claims associated with product liability 
risks associated with legal liability often are difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time 
while we maintain director and officer insurance  as well as general and product liability insurance  the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover a claim and the continued availability of this insurance cannot be assured 
we may in the future be the target of additional litigation and this litigation may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
our agreement with cabela s could limit our ability to respond to competition or changing market conditions 
we are subject to a noncompetition agreement with cabela s that may require us to grant an exclusive license to certain of our trademarks that were in existence in to cabela s for its use in what the agreement defines as the direct marketing business if we engage in active steps to enter the direct marketing business ourselves 
we have developed various trademarks since  but we continue to use some significant trademarks in our business 
the terms of this agreement could have the effect of limiting our ability to respond to competition or changing market conditions 
if and when we take active steps to reenter the direct marketing business  substantial questions regarding the scope of the rights and obligations of the parties to the agreement with respect to our trademarks  as well as the threshold question of the agreement s enforceability  will need to be addressed 
it is currently difficult to evaluate and predict with certainty the future impact of the agreement on the way we may operate our business 
on july   we filed an arbitration demand with the american arbitration association seeking arbitration of certain issues arising under the noncompetition agreement with cabela s 
on july   we also filed a complaint in the us district court for the district of minnesota seeking a declaratory judgment that a trademark licensing provision of the agreement is unenforceable 
although the noncompetition provisions of the agreement expired in june  cabela s contends that the agreement may require us to grant cabela s a license to certain of our trademarks that were in existence in if it is determined that we have engaged in active steps to re enter a direct marketing business as defined in the agreement 
we filed the arbitration demand and the complaint to seek clarification as to the interpretation and enforceability of the agreement 
cabela s has denied the claims in the complaint and the arbitration demand 
the federal court proceeding is currently stayed and a hearing is scheduled in the arbitration for june discovery in the arbitration is currently underway 
we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this litigation  but it may be costly and disruptive 
the total costs may not be reasonably estimated at this time 
the outcome of this dispute may impact the manner in which we market our products in the future 
our computer hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage that could harm our business 
our success  in particular our ability to successfully manage inventory levels  largely depends upon the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems 
we use management information systems to track inventory information at the store level  communicate customer information and aggregate daily sales  margin and promotional information 
these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  tornado and other natural disasters  power loss  computer system failures  internet and telecommunications or data network failures  operator negligence  improper operation by or supervision of employees  physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches  misappropriation and similar events  computer viruses and trojan horses  and upgrades  installations of major software releases and integration with new systems 
any failure that causes an interruption in our systems processing could disrupt our operations and result in reduced sales 
we have centralized the majority of our computer systems in our corporate office 
it is possible that an event or disaster at our corporate office could materially and adversely affect the performance of our company and the ability of each of our stores to operate efficiently 
if any of our key vendors fails to supply us with merchandise  we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our sales could decline 
our ten largest vendors collectively represented approximately of our total purchases in fiscal  with no single vendor representing greater than of our total purchases 
our vendors could discontinue selling products to us at any time 
the loss of any key vendor or key vendor support for any reason could limit our ability to offer products that our customers want to purchase 
in addition  we believe many of our vendors obtain their products from china  taiwan  korea  mexico and other foreign countries 
a vendor could discontinue selling to us products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or the vendor s control  including foreign government regulations  political unrest  war  disruption or delays in shipments  changes in local economic conditions and trade issues 
our operating results could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
we have considered acquisitions in the past and we may from time to time acquire complementary companies or businesses 
acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies  and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management s attention from other business issues and opportunities 
we may not be able to successfully integrate companies that we acquire  including their personnel  financial systems  distribution  operations and general store operating procedures 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquired companies  our business could suffer 
in addition  the integration of any acquired business  and its financial results  into ours may adversely affect our operating results 
risks related to our industry a downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items  which could harm our operating results 
in general  our sales represent discretionary spending by our customers 
discretionary spending is affected by many factors  including  among others general business conditions  interest rates  inflation  consumer debt levels  the availability of consumer credit  taxation  fuel prices and electrical power rates  unemployment trends  terrorist attacks and acts of war  and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
our customers purchases of discretionary items  including our products  could decline during periods when disposable income is lower or periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions 
if this occurs  our operating results could suffer 
competition in the outdoor products industry could limit our growth and harm our operating results 
the retail market for outdoor products is highly fragmented and competitive 
our current and prospective competitors include many large companies that have substantially greater market presence  name recognition  and financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we compete directly or indirectly with the following categories of companies local specialty stores  traditional sporting goods chains  such as the sports authority  dick s sporting goods and academy  catalog and internet based retailers  such as cabela s  bass pro and sportsman s guide  large format entertainment focused outdoor retailers  such as cabela s and bass pro  regional outdoor focused chains  such as sportsman s warehouse  discount chains and mass merchants  such as wal mart  kmart and target corporation  and marinas and marine supply stores  such as west marine and boater s world 
pressure from our competitors could require us to reduce our prices or increase our spending for advertising and promotion  which  due to our every day low price strategy  would erode our margins 
increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of innovative store formats  aggressive pricing strategies and retail sale methods  such as the internet  could cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to product liability claims relating to our sale of outdoor equipment and firearms  and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims 
we may incur damages due to lawsuits relating to outdoor equipment that we sell 
for example  we sell tree stands  which are equipment that hunters attach to trees to allow them to sit above the ground while hunting  and have been sued in the past and may incur damages in the future due to lawsuits relating to injuries or deaths associated with the tree stands sold by us 
in addition  we sell rifles  shotguns and handguns  along with archery equipment  which are products that are associated with an increased risk of injury and death 
we may incur damages due to lawsuits relating to the improper use of firearms sold by us  including lawsuits by municipalities or other organizations attempting to recover costs from firearm manufacturers and retailers relating to the misuse of firearms 
we may also be subject to lawsuits relating to our performance of background checks on firearms purchasers as mandated by state and federal law 
in fiscal  we also began selling all terrain vehicle atvs  motorized vehicles designed for off road use 
lawsuits relating to the products we sell could result in substantial liability  which would adversely affect our business and financial condition 
there is a risk that claims or liabilities relating to products we sell will exceed our insurance coverage and we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future 
in addition  the commencement of lawsuits against us relating to our sale of outdoor equipment or firearms could cause us to reduce our sales of those products 
increased regulation of the sale of firearms could cause us to reduce our firearm sales  which could harm our operating results 
increased federal  state or local regulation  including taxation  of the sale of firearms in our current markets or in future markets in which we may operate could cause us to reduce our firearm sales 
sales of firearms represented approximately of our sales in fiscal  and a substantial reduction in our sales of firearms due to the establishment of new regulations could harm our operating results 
some of the products and services we sell are highly regulated  which could lead to high compliance costs 
we are subject to regulation by the bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms and explosives  the consumer product safety commission  the occupational safety and health administration and similar state regulatory agencies 
if we fail to comply with government and industry safety standards  we may be subject to claims  lawsuits  fines and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  regulations issued by the bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms and explosives may delay our ability to change certain of our officers and prohibit some individuals from serving in certain of our offices

risks related to ownership of our company by the erickson family and their affiliates members of the erickson family and their affiliates collectively own a controlling interest in us 
the erickson family founded and controls the companies that own  operate and franchise holiday stationstore gasoline convenience stores located throughout the northern tier of the united states 
members of the erickson family collectively own a controlling interest in us through a combination of their individual stock ownership in us and their control of our largest shareholder  holiday stationstores  inc we have been advised that members of the erickson family have no existing agreement or arrangement to act in concert with respect to the voting or disposition of their respective ownership interests 
erickson family members and their affiliates own a controlling interest in our company and these individuals and entities may have interests that differ from those of our other shareholders 
as of april   members of the erickson family  together with holiday stationstores  inc  which is wholly owned by members of the erickson family or entities they control  collectively owned more than of our common stock 
as a result  holiday stationstores  inc and members of the erickson family are able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other extraordinary transactions 
they may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests 
the concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  preventing or deterring a change in control of our company  could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  conflicts of interest may arise as a result of the continued collective controlling ownership interest of holiday stationstores  inc and the members of the erickson family 
we may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts  and even if we do  the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with unaffiliated parties 
these conflicts may include the structure and timing of transfers by holiday stationstores  inc and members of the erickson family of all or any portion of their ownership interest in us and the ability of holiday stationstores  inc and members of the erickson family to control our management and affairs 
the actual or potential sale by erickson family members and their affiliates of their holdings of our common stock could cause the market price of our stock to decline significantly 
as of april   members of the erickson family and their affiliates collectively owned more than million shares of our common stock 
no members of the erickson family or the entities they control are subject to any contractual obligations to retain their controlling interest 
holiday stationstores  inc and certain individual members of the erickson family have rights to cause us to register their shares 
a sale by the erickson family or their affiliates of a large interest in us  or the perception that such a sale could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly 
two of our directors may have conflicts of interest in certain circumstances because they are members of the erickson family and directors and officers of the erickson family s affiliates 
members of the erickson family that serve as directors of our company are directors or officers of companies affiliated with the erickson family that are shareholders of our company  which may create conflicts of interest when our board of directors faces decisions that affect both us and such companies 
this includes the chairman of our board of directors  ronald erickson  who is the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of holiday companies and holiday stationstores  inc  and gerald erickson  another of our directors who is also vice president and vice chairman of the board of directors of holiday companies and a director of holiday stationstores  inc in the ordinary course of business we provide material  non public information about our company to ronald erickson and to gerald erickson 
although people who receive material non public information about our company are subject to federal law regarding their use of such information  we cannot control their use of such information  which may be adverse to the interests of other shareholders 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest income from cash equivalents and our interest expense on borrowings under our credit facility 
we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on january  our floating rate indebtedness was approximately million at january  and million at january  if short term floating interest rates on the average fiscal and fiscal variable rate debt had changed by basis points  our annual interest expense would have change by approximately million and million  respectively  assuming comparable borrowing levels 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our average amount of floating rate indebtedness outstanding and cash equivalents balances for each of the respective fiscal years 
we have not contracted for any derivative financial instruments
