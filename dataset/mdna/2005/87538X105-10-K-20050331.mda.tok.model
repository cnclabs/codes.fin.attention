item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we intend for the following discussion to provide you with information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 
this discussion also provides information about the financial results of the various segments of our business so you may better understand how those segments and their results affect our financial condition and results of operations as a whole 
finally  we have identified and discussed trends known to management that we believe are likely to have a material effect 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements as of december  and and the two years then ended and the notes accompanying those financial statements 
you are also urged to consider the information under the caption summary of critical accounting policies 
summary we are the world s largest specialty retailer and wholesale distributor of leather and leathercraft related items 
our operations are centered on operating retail stores and warehouse distribution centers 
we have built our business by offering our customers quality products in one location at competitive prices 
the key to our success is our ability to grow our base business 
we grow that business by opening new locations and by increasing sales in our existing locations 
we intend to continue to expand both domestically  in the short term  and internationally  in the long term 
we operate in three segments 
first  wholesale leathercraft  consisting of our leather factory warehouse distribution centers and our national account group  is the largest source of revenues million in 
this division has generally offered steady but modest increases in sales 
sales in were flat compared to sales in  falling short of our target of annual sales growth of to 
the decrease in sales to national accounts in accounted for the shortfall 
excluding national account sales  the distribution centers produced a sales gain of for since acquiring its assets in  we have focused on re establishing tandy leather as the operator of retail leathercraft stores 
these retail stores comprise our second segment  retail leathercraft 
because of growth here  this segment has experienced the greatest increases in sales million in  up from million in 
our business plan calls for opening an average of stores annually as we work toward a goal of stores from stores at the end of our third segment is roberts  cushman  a manufacturer of trimmings for headwear 
its operations are not material to us 
in  we wrote off the goodwill related to our investment in roberts  cushman in connection with an accounting change 
on a consolidated basis  a key indicator of costs  gross margin as a percent of total net sales  increased in and again in  reflecting a number of factors including more retail sales with higher profit margins 
however  opening additional tandy leather stores  more dollars spent on employee benefits  and new costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance in resulted in a increase in operating expenses as a percent of total net sales in operating expenses were also up as a percentage of total net sales in when compared with as a result of opening additional tandy leather stores and more dollars spent on advertising 
we reported consolidated net income for of million 
consolidated net income for was also million 
in  we reported a consolidated net loss of million due to an accounting change 
we have used our cash flow to fund our operations  to fund the opening of new tandy leather stores and to reduce our bank debt 
in  we reduced our bank debt by million  and  at the end of  our stockholders equity had increased to million from million the previous year 
comparing the december  balance sheet with the prior year s  we increased our investments in inventory million from million and accounts receivable million from million  while total cash increased to million from million 
in addition to cash on hand  we have a million bank line of credit  of which  was drawn on december  net sales net sales for the three years ended december  were as follows year wholesale leathercraft retail leathercraft cushman total company total company increase from prior year our net sales grew by in when compared with and in when compared with these annual increases resulted primarily from our retail leathercraft expansion program 
costs and expenses in general  our gross profit as a percentage of sales our gross margin fluctuates based on the mix of customers we serve  the mix of product we sell  and our ability to source product globally 
our negotiations with suppliers for lower pricing is an on going process and we have varying degrees of success in those endeavors 
sales to retail customers tend to produce higher gross margins than sales to wholesale customers due to the difference in pricing levels 
therefore  as retail sales increase in the overall sales mix  higher gross margins tend to follow 
finally  there is significant fluctuation in gross margins between the various merchandise categories we offer 
as a result  our gross margins can vary depending on the mix of products sold during any given time period 
for  our cost of sales decreased as a percentage of total net sales when compared to  resulting in an overall increase of in the company s gross margin from in to in similarly  our total cost of sales as a percentage of our total net sales had decreased for when compared to resulting in an overall increase in gross margin of from for to in these increases in gross margin were primarily due to increased retail sales over the three years 
our gross margins for the three years ended december  were as follows year wholesale leathercraft retail leathercraft cushman total company our operating expenses increased as a percentage of total net sales to in when compared with in this increase was primarily due to operating costs associated with the twelve tandy stores opened in an increase of  bonuses awarded to corporate and operational management  the cost of employee health care an increase of  an increase in advertising expenses  and expenses associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we believe that our advertising efforts particularly our direct mail campaigns generate sales 
as we expand into new markets  the number of customers and potential customers increases resulting in an increase in the number of direct mail pieces produced and distributed 
while we monitor our advertising costs with great scrutiny  management believes that the trend of increased advertising and marketing costs could continue for at least the near future 
we have completed the initial phase of design and documentation in our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act with the assistance of outside consultants 
while additional and on going testing of our control processes is necessary  we hope to complete the majority of that work without the need for significant outside assistance 
management is analyzing the status of this project to determine if we will be able to accomplish this work satisfactorily with internal staff 
if not  we will incur additional costs in for  operating expenses increased as a percentage of total net sales to in when compared with this increase was primarily due to operating costs rents  utilities  telephones  etc 
associated with the twelve tandy stores opened in an increase of  as well as an increase in advertising expenses an increase of  and investor relation expenses an increase of 
other expenses net other expenses net  which consists primarily of interest expense and currency exchange gain and loss  was  in compared to  in  a decrease of approximately 
this decrease is attributable to the interest paid on our outstanding debt 
in  other expenses net were  in compared to  in  a decrease of approximately 
our interest expense continues to decrease due to the reduction in our outstanding bank debt 
the currency exchange gain and loss  resulting from our canadian operation  was a gain of  in compared to a gain of  in net income during  we earned net income of million  a slight decrease from our net income of million for the overall improvement in gross margin and a reduction in interest and other expenses contributed positively to our net income while increased operating expenses and income tax expense in offset that improvement 
during  we earned net income of million  a substantial increase over our net loss of million for as discussed in previous filings  a new accounting pronouncement required us to record a million charge against earnings as a result of the write off of the goodwill of roberts  cushman in  resulting in a net loss 
this charge was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
net income before the change was million 
as a result of the increase in our overall gross margin and a reduction in interest and other expenses  our profits in grew at a rate faster than sales 
partially offsetting gross margin and other expense improvements were increased operating expenses in as discussed above 
re categorization of operating divisions until the fourth quarter of  we provided division or segment information on a legal entity basis 
more specifically  the leather factory segment consisted of us based warehouse distribution centers and canadian based warehouse distribution centers which were owned and operated by the legal entity of the same name 
the tandy leather segment consisted of the expanding us based retail store chain which was owned and operated by tandy leather company 
with the opening of our calgary store in october  which is owned by the leather factory but operated as a tandy leather retail store  management has determined that it is more useful to provide segment financial information based upon wholesale and retail operating divisions rather than on a legal entity basis 
the acquisition of the three canadian retail stores of heritan ltd in december  which are owned by the leather factory but operated as tandy leather stores  further strengthened our decision to make a change in the way we report divisional  or segment  information 
if we continued entity reporting  the segments would be as follows as of as of leather factory leather factory locations in us locations in us locations in canada locations in canada tandy leather tandy leather retail stores in us retail stores in us warehouse distribution centers and retail stores changing reporting to a wholesale and retail division reporting  the segments are as follows as of as of wholesale wholesale locations in us locations in us locations in canada locations in canada retail retail retail stores in us retail stores in us retail stores in canada as indicated in the tables above  this change in divisional reporting does not affect prior periods for comparison purposes as there were no retail stores in the leather factory legal entity until october wholesale leathercraft formerly referred to as leather factory segment year net sales incr decr from prior yr operating income operating income incr decr from prior year operating income as a percentage of sales wholesale leathercraft  consisting of warehouse distribution centers  accounted for of total company net sales in  which compares to in and in the decrease in this division s contribution to our total net sales is the result of the growth in retail leathercraft and we expect this trend to continue 
the net sales decrease in resulted from a decrease in national account sales offset by gains to our wholesale and small manufacturing customer groups 
our sales mix by customer group was as follows customer group retail institution wholesale national accounts manufacturers the decrease in operating income as a percentage of divisional sales resulted from an increase of in operating expenses as a percentage of sales compared with  partially offset by an increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales of 
the operating expense increase as a percent of sales in was higher than due to bonuses awarded to corporate and operational management  for and the cost of our employee health benefits an increase of 
in addition  we spent  with outside consultants on our sarbanes oxley project 
being the largest division  wholesale leathercraft bears the majority of the pro rata allocation of corporate expenses 
the decrease in operating income as a percentage of sales resulted from a decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales and an increase of in operating expenses as a percentage of sales compared with the gross margin decline was driven primarily by an increase in the quantities of leather sold during the year 
given that leather is our lowest gross margin item  an increase in leather sales  all other factors being equal  will result in a lower overall gross margin 
our freight costs shipping merchandise from vendors to us were up in as well due an increase in the number of air shipments versus ocean shipments 
the operating expense increase as a percent of sales in was higher than advertising and marketing costs are a significant expense in our operation as we believe there is a direct correlation between how much we advertise and how much product we sell 
our increase in investor outreach programs in also contributed to the decline in operating income this year 
retail leathercraft formerly referred to as tandy leather segment year net sales increase from prior yr operating income operating income incr decr from prior year operating income as a percentage of sales reflecting the growth previously discussed  retail leathercraft accounted for of our total net sales in  up from in and in growth in net sales for retail leathercraft division in and resulted primarily from our expansion program 
expansion during and consisted of the opening of and new stores  respectively 
our sales mix by customer group was as follows customer group retail institution wholesale national accounts manufacturers operating income as a percentage of sales increased to for compared to for gross margin decreased from in to in due primarily to limitations in increasing selling prices to match cost increases 
selling prices are set at the time the product catalog is produced 
as a result  it is difficult to implement price increases to customers until we distribute a new catalog 
historically  we distribute our new catalog at the beginning of each calendar year and did so in january however  due to the cost increases in metals  fuel  and other items this year and the need to pass on these increases to customers  we accelerated that schedule and distributed our catalog on november  operating expenses as a percent of sales in decreased by  from for to for as sales and gross margin grew at a faster pace than that of operating expenses 
operating income as a percentage of sales increased in when compared to segment gross margin increased from in to in due to increased retail sales and more efficient purchasing of product from vendors 
segment operating expenses as a percent of sales increased by in expanded advertising initiatives and rent for store space accounted for the operating expense increase  offset partially by a decrease in costs to ship merchandise to customers 
the decrease in shipping is a result of the store expansion as more sales occur in the stores as compared to ordering via mail  phone or the internet 
we intend to continue the expansion of tandy leather s retail store chain in by opening a total of new stores throughout the year 
as of march   we have opened two new stores this year van nuys  ca and phoenix  az 
we remain committed to a conservative expansion plan for this division that minimizes risks to our profits and maintains financial stability 
roberts  cushman year net sales incr decr from prior yr operating income loss operating income incr decr from prior year operating income as a percentage of sales the roberts  cushman operation accounted for of our total sales in compared with and in and  respectively 
for  roberts  cushman s sales were up while gross profit margins decreased slightly from to 
operating income increased from  in to  for sales grew faster than operating expenses which accounted for the improvement in operating income 
the decrease in roberts  cushman s net sales resulted from the continued slowdown in the headwear industry overall 
several of our customers hat manufacturers are on shortened work weeks due to the decline in orders 
segment gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased from however  operating income improved modestly 
roberts  cushman s sales and profits are immaterial to our company as a whole  and the segment does not fit our business model for the future 
we continue to assess strategic options for this segment 
financial condition at december   our net total assets were million 
we held million of inventory and million of property and equipment 
our cash totaled million and our receivables were million 
current liabilities were million  while our long term debt was million 
total stockholders equity at the end of had increased to million  primarily as a result of the million net income recorded in the increase in cash from to was due primarily to the increase in cash sales at tandy leather as opposed to sales on open account  as well as the decrease in cash tied up in inventory owned at the end of compared to while we have no required payment schedule prior to maturity on our revolving line of credit  management strives to apply as much available cash as possible to our outstanding debt balance 
generally speaking  the majority of cash on our balance sheet is funds held in depository accounts with various banks awaiting collectibility for transfer either to our operating account or to the line of credit 
at december   we held million of cash  million of inventory  accounts receivable of million  and million of property and equipment 
goodwill and other intangibles net of amortization and depreciation were  and  respectively 
we also own a leather artwork collection  most of which was created by al stohlman  a legendary leathercrafter  valued on our balance sheet at  net total assets were million

the current facility matures in october and is secured by our accounts receivable and inventory 
we opted to reduce the maximum amount that may be borrowed under this line of credit to million in order to reduce the fees required on the un borrowed portion of the line 
on november   we entered into a credit and security agreement with wells fargo bank  na  which replaced a line of credit with another bank affiliated with wells fargo 
the wells fargo current facility would have matured in november and was secured by all assets of the company 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions contained in the bank one credit agreement and have no reason to believe that we will not continue to operate in compliance with the provisions of these financing arrangements 
the principal terms and conditions of the credit agreement are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  notes payable and long term debt 
we borrow and repay funds under revolving credit terms as needed

the primary source of liquidity and capital resources during was cash flow provided by operating activities 
cash flow from operations for was million  the largest portion generated from net income 
cash flow from operations in was million  generated from net income and the reduction of inventory 
cash flow from operations in was million 
consolidated accounts receivable increased to million at december  compared to million at december  average days to collect accounts slowed slightly from days in to days in on a consolidated basis 
inventory increased from million at the end of to million at december  we expect our inventory to slowly trend upward as we continue our expansion of the tandy leather store chain 
however  we are pleased with our investment in inventory at the end of as it was within of our internal targets of optimum inventory levels 
we attempt to manage our inventory levels to avoid tying up excessive capital 
consolidated inventory turned times during  a slight improvement from the times turned in we compute our inventory turnover rates as sales divided by average inventory 
by operating division  inventory turns are as follows segment wholesale leathercraft retail leathercraft roberts  cushman wholesale leathercraft distribution centers only retail leathercraft inventory turns are significantly higher than that of the wholesale leathercraft because its inventory consists only of the inventory at the stores 
the tandy leather stores have no warehouse backstock inventory to include in the turnover computation as the stores get their product from the leather factory central warehouse 
leather factory s turns are expected to be slower because the central warehouse inventory supports the stores and distribution centers 
accounts payable increased to million at the end of compared to million at the end of due primarily to the increase in inventory purchases 
as discussed above  the largest use of operating cash in was for debt reduction and inventory purchases 
capital expenditures totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the capital expenditures consisted of fixtures and equipment for the new tandy leather retail stores  the remodel of the accounting offices located at our corporate complex  and miscellaneous computer and other equipment 
capital expenditures in occurred primarily due to the expansion of the tandy leather store chain and the construction of the stohlman leather museum and gallery located at our fort worth corporate complex 
also in  we made expenditures of  to purchase our primary canadian competitor as well as three us based independent leathercraft stores for conversion to tandy leather stores 
since we intend to continue opening or acquiring new tandy leather stores  expenditures related to this expansion should continue into we believe that cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations in  while also funding expansion and debt reduction 
at this time  management knows of no trends or demands  commitments events or uncertainties that will or are likely to materially affect our liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
in addition  we anticipate that this cash flow will enable us to meet the contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
however  if cash flows should decrease or uses of cash increase  we may defer debt reduction or increase our borrowings on our line of credit as needed 
we believe that  if desired  our present financial condition would permit us to increase the maximum amount that could be borrowed from lenders 
further  we could defer expansion plans if required by unanticipated drops in cash flow 
in particular  because of the relatively small investment required by each new tandy leather store  we have flexibility in when we make most expansion expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not had any off balance sheet arrangements during  and  and we do not currently have any such arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes by years our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  not including related interest expense payments due by periods contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations our loan from bank one matures in october the loan s maturity can be accelerated in the event of a material adverse change or upon other occurrences described in the related credit agreement 
these are our leased facilities 
in addition to the information shown in the table above  estimated annual interest to be paid on our line of credit with bank one would be approximately  per year  assuming an average interest rate of and there was no repayment of principal until maturity 
management expects to continue repaying principal as our cash flow allows and as a result  would expect the interest to be paid to be lower than the  estimate 
the interest rate on the capital lease is 
any imputed interest over the term of the lease would be insignificant 
summary of critical accounting policies management strives to report the financial results of the company in a clear and understandable manner  although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology 
we follow generally accepted accounting principles in the us in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
management continually reviews its accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements 
basis of consolidation 
we report our financial information on a consolidated basis 
therefore  unless there is an indication to the contrary  financial information is provided for the parent company  the leather factory  inc  and its subsidiaries as a whole 
transactions between the parent company and any subsidiaries are eliminated for this purpose 
we own all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries  and we do not have any subsidiaries that are not consolidated 
none of our subsidiaries are off balance sheet 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for retail over the counter sales as transactions occur and other sales upon shipment of our products provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations to the customer and collection is reasonably assured  which generally occurs upon shipment 
net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances  product returns  and allowances for defective merchandise 
allowance for accounts receivable 
we reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition  past collection history  and the aging of the account 
if the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment or inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is accounted for on the first in  first out method 
this means that sales of inventory treat the oldest item of identical inventory as being the first sold 
in addition  we periodically reduce the value of our inventory for slow moving or obsolete inventory 
this reduction is based on management s review of items on hand compared to their estimated future demand 
if actual future demand is less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be necessary 
goods shipped to us are recorded as inventory owned by us when the risk of loss shifts to us from the supplier 
goodwill 
we have indicated previously that a change in the accounting rules necessitated a change in in how we report goodwill on our balance sheet 
as a result  we incurred an impairment write down in of our investment in roberts  cushman in the amount of million 
the remaining goodwill on our balance sheet is analyzed by management periodically to determine the appropriateness of its carry value 
as of december   management determined that the present value of the discounted estimated future cash flows of the stores associated with the goodwill is sufficient to support their respective goodwill balances 
if actual results of these stores differ significantly from management s projections  such difference could affect the present value calculation in the future resulting in an impairment of all or part of the goodwill currently carried on our balance sheet 
forward looking statements item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report contain forward looking statements of management 
in general  these are predictions or suggestions of future events and statements or expectations of future occurrences 
there are certain important risks that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of the forward looking statements 
some  but not all  of the important risks which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements include  among other things we might fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the opening of tandy leather retail stores or we might be unable to obtain sufficient new locations on acceptable terms to meet our growth plans 
also  other retail initiatives might not be successful 
political considerations here and abroad could disrupt our sources of supplies from abroad or affect the prices we pay for goods 
continued involvement by the united states in war and other military operations in the middle east and other areas abroad could disrupt international trade and affect the company s inventory sources 
the recent slump in the economy in the united states  as well as abroad  may cause our sales to decrease or not to increase or adversely affect the prices charged for our products 
also  hostilities  terrorism or other events could worsen this condition 
as a result of the on going threat of terrorist attacks on the united states  consumer buying habits could change and decrease our sales 
livestock diseases such as mad cow could reduce the availability of hides and leathers or increase their cost 
also  the prices of hides and leathers fluctuate in normal times  and these fluctuations can affect the company 
if  for whatever reason  the costs of our raw materials and inventory increase  we may not be able to pass those costs on to our customers  particularly if the economy has not recovered from its downturn 
other factors could cause either fluctuations in buying patterns or possible negative trends in the craft and western retail markets 
in addition  our customers may change their preferences to products other than ours  or they may not accept new products as we introduce them 
tax or interest rates might increase 
in particular  interest rates are likely to increase at some point from their present low levels 
these increases will increase our costs of borrowing funds as needed in our business 
any change in the commercial banking environment may affect us and our ability to borrow capital as needed 
other uncertainties  which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company  may occur as well 
the company does not intend to update forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movement in foreign current exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material impact on our financial results 
we do not use or invest in market risk sensitive instruments to hedge any of these risks or for any other purpose 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our subsidiary in canada 
the leather factory of canada  ltd 
has local currency canadian dollar revenue and local currency operating expenses 
changes in the currency exchange rate impact the us dollar amount of revenue and expenses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  segment information  for financial information concerning our foreign activities 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements on outstanding debt 
our borrowings under the credit agreement with bank one accrue interest at a rate that changes with fluctuations in the prime rate 
based on our level of debt at march   an increase of one percent in the prime rate would result in additional interest expense of approximately  during a twelve month period
