regulatory matters usa 
the company is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air  discharges to waterways and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials and is also subject to other federal and state laws regarding health and safety matters 
the company believes it is presently in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are constantly evolving  and it is impossible to predict the effect these laws and regulations may have on the company in the future 
the environmental protection agency epa has issued certain regulations under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra dealing with the transportation  storage and treatment of hazardous waste that impact the 
table of contents company in its carbon reactivation services 
when activated carbon supplied to a customer can no longer adsorb contaminants  it is returned to the company s facilities for reactivation and subsequent reuse 
if the substance s adsorbed by the spent carbon is are considered hazardous  under these epa regulations the activated carbon used in the treatment process is also considered hazardous 
therefore  a permit is required to transport the hazardous carbon to the company s facility for reactivation 
the company possesses the necessary federal and state permits to transport hazardous waste 
at the company s reactivation site  the hazardous spent activated carbon is placed in temporary storage tanks 
under the epa regulations  the company is required to have a hazardous waste storage permit 
the company has obtained rcra part b permits to store hazardous waste at its pittsburgh and catlettsburg facilities 
the process of reactivating the spent activated carbon  which destroys the hazardous organic substances  is subject to permitting as a thermal treatment unit under rcra 
the company has filed for these permits at its pittsburgh and catlettsburg facilities and is working toward obtaining of the permits with the respective government agencies 
the company does not accept carbons containing certain hazardous materials for reactivation 
each of the company s domestic production facilities has permits and licenses regulating air emissions and water discharges 
all of the company s domestic production facilities are controlled under permits issued by local  state and federal air pollution control entities 
the company is presently in compliance with these permits 
continued compliance will require administrative control and will be subject to any new or additional standards 
in may  the company partially discontinued operation of one of its three activated carbon lines at its catlettsburg  kentucky facility 
the company will need to install pollution abatement equipment estimated at approximately million in order to remain in compliance with state requirements regulating air emissions before resuming full operation of this line 
management has not concluded its plan of action for compliance related to this activated carbon line  however  if it is determined that a shutdown of the full operation of the activated carbon line for other than a temporary period is warranted  the impact on current operating results would be insignificant 
in conjunction with the purchase of substantially all of waterlink s operating assets and the stock of waterlink s uk subsidiary  several environmental studies were performed on its columbus  ohio property by environmental consulting firms which identified and characterized areas of contamination 
in addition  these firms identified alternative methods of remediating the property  identified feasible alternatives and prepared cost evaluations of the cost of the various alternatives 
liability estimates are based on an evaluation of  among other factors  currently available facts  existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  and the remediation experience of other companies 
the company has concluded from the information in the studies that a loss at this property is probable and has included an estimate of such loss of million  which was recorded as an undiscounted liability on the opening balance sheet at the date of the acquisition and is presented as a component of noncurrent other liabilities in the company s december  consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   the company had an accrual of million recorded 
the change in the accrual is a result of a decrease in estimated costs of million  which reduced the acquisition price of wsp  and the environmental remediation expense incurred of million for the year ended december  it is reasonably possible that a change in the estimate of this obligation will occur as additional investigative work is performed and the remediation activity commences 
the ultimate remediation costs are dependent upon the extent and types of contamination  which may change as a result of more detailed information developed through upcoming investigations and experience gained through remediation activities 
the accrued amounts are expected to be paid out over the course of several years
