overview we develop  acquire and operate practice based ambulatory surgery centers in partnership with physician practice groups 
as of december   we owned a majority interest or greater in surgery centers 
the following table presents the changes in the number of surgery centers in operation  under development and under letter of intent for the years ended december   and a center is deemed to be under development when a limited partnership or limited liability company has been formed with the physician group partner to develop the center 
centers in operation  beginning of the year new center acquisitions placed in operation new development centers placed in operation centers disposed centers in operation  end of the year centers under development  end of the year development centers awaiting con approval  end of year average number of continuing centers in operation  during year centers under letter of intent  end of year in  we sold our interests in four centers 
in  we closed a center upon the expiration of its real estate lease 
this center operated in conjunction with a center that continues in operation and is owned by the same limited liability company 
of the surgery centers in operation as of december   centers perform gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures  centers perform ophthalmology surgery procedures  five centers perform orthopedic procedures and five centers perform procedures in more than one specialty 
the other partner or member in each limited partnership or limited liability company is generally an entity owned by physicians who perform procedures at the center 
we intend to expand primarily through the development and acquisition of additional practice based ambulatory surgery centers in targeted surgical specialties and through future same center growth 
our growth targets for include the acquisition or development of a net to additional surgery centers and the achievement of same center revenue growth of to 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued while we generally own of the entities that own the surgery centers  and up to in certain instances  our consolidated statements of operations include of the results of operations of the entities  reduced by the minority partners share of the net earnings or loss of the surgery center entities 
sources of revenues substantially all of our revenues are derived from facility fees charged for surgical procedures performed in our surgery centers 
this fee varies depending on the procedure  but usually includes all charges for operating room usage  special equipment usage  supplies  recovery room usage  nursing staff and medications 
facility fees do not include the charges of the patient s surgeon  anesthesiologist or other attending physicians  which are billed directly by the physicians 
our revenues are recorded net of estimated contractual adjustments from third party medical service payors 
practice based ambulatory surgery centers  such as those in which we own a majority interest  depend upon third party reimbursement programs  including governmental and private insurance programs  to pay for services rendered to patients 
the amount of payment a surgery center receives for its services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors  as well as other factors over which we have no control  including medicare and medicaid regulations and the cost containment and utilization decisions of third party payors 
we derived approximately  and of our revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively  from governmental healthcare programs  primarily medicare 
the medicare program currently pays ambulatory surgery centers in accordance with predetermined fee schedules 
on october  and october   our surgery centers received a and price increase  respectively  from medicare 
however  effective april   our surgery centers received a price decrease from medicare 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
principles of consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of amsurg and our subsidiaries and the majority owned limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which our wholly owned subsidiaries are the general partner or majority member 
consolidation of such limited partnerships and limited liability companies is necessary  as our wholly owned subsidiaries have or more of the financial interest  are the general partner or majority member with all the duties  rights and responsibilities thereof and are responsible for the day to day management of the limited partnership or limited liability companies  and have control of the entities 
the responsibilities of our minority partners are to supervise the delivery of medical services  with their rights being restricted to those that protect their financial interests  such as approval of the acquisition of significant assets or the incurrence of debt which they are required to guarantee on a pro rata basis based upon their respective ownership interests 
intercompany profits  transactions and balances have been eliminated 
surgery center profits are allocated to our minority partners in proportion to their individual ownership percentages and reflected in the aggregate as minority interest 
the minority partners of our surgery center limited partnerships and limited liability companies typically are organized as general partnerships  limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are not subject to federal income tax 
each minority partner shares in the pre tax earnings of the surgery center in which it holds minority ownership 
accordingly  the minority interest in each of our limited partnerships and limited liability companies is determined on a pre tax basis and presented before earnings before income taxes in order to present that amount of earnings on which we must determine our tax expense 
in addition  distributions from our limited partnerships and limited liability companies are made to both our subsidiary general partners and majority members and our minority partners on a pre tax basis 
as described above  we are a holding company and our ability to service corporate debt is dependent upon distributions from our limited partnerships and limited liability companies 
positive operating cash flows of 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued individual centers are the sole source of cash used to make distributions to our subsidiary general partners and majority members as well as to our minority partners  which we are obligated to make on a monthly basis in accordance with each limited partnership s and limited liability company s partnership or operating agreement 
accordingly  distributions to our minority partners are included in our financial statements as a component of our cash flows from operating activities 
we operate in one reportable business segment  the ownership and operation of ambulatory surgery centers 
revenue recognition 
center revenues consist of billing for the use of the centers facilities  or facility fees  directly to the patient or third party payor  and in limited instances  billing for anesthesia services 
such revenues are recognized when the related surgical procedures are performed 
revenues exclude any amounts billed for physicians surgical services  which are billed separately by the physicians to the patient or third party payor 
allowance for contractual adjustments and bad debt expense 
our revenues are recorded net of estimated contractual adjustments from third party medical service payors  which we estimate based on historical trends of the surgery centers cash collections and contractual write offs  accounts receivable agings  established fee schedules  contracts with payors and procedure statistics 
in addition  we must estimate allowances for bad debt expense using similar information and analysis 
these estimates are recorded and monitored monthly for each of our surgery centers as additional revenue is recognized 
our ability to accurately estimate contractual adjustments is dependent upon and supported by the fact that our surgery centers perform and bill for limited types of procedures  that the range of reimbursement for those procedures within each surgery center specialty is very narrow and that payments are typically received within to days of billing 
in addition  our surgery centers are not required to file cost reports  and therefore  we have no risk of unsettled amounts from third party payors 
these estimates are not  however  established from billing system generated contractual adjustments based on fee schedules for the patient s insurance plan for each patient encounter 
while we believe that our allowances for contractual adjustments and bad debt expense are adequate  if the actual contractual adjustments and write offs are in excess of our estimates  our results of operations may be overstated 
during the years ended december   and  we had no significant adjustments to our allowances for contractual adjustments and bad debt expense related to prior periods 
at december  and  net accounts receivable reflected allowances for contractual adjustments of million and million  respectively  and allowances for bad debt expense of million and million  respectively 
at december  and  we had and days outstanding reflected in our gross accounts receivable 
purchase price allocation 
we allocate the respective purchase price of our acquisitions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 business combinations 
the allocation of purchase price involves first  determining the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
secondly  the excess amount of purchase price is to be allocated to unidentifiable intangible assets goodwill 
a significant portion of each surgery center s purchase price historically has been allocated to goodwill due to the nature of the businesses acquired  the pricing and structure of our acquisitions and the absence of other factors indicating any significant value which could be attributable to separately identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill 
we apply the provision of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which requires that goodwill be evaluated for impairment at least on an annual basis  impairment of carrying value will be evaluated more frequently if certain indicators are encountered 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested at the reporting unit level  defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component  with the fair value of the reporting unit being compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired 
we have determined that we have one operating as well as one reportable segment 
our centers each qualify as components of that operating segment and have similar economic characteristics  and therefore  should be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit 
we completed our annual impairment test as required by sfas as of december   and have determined that it is not necessary to recognize impairment in our goodwill 
results of operations our revenues are directly related to the number of procedures our surgery centers perform 
our overall growth in procedure volume is impacted directly by the increase in the number of surgery centers in operation and the growth in procedure volume at existing centers 
we increase our number of surgery centers through both acquisitions and 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued developments 
procedure growth at any existing center may result from additional contracts entered into with third party payors  increased market share of the associated medical practice of our physician partners  new physician partners and or scheduling and operating efficiencies gained at the surgery center 
a significant measurement of how much our revenues grow from year to year for existing centers is our same center revenue percentage 
we define our same center group each year as those centers which contain full year to date operations in both comparable reporting periods 
in  we had centers in our same center group and they had revenue growth of 
while historically our quarter to quarter and year to year same center revenue percentages have varied from to  we believe that our same center revenues in will range between and 
our same center group in will be comprised of centers  which constitutes approximately of our total base of centers 
during  revenue for of our centers was adversely impacted by four major hurricanes in the florida region during the months of august and september 
hurricane preparations and evacuations resulted in business disruption as scheduled surgical procedures were postponed or canceled 
while experiencing no significant property damage  normal operations of these centers continued to be disrupted following landfall of the hurricanes due to power outages and dislocated patients  doctors and surgery center employees 
we estimate that as a result of the hurricanes  revenues were reduced by million in and our same center revenue growth was adversely affected by approximately 
expenses directly related to procedures performed at our surgery centers include clinical and administrative salaries and benefits  supply cost and other variable expenses such as linen cost  repair and maintenance of equipment  billing fees and bad debt expense 
the majority of our corporate salary and benefits cost is associated directly with the number of centers we own and manage and tends to grow in proportion to the growth of our centers in operation 
our centers and corporate offices also incur costs that are more fixed in nature  such as lease expense  legal fees  property taxes  utilities and depreciation and amortization 
surgery center profits are allocated to our minority partners in proportion to their individual ownership percentages and reflected in the aggregate as minority interest 
the minority partners of our surgery center limited partnerships and limited liability companies typically are organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are not subject to federal income tax 
each minority partner shares in the pre tax earnings of the surgery center of which it is a minority partner 
accordingly  the minority interest in each of our surgery center limited partnerships and limited liability companies is determined on a pre tax basis and presented before earnings before income taxes in order to present that amount of earnings on which we must determine our tax expense 
our interest expense results primarily from our borrowings used to fund acquisition and development activity  as well as interest incurred on capital leases 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return and numerous state income tax returns with varying tax rates 
our income tax expense reflects the blending of these rates 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following table shows certain statement of earnings items expressed as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and revenues operating expenses salaries and benefits supply cost other operating expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income minority interest interest expense  net of interest income earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense net earnings from continuing operations discontinued operations earnings from operations of discontinued interests in surgery centers  net of income taxes gain on sale of discontinued interests in surgery centers  net of income taxes earnings from discontinued operations net earnings year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the additional revenue resulted primarily from centers acquired and developed in  which contributed million additional revenue due to having a full year of operations in  acquired and developed centers in  which had million in revenue  and million  or  revenue growth recognized by centers in our same center group 
the additional revenue from our same center group resulted primarily from procedure growth and was negatively impacted by approximately due to the hurricanes described above 
the additional surgery centers in operation and same center procedure growth resulted in a increase in procedure volume in over staff at newly acquired and developed centers  as well as the additional staffing required at existing centers due to increased volume  resulted in a increase in salaries and benefits at our surgery centers 
in order to provide appropriate corporate management for the additional centers  we increased our number of corporate employees 
however  because certain financial targets were not met  the company did not pay as high of levels of incentive compensation for compared to as a result  we experienced no significant changes in our corporate salary and benefit expense 
salaries and benefits increased in total by to million in from million in supply cost was million in  an increase of million  or  over supply cost in this increase was commensurate with the additional procedure volume and reflective of a consistent of revenues in and our average supply cost per procedure in and was 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from the additional expense resulted primarily from centers acquired and developed in  with an increase of million in additional operating expenses due to having a full year of operations in  acquired and developed centers in  with million in other operating expenses  and million increase in other operating expenses from our same center group resulting from cost of additional revenue 
this increase was commensurate with the additional procedure volume 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in a significant factor which contributed to this decrease was a reduction of bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues from to due to our concentrated efforts to improve our cash collection processes 
in addition  we had certain cost reductions in medical malpractice insurance  primarily as a result of more favorable loss history  and repair and maintenance compared to on a per center basis 
included in other operating expenses in is a non cash loss on a long term note receivable of million in due to our establishment of a reserve for our estimate of the uncollectible portion of a long term note receivable 
the note receivable originated from the sale of a physician practice in in connection with our exit from that line of business 
we expect other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in future periods to return to a level more consistent with historical periods 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  in from  primarily as a result of the newly developed surgery centers in operation which have an initially higher level of depreciation expense due to the brand new construction cost 
we anticipate further increases in operating expenses in  primarily due to additional start up centers and acquired centers expected to be placed in operation 
typically  a start up center will incur start up losses while under development and during its initial months of operations and will experience lower revenues and operating margins than an established center until its case load grows to a more optimal operating level  which generally is expected to occur within the months after a center opens 
at december   we had nine centers under development and six centers that had been open for less than one year 
minority interest in earnings in increased million  or  from  primarily as a result of minority partners interest in earnings at surgery centers recently added to operations 
as a percentage of revenues  minority interest remained unchanged at in  compared to in interest expense increased approximately  in  or  from  primarily due to additional long term debt outstanding during resulting primarily from acquisition activity and our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources 
we recognized income tax expense from continuing operations of million in compared to million in our effective tax rate in and was and  respectively  of earnings before income taxes and differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of  primarily due to the impact of state income taxes 
during  we anticipate that our effective tax rate will continue to decrease to a range of approximately to due to lower weighted average state tax rates anticipated to be applied in because we deduct goodwill amortization for tax purposes only  a larger portion of our overall income tax expense is considered deferred income taxes  which results in a continuing increase in our deferred tax liability  which would only be due in part or in whole upon the disposition of a portion or all of our surgery centers 
in three separate transactions in  we sold our interests in four surgery centers and recognized a combined after tax gain of million 
the centers results of operations have been classified as discontinued operations and prior periods have been restated 
the net earnings derived from the operations of these centers were million and million in and year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the additional revenue resulted primarily from centers acquired and developed in  which contributed million additional revenue due to having a full year of operations in  acquired and developed centers in  which had million in revenue  and million  or  revenue growth recognized by centers in our same center group as a result of procedure growth 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the additional surgery centers in operation and same center procedure growth resulted in a increase in procedure volume in over staff at newly acquired and developed centers  as well as the additional staffing required at existing centers due to increased volume  resulted in a increase in salaries and benefits at our surgery centers 
our salaries and benefits at our corporate offices remained flat 
however  because certain financial targets were not met  the company did not pay as high of levels of incentive compensation for compared to as a result  we experienced no significant changes in our corporate salary and benefit expense 
salaries and benefits increased in total by to million in from million in supply cost was million in  an increase of million  or  over supply cost in this increase was commensurate with the additional procedure volume 
our average supply cost per procedure in and was other operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from the additional expense resulted primarily from centers acquired and developed in  with an increase of million in additional operating expenses due to having a full year of operations in  acquired and developed centers in  with million in other operating expenses  and million increase in other operating expenses from our same center group resulting from cost of additional revenue 
this increase was commensurate with the additional procedure volume 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  in from  primarily as a result of the additional surgery centers in operation 
operating income margin increased by  which is primarily the result of the leverage we achieve from having a high but consistent fixed cost component from year to year at each center 
because each incremental procedure generates only a variable cost component  same center procedure growth generally contributes to operating income at a rate higher than the average operating income margin of the center 
minority interest in earnings in increased million  or  from  primarily as a result of minority partners interest in earnings at surgery centers recently added to operations and from increased same center profitability 
as a percentage of revenues  minority interest increased due to the fact that all of the acquired and developed centers in have a minority ownership  which continues to dilute the impact on minority interest of those centers that have less than minority ownership 
interest expense increased approximately  in  or  from  primarily due to additional long term debt outstanding during resulting primarily from acquisition activity and our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources 
we recognized income tax expense of million in compared to million in our effective tax rate in and was of earnings before income taxes and differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of  primarily due to the impact of state income taxes 
because we deduct goodwill amortization for tax purposes only  a larger portion of our overall income tax expense is considered deferred income taxes  which results in a continuing increase in our deferred tax liability  which would only be due in part or in whole upon the disposition of a portion or all of our surgery centers 
in three separate transactions in  we sold our interests in four surgery centers 
the centers results of operations have been classified as discontinued operations and prior periods have been restated 
the net earnings derived from the operations of these centers were million and million in and liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of million compared to million at december  operating activities for generated million in cash flow from operations compared to million in the increase in operating cash flow activity resulted primarily from an additional million in net earnings from continuing operations  resulting primarily from additional centers in operation and growth in same center revenue 
operating cash flow in and contained million and million  respectively  in tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
cash and cash equivalents at december  and were million and million  respectively 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the principle source of our operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from governmental payors  commercial payors and individuals 
each of our surgery centers bills for services as delivered  either electronically or in paper form  usually within several days following the delivery of the procedure 
generally  unpaid amounts that are days past due are rebilled based on a standard set of procedures 
if amounts remain uncollected after days  our surgery centers proceed with a series of late notice notifications until amounts are either collected  contractually written off in accordance with contracted rates or determined to be uncollectible  typically after to days 
receivables determined to be uncollectible are written off and such amounts are applied to our estimate of allowance for bad debts as previously established in accordance with our policy for allowance for bad debt expense see critical accounting policies allowance for contractual adjustments and bad debt expense 
the amount of actual write offs of account balances for each of our surgery centers is continuously compared to established allowances for bad debt to ensure that such allowances are adequate 
at december  and  our accounts receivable represented and days revenue outstanding  respectively 
during  we had total capital expenditures of million  which included million for acquisitions of interests in practice based ambulatory surgery centers  including million in notes payable  which were repaid in  million for new or replacement property at existing surgery centers including  in new capital leases  and million for new start up surgery centers 
our cash flow from operations was enough to fund over of our acquisition cash obligations and development activity  and we received approximately million from capital contributions of our minority partners to fund their proportionate share of development activity 
borrowings under long term debt were used to fund the remaining portion of our acquisition cash obligations and development activity 
at december   we and our limited partnerships and limited liability companies had unfunded construction and equipment purchase commitments for centers under development or under renovation of approximately million  which we intend to fund through additional borrowings of long term debt  operating cash flow and capital contributions by minority partners 
in  we received approximately million in cash proceeds from the sale of our interests in three surgery centers 
we also sold our interest in an additional surgery center for million in the form of a secured note receivable 
the note is secured by a pledge of a ownership interest in the center  is guaranteed by the physician partners at the center and is due in installments through the balance of this note and our other notes receivable at december  was million 
during  we had net borrowings on long term debt of million 
at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  which permits us to borrow up to million to finance our acquisition and development projects and stock repurchase program at a rate equal to  at our option  the prime rate plus a spread of to or libor plus a spread of to  depending upon borrowing levels 
the loan agreement also provides for a fee of to of unused commitments 
the loan agreement prohibits the payment of dividends and contains covenants relating to the ratio of debt to net worth  operating performance and minimum net worth 
we were in compliance in all material respects with all covenants at december  borrowings under the credit facility are due in march and are secured primarily by a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries that serve as the general partners of our limited partnerships and our membership interests in the limited liability companies 
we incurred approximately  in deferred financing fees during  primarily associated with amending our credit facility 
during  we received approximately million from the exercise of options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock option plans 
the tax benefit received from the exercise of those options was approximately million 
in  we completed our authorized stock repurchase programs  which were authorized in february and march  by acquiring and retiring  shares of our common stock for million  at an average price per share of 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in february  our board of directors approved a for stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend 
the new shares were distributed on march  to shareholders of record at the close of business on march  effective may   our second amended and restated charter was amended to increase our authorized shares of capital stock from  to  and to increase our authorized shares of common stock  no par value  from  to  the following schedule summarizes all of our contractual obligations by period as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases  including renewal option periods construction in progress commitments total contractual cash obligations our long term debt may increase based on acquisition activity expected to occur in the future 
we may use our operating cash flow to repay existing long term debt under our credit facility prior to its maturity date 
in addition  as of december   we had available under our revolving credit facility million for acquisition borrowings 
our credit facility matures on march  foregoing any significant adverse impact on our future operating results  we believe that our operating cash flow and borrowing capacity will provide us with adequate liquidity for the next three to five years to conduct our business and further implement our growth strategy 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no  or fin  revised  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation  which replaces fin  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities when certain characteristics are present 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after december   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
interests held in variable interest entities created on or before december  are not subject to the provisions of this interpretation until the end of the first reporting period after march  unless the variable interest entities meet the definition of a special purpose entity as defined by this statement 
this interpretation must be applied for special purpose entities as of the first reporting period subsequent to december  and for all other types of entities for periods ending after march  as of december   we did not have any entities that are considered to be variable interest entities 
the adoption of the remaining portion of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment revised 
this statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for the company s equity instruments or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity securities or may be settled by the issuance of these securities 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation using accounting principles board opinion no 
and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value method 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued statements issued for fiscal periods beginning after june  and will become effective for us beginning with the third quarter of we have yet to determine a transition method to adopt sfas r or which valuation method to use 
the full impact that the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position and results of operations will be determined by share based payments granted in future periods  the transition method and valuation model used 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing and cash management activities 
we utilize a balanced mix of maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates 
our debt instruments are primarily indexed to the prime rate or libor 
although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly  we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in the table below provides information as of december  and about our long term debt obligations based on maturity dates that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands  except percentage data fair value at years ended december  december  thereafter total fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate fair value at years ended december  december  thereafter total fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate the difference in maturities of long term obligations and overall increase in total borrowings principally resulted from our borrowings associated with our stock repurchase programs and acquisitions of surgery centers 
the average interest rates on these borrowings at december  increased as compared to december  due to an overall increase in market rates
