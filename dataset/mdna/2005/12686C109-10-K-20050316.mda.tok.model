we disclaim any obligation to update or revise the forward looking statements contained herein  except as otherwise required by applicable federal securities laws 
cablevision systems corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary our future performance is dependent  to a large extent  on general economic conditions including capital market characteristics  the effectiveness of direct competition  our ability to manage our businesses effectively  and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace  both with suppliers and customers 
telecommunications in our telecommunications segment we derive revenues principally through monthly payments by subscribers to our video  high speed data and voice services 
these monthly payments include charges for cable television programming  as well as  in many cases  equipment rental  pay per view and video on demand charges  high speed data and payments for voip services 
revenue increases are derived from increases in the number of subscribers to these services  upgrades by video customers in the level of programming package to which they subscribe and additional services sold to our existing subscribers 
we also derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available to cable television systems 
revenues from advertising vary based upon the number and demographics of our subscribers who view the programming carried on our cable television systems 
by far the most serious challenge we face in our provision of cable television video services  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues in  comes from competition from the direct broadcast satellite business 
there are two major providers of dbs service in the united states  each with significantly higher numbers of subscribers than we have 
we intend to compete with these dbs competitors by bundling our service offerings with products that the dbs companies cannot efficiently provide at this time  such as high speed data service and voip service carried over the cable distribution plant  as well as by providing on demand services that are currently unavailable to a dbs subscriber 
our high speed data services business  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues in  faces competition from dsl providers 
these providers have become increasingly aggressive in their pricing strategies in recent years  and customers may decide that a reduced price is more important to them than the superior speed that cable modems provide 
in addition  with of our basic subscribers now subscribing to our high speed data service  opportunities to expand that base at the current pace may be limited 
the recent gains in cable modem penetration may therefore not be indicative of the results we achieve in the future 
our consumer voip offering is competitive with incumbent offerings primarily on the basis of pricing  where unlimited united states and canada long distance  regional and local calling  together with certain features for which the incumbent providers charge extra  are offered at one low price 
to the extent the incumbents  who have financial resources that exceed those of the company  decide to meet our pricing and or features or reduce their pricing  future growth and success of this business may be impaired 
the regulatory framework for cable modem service and voip service is being developed and differing regulatory alternatives will be considered  including increased regulation  which may affect our competitive position 
lightpath  our commercial telephone and broadband business  operates in the most competitive business telecommunications market in the country and competes against the very largest telecommunications companies both incumbent local exchange companies  other competitive local exchange companies and long distance companies 
to the extent that dominant market leaders decide to reduce their prices  future success of the company may be impaired 
the trend in business communications has been shifting from a wired voice medium to a wireless  data medium 
should this trend accelerate dramatically  future growth of lightpath may be impaired 
in addition  the telephone companies may find technological or other solutions to upgrade their service offering  providing additional competition for our video  data and voice service offerings 
rainbow in our rainbow segment  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues  we earn revenues in two principal ways 
first  we receive affiliate fee payments from operators of cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite operators 
these revenues are earned under multi year affiliation agreements with those companies 
the specific affiliate fees we earn vary from operator to operator and also vary among our networks 
the second principal source of revenues in this segment is from advertising 
under our agreements with cable and satellite operators we have the right to sell a specific amount of advertising time on our programs 
our advertising revenues are more variable than affiliate fees 
this is because most of our advertising is sold on a short term basis  not under long term contracts 
also our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming as measured by rating services 
we seek to grow our revenues in the rainbow segment by increasing the number of cable systems and satellite providers that carry our services and the number of subscribers to cable systems and satellite services that receive our programming 
we refer to this as our penetration 
amc  which is widely distributed  has less ability to increase its penetration than newer  less penetrated services 
we may be subject to requests by distributors to make upfront payments in exchange for these additional subscribers or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided 
we also may help fund the distributors efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees 
as we continue our efforts to add subscribers  our subscriber revenue may be negatively affected by subscriber acquisition fee expenses  discounted subscriber fees and other payments  however  we believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract period 
we seek to increase our advertising revenues through intensified marketing and by airing an increased number of minutes of national advertising but  ultimately  the level of our advertising revenues are directly related to the penetration of our services and the popularity including within desirable demographic groups of our services as measured by rating services 
the principal goals in this segment are to increase our affiliation fee revenues and our advertising revenues by increasing penetration of our national services 
to do this we must continue to contract for and produce high quality  attractive programming 
our greatest challenge arises from the increasing concentration of subscribers in the hands of a few cable television operators and satellite providers 
this increased concentration increases the power of those operators and providers and could adversely affect our ability to increase the penetration of our services or even result in decreased penetration 
in addition  this concentration gives those distributors greater leverage in negotiating the pricing and other terms of affiliation agreements 
moreover  as a result of this concentration the potential impact of a loss of any one of our major affiliate relationships would be more significant 
in december  regional programming partners completed the acquisition of the interests in fox sports net bay area and fox sports net chicago that it did not already own in a transaction that was accounted for as a purchase 
as a result  as of december   we began consolidating the results of fox sports net bay area and fox sports net chicago 
the consolidation increased the revenues and expenses in our rainbow segment in  although the amount of revenues that the rainbow segment will receive from fox sports net chicago will decline in future periods as a result of the termination by two of its significant customers that declined to carry fox sports net chicago without these distribution rights agreements 
in february  the company announced it was restructuring its regional programming partnership with various subsidiaries of news corporation 
upon closing of the transaction  the company will own of madison square garden and will no longer own interests in fox sports ohio  fox sports florida  national sports partners or national advertising partners 
the company will also own of fox sports net chicago as well as of fox sports net new england 
in addition  the million promissory notes payable to news corporation will be contributed by news corporation to regional programming partnership for no additional consideration and will thereafter be cancelled without any payment being made on them 
as a result  the company will no longer consolidate the operating results or the assets and liabilities of fox sports net ohio and fox sports net florida 
the net revenues and operating income of fox sports net ohio and fox sports net florida for the year ended december  aggregated approximately million and million  respectively 
the operating results of these businesses include certain allocations of general and administrative costs from the company that may not be eliminated upon the sale of these businesses and certain other intercompany related transactions which currently eliminate in our consolidated financial statements 
the pro forma effects of this transaction will be reported in the period that the transaction is consummated 
the amount of cash on hand at fox sports net ohio and fox sports net florida as of december  totaled million and these entities had no indebtedness 
upon closing of the transaction  fox sports net ohio and fox sports net florida will be transferred with their respective cash on hand and such cash will no longer be consolidated on our balance sheet 
madison square garden madison square garden  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues  consists of professional sports teams principally the new york knicks of the nba and the new york rangers of the nhl and the new york liberty of the womens national basketball association  the msg networks sports programming business  and an entertainment business  which operates the madison square garden arena  radio city music hall  the hartford civic center and rentschler field entertainment venues  and faces competitive challenges unique to these activities 
we derive revenues in this segment primarily from the sale of tickets  including luxury box rentals  to sporting and entertainment events  from rental rights fees paid to this segment by promoters that present events at our entertainment venues and the sports teams share of league wide distributions of national television rights fees and royalties 
we also derive revenue from the sale of advertising at the entertainment venues  from food  beverage and merchandise sales at the venues and from the licensing of our trademarks 
msg networks derives its revenues from affiliate fees paid by cable television and satellite providers  sales of advertising  and from rights fees paid to this segment by broadcasters and programming services that telecast events of sports teams which are under contract with msg networks 
msg networks carries knicks and ranger games  so that  like the rest of this segment  its performance is related to the performance of the teams 
all of these revenues are ultimately dependent upon the quality of our sporting and entertainment events 
madison square garden s short term agreement with an affiliate expired on march  and this affiliate has discontinued carriage of madison square garden s networks 
we believe we will ultimately reach contractual terms with this affiliate for carriage of msg networks 
however  we can give no assurance as to when an agreement will be reached and therefore cannot determine the extent to which our operating results will be negatively impacted 
if an agreement is not reached in  the negative impact to madison square garden s operating results could be significant  but the impact would not be material to the company s consolidated operating results 
our sports teams financial success is dependent on their ability to generate advertising sales  paid attendance  luxury box rentals  and food  beverage and merchandise sales 
to a large extent  the ability of the team to build excitement among fans and therefore produce higher revenue streams  depends on the teams winning performance  which generates regular season and playoff attendance  and which supports increases in prices charged for tickets  luxury box rentals  and advertising placement 
each team s success is dependent on its ability to acquire highly competitive personnel 
the governing bodies of the nba and the nhl have the power and authority to take certain actions that they deem to be in the best interest of their respective leagues  which may not necessarily be consistent with maximizing this segment s results of operations 
effective september  the national hockey league nhl commenced a lockout of the players in support of its attempt to reach a new collective bargaining agreement with the national hockey league players association 
the parties failed to reach an agreement after several negotiating sessions and on february   the nhl announced that it had cancelled the season 
we can give no assurance as to when the labor dispute will be resolved and therefore can not determine the extent to which our operating results will be negatively impacted 
however  while a continued lockout could have a significant adverse impact on madison square garden s operating results  we do not believe it would have a significant adverse impact on the company s consolidated operating results 
the success of our msg networks sports programming business is affected by our ability to secure desired programming of a variety of professional sports teams in addition to our proprietary programming 
the continued carriage and success of the teams that are telecast by us will impact our revenues from distribution and from the rates charged for affiliation and advertising 
in the second quarter of  the new york mets gave notice of termination of their broadcast rights agreement with madison square garden 
the termination of the rights agreement will be effective after the baseball season 
our entertainment business is largely dependent on the continued success of our radio city christmas spectacular and our touring christmas shows  as well as availability of  and our venues ability to attract  concerts  family shows and events 
rainbow dbs rainbow dbs launched its voom sm service on october  the rainbow dbs segment had not produced any revenues and incurred operating expenses of million during for the year ended december   rainbow dbs net revenues amounted to million and operating losses amounted to million  including impairment charges of million 
in january  the company s board of directors authorized and directed the sale of the assets of rainbow dbs and the shutdown of its business 
on january   rainbow dbs entered into a definitive agreement to sell its rainbow direct broadcast satellite and certain other related assets to a subsidiary of echostar communications corp 
for million in cash 
this transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals 
in february  the company announced that it had signed a letter of intent under which voom hd  llc  a new private company formed by certain holders of cablevision class b common stock  including charles f 
dolan and thomas c 
dolan  would acquire from the company the business  assets and liabilities of the company s rainbow dbs satellite business not included in the above mentioned agreement with echostar 
the letter of intent between the company and voom hd expired on february  without a definitive agreement being reached 
following the expiration of the letter of intent  the company began shutting down the rainbow dbs operations 
in march  the company entered into an agreement with charles f 
dolan and thomas c 
dolan march agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to work cooperatively to finalize the separation of rainbow dbs from the company 
cablevision has agreed that no new shutdown activities will be undertaken at rainbow dbs during the term of this agreement 
charles f 
dolan has agreed to fund any rainbow dbs expenditures above those that would have been incurred under a shutdown scenario 
charles f 
dolan is required to fund those expenditures by providing to the company cash or shares of the company s common stock in advance of the company making any expenditures above those contemplated in the shutdown budget 
similarly  if rainbow dbs makes any new commitments or other agreements  the company will segregate cash or shares received from charles f 
dolan to pay the costs associated with those actions 
in march  charles f 
dolan deposited million with the company in accordance with the march agreement 
the march agreement between the company and charles and thomas dolan terminates on march  charles f 
dolan has the right to terminate the agreement before that date 
upon any termination  any cash or shares deposited by charles f 
dolan that have not been used to fund costs or segregated to pay costs associated with new commitments or other agreements will be returned to him and the shutdown of rainbow dbs will be implemented immediately 
in the event of a shutdown  the company anticipates incurring significant costs relating to early termination of various contracts  other contractual obligations  employee termination benefits and other costs 
critical accounting policies in preparing its financial statements  the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following impairment of long lived and indefinite lived assets the company s long lived assets at december  include excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill of approximately billion  approximately billion of other intangible assets and approximately billion of property  plant and equipment 
such assets accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated total assets 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and was required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
statement requires that goodwill impairment be determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination 
the impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for other long lived assets  including intangibles that are amortized  the company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indicator of potential impairment 
if the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets  the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other long lived assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions 
these valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  discount rate  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
for the telecommunications services segment  these valuations also include assumptions for average annual revenue per customer  number of homes passed  operating margin and market penetration as a percentage of homes passed  among other assumptions 
for the madison square garden msg and rainbow segments these valuations also include assumptions for projected average rates per basic and viewing subscribers  number of events msg segment only  access to sports programming and film rights and the cost of such programming and film rights  amount of programming time that is advertiser supported  number of advertising spots available and the sell out rates for those spots  average fee per advertising spot  and operating margins  among other assumptions 
if these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges related to our long lived assets 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of the company s reporting units on the impairment calculation for indefinite lived intangibles  the company applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
this hypothetical decrease would have no impact on the impairment analysis for any of the company s reporting units 
rights to feature film inventory acquired under license agreements along with the related obligations are recorded at the contract value when a license agreement is executed or the license period has begun 
costs are amortized to technical and operating expense on the straight line basis over the respective license periods 
we periodically review the programming usefulness of our feature film inventory based on a series of factors  including ratings  type and quality of program material  standards and practices  and fitness for exhibition based on the programming of the individual programming service 
if we determine that substantially all of the films in a film license agreement have no future programming usefulness and will no longer be exploited  we would record a write off for the portion of the unamortized cost of the film license agreement that was attributed to those films 
in  the company recorded impairment losses totaling approximately million related to its decision to seek strategic alternatives for the rainbow dbs segment of its operations 
that amount includes approximately million that was included in technical and operating expenses representing million for the write down of certain film and programming contracts and million for the write off of equipment inventory and deposits 
the remaining million of the direct broadcast satellite impairment loss is included in depreciation and amortization and includes million of impairments of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
in addition to the rainbow dbs impairment losses  we recorded impairment losses of million  million and million in the year ended december   and  respectively  included in technical and operating expense  representing the impairment of certain film and programming contracts 
the company also recorded an impairment loss in of million representing the write down of software and leasehold improvements relating to the company s retail electronics business now reported in discontinued operations 
useful lives of finite lived intangibles assets the company has recognized intangible assets for affiliation agreements and advertiser relationships as a result of the july repurchase of mgm s interest in each of amc  we and ifc and the repurchase of nbc s interests in rainbow media holdings in various transactions in and the company has determined that such intangible assets have finite lives and has estimated those lives to be years for affiliation agreements and to years for advertiser relationships 
at december   the carrying values  net of accumulated amortization  were million for affiliation agreements and million for advertiser relationships 
the amount we originally allocated in purchase accounting to the affiliation agreements finite lived intangibles in our consolidated financial statements is the estimated aggregate fair value of those affiliation agreements and the related customer relationships 
the useful lives for the affiliation agreements were determined based upon an analysis of the weighted average lives of existing agreements the company had in place with its major customers at the time that purchase accounting was applied  plus an estimate for renewals of such agreements 
the company has been successful in renewing its affiliation agreements and maintaining customer relationships in the past and believes it will be able to renew its major affiliation agreements and maintain those customer relationships in the future 
however  it is possible that the company will not successfully renew such agreements as they expire or that if it does  the net revenue earned may not equal or exceed the net revenue currently being earned  which could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
in light of these facts and circumstances  the company has determined that an estimated useful life of to years is appropriate depending on the nature of the underlying intangible 
there have been periods when an existing affiliation agreement has expired and the parties have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time 
in substantially all these instances  the affiliates continued to carry and pay for the service under oral or written interim agreements until execution of definitive replacement agreements or renewal 
in one case during  there was a day period in which an affiliate was restricted from carrying certain of the company s sports and entertainment networks because the parties had not reached agreement on contract renewal terms 
we reached a short term agreement with the affiliate at the end of the day period and that affiliate continuously carried the networks pursuant to successive subsequent short term agreements through march  however  we were unable to reach an agreement with this affiliate at expiration on march   and this affiliate has discontinued carriage of certain of the company s sports networks 
we believe we will ultimately reach contractual terms with this affiliate for carriage of such networks 
however  if we are not successful in reaching such agreement in the future  we may be required to recognize an impairment of the related affiliate and customer relationship intangibles associated with this affiliate 
see impairment of long lived and indefinite lived assets above 
if an affiliate were to cease carrying the service on an other than temporary basis  the company would record an impairment charge for the then remaining carrying value of that affiliation agreement 
if the company were to renew an affiliation agreement at rates that produced materially less net revenue compared to the net revenue produced under the previous agreement  the company would evaluate the impact on its cash flows and  if necessary  would further evaluate such indication of potential impairment by following the policy described above under impairment of long lived and indefinite lived assets for the asset group containing that intangible 
the company also would evaluate whether the remaining useful life of the affiliation agreement remained appropriate 
based on december  carrying values  if the estimated life of all affiliation agreements were shortened by  the effect on amortization in the year ending december  would be to increase our annual amortization expense by approximately million 
valuation of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the company s future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of its net operating loss carry forwards and deductible temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
if such estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
in  the income tax benefit of the company reflects an increase in the valuation allowance of million 
at the end of the second quarter of  nbc exchanged part of its interest in rainbow media holdings for shares of the company s common stock 
as a result of this exchange  rainbow media holdings became a member of the consolidated federal income tax return of the company 
the exchange was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the valuation allowance was reduced to zero  resulting in a reduction to the recorded goodwill  without any income statement benefit 
in and  the company recorded increases in the valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards 
plant and equipment costs incurred in the construction of the company s cable television system  including line extensions to  and rebuild of  the company s hybrid fiber coaxial infrastructure and costs incurred in the construction of the company s headend facilities are capitalized 
these costs consist of materials  sub contractor labor  direct consulting fees  and internal labor and related costs associated with the construction activities 
the internal costs that are capitalized consist of salaries and benefits of company employees and the portion of facility costs  including rent  taxes  insurance and utilities  that supports the construction activities 
infrastructure costs are depreciated over the year estimated life of the plant  and headend facilities are depreciated over the estimated life of the specific component  ranging from years for certain electronics to years for tower sites 
costs of operating the plant and the technical facilities  including repairs and maintenance and call completion fees  are expensed as incurred 
in addition  the costs of connecting businesses or residences that have not been previously connected to the service offering are capitalized 
these costs include material  subcontractor and internal labor and related costs as discussed above 
in addition  on site and remote technical assistance during the provisioning process for new digital product offerings are capitalized 
the departmental activities supporting the connection process are tracked through specific metrics  and the portion of departmental costs that is capitalized is determined through a time weighted activity allocation of costs incurred based on time studies used to estimate the average time spent on each activity 
new connections are amortized over years or years for residence wiring and feeder cable to the home  respectively 
the portion of departmental costs related to reconnection  programming service up and down grade  repair and maintenance  and disconnection activities are expensed as incurred 
certain of these capitalized costs are based on estimates of activity levels and other historical statistics 
these estimates are evaluated at least semi annually  and any changes that result  which may be significant  are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which the evaluations are performed 
restructuring charges in  the company recorded a charge to income representing the cost of restructuring its operations 
the costs included in the charge principally consisted of employee termination costs  such as severance pay and outplacement services  and provisions for lease termination costs  including an estimate of costs incurred during a projected vacancy period  estimated brokerage commissions and tenant allowances 
in  the company announced a new operating plan and restructuring which included the closing of retail electronics store locations  the consolidation of customer service call centers and the elimination of certain staff positions 
additionally  in connection with the new operating plan  the company reached an agreement with its supplier of set top boxes which reduced the company s purchase commitments for set top boxes from million in  million in  and million in to a total remaining commitment of million in and nothing thereafter and required the company to make certain other cash payments aggregating million plus interest on a portion of such amount with respect to  among other things  a license for certain software valued at million based on an independent appraisal 
in connection with this plan  the company recorded restructuring charges  which included employee termination costs  such as severance pay and outplacement services costs  and provisions for lease termination costs including an estimate of costs incurred during a projected vacancy period  estimated brokerage commissions and tenant allowances and other related costs and the cost associated with the reduction in required digital set top box commitments 
in  the company eliminated certain staff positions primarily at madison square garden and in the telecommunications services segment and incurred severance costs aggregating approximately million 
in  the company recorded restructuring charges aggregating million associated with the elimination of certain positions in various business units of the company 
costs related to employee terminations are estimated on an individual by individual basis  giving effect to the announced severance plan 
costs for lease terminations are projected in consultation with real estate professionals 
actual lease termination costs may differ from these estimates as a result of changes in market conditions 
because these costs are based on estimates and projections  they can prove to be inaccurate 
changes in estimates  as the plan is implemented and additional facts are gathered  are reflected in current operations as adjustments to the restructuring charges  separately reported and identified

charles f 
dolan is required to fund those expenditures by providing to the company cash or shares of the company s common stock in advance of the company making any expenditures above those contemplated in the shutdown budget 
similarly  if rainbow dbs makes any new commitments or other agreements  the company will segregate cash or shares received from charles f

restricted group as of december   our restricted group consisted of csc holdings and all of its subsidiaries holding our cable operations  which encompassed approximately million subscribers including approximately million digital video subscribers  our consumer high speed data services operations  which encompassed approximately million subscribers  and the commercial telephone and high speed data services operations of lightpath throughout the new york metropolitan area 
the restricted group has a billion revolving credit facility in place that matures on june  as of march   total borrowings outstanding were  million  including million reserved for letters of credit  with a resulting undrawn commitment of million 
the credit facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries and contains several financial covenants  including a limitation on the ratios of debt to cash flow  cash flow to interest expense  and cash flow to debt service expense all as defined in the credit agreement and restrictions on the permitted use of borrowed funds that may limit our ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available 
in january  the restricted group amended the permitted debt to cash flow ratio permitted under the credit facility

principal covenants include a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness based upon a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow as defined in the indentures of and limitations on dividends and distributions subject to an aggregate cap 
there are no covenants  events of default  borrowing conditions or other terms in the restricted group s credit facility or in any of csc holdings other debt securities that are based on changes in the credit ratings assigned by any rating agency 
sources of cash for the restricted group include primarily cash flow from the operations of the businesses in the restricted group and borrowings 
in april  the restricted group also received billion in cash proceeds from the issuance of capital stock to cablevision that it used to redeem certain outstanding securities described above 
the restricted group s principal uses of cash include capital spending  in particular the capital requirements associated with the roll out of its services such as digital video and voice over internet protocol  debt service  including distributions made to cablevision to service interest expense on its public debt securities  other corporate expenses and changes in working capital  as well as discretionary investments that it may fund from time to time 
in addition  the restricted group contributed million to rainbow dbs during we currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements of the restricted group will be met with borrowings under the restricted group s existing bank credit facility and that the restricted group s available borrowing capacity under that facility will be sufficient to meet these requirements for the next twelve months 
cablevision s and csc holdings future access to the public debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by their credit ratings  which are provided by moody s investors service and standard poor s 
in january  standard and poor s affirmed the company s credit ratings  removed all ratings from credit watch status  and assigned a positive outlook 
in march  standard and poor s lowered the outlook on the company s ratings to developing and affirmed all of the company s credit ratings 
any downgrade to the cablevision and csc holdings credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact its ability to raise additional funds

principal covenants include limitations on additional indebtedness  including a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow as defined in the indentures of times  reducing to times after january   limitations on distributions and limitations on the ability to incur liens as per the terms of the senior notes indenture 
although the debt service requirements of the new financings are significant  rns s cash flow from operations net of the debt service requirements is expected to be sufficient to fund its commitments for the next twelve months 
rns s future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by its credit ratings  which are provided by moody s investors service and standard poor s 
in august  moody s and standard poor s assigned ratings to rns s senior secured credit facility and senior and senior subordinated notes 
in january  standard and poor s affirmed rns s credit ratings  removed all ratings from credit watch status  and assigned a positive outlook 
in march  standard and poor s lowered the outlook on rns s ratings to developing and affirmed all of rns s credit ratings 
any future downgrade to rns s credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact rns s ability to raise additional funds

recently issued accounting standards in september  the sec staff issued topic d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill  which requires the direct method of separately valuing all intangible assets and does not permit goodwill to be included in franchise assets 
topic d requires the application of the direct value method to such assets acquired in business combinations completed after september  further  for registrants who have applied the residual method to the valuation of intangible assets for purposes of impairment testing  such registrants should perform an impairment test using a direct value method for all intangible assets that were previously valued using the residual method by no later than the beginning of their first fiscal year beginning after december  impairments recognized upon application of topic d should be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting 
the company currently uses the direct value method for purposes of impairment testing of its indefinite lived intangibles and therefore the adoption of topic d had no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in september  the eitf reached a consensus regarding issue no 
 accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination 
eitf requires an acquirer in a business combination to evaluate any preexisting relationship with the acquiree to determine if the business combination in effect contains a settlement of the preexisting relationship 
a business combination between parties with a preexisting relationship should be viewed as a multiple element transaction 
eitf is effective for business combinations after october   but requires goodwill resulting from prior business combinations involving parties with a preexisting relationship to be tested for impairment by applying the guidance in the consensus in impairment tests performed after october  the application of the provisions of eitf had no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations in in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
statement addresses the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
statement eliminates the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the provisions of statement will be adopted for all nonmonetary exchanges initiated after july  and therefore had no impact to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in december  the fasb issued a revision of fasb statement no

 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance and it establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
statement no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
statement no 
r is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the company will be required to apply the provisions of statement no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in certain equity security prices and interest rates 
our exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the comcast  at t  charter communications  general electric  leapfrog enterprises and adelphia communications common stock held by us 
we have entered into prepaid forward contracts consisting of a collateralized loan and an equity collar to hedge our equity price risk and to monetize the value of these securities other than million shares of adelphia communications common stock 
these contracts  at maturity  are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share  while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price 
the contracts actual hedge prices per share vary depending on average stock prices in effect at the time the contracts were executed 
the contracts actual cap prices vary depending on the maturity and terms of each contract  among other factors 
in the event of an early termination of any of these contracts  we would be obligated to repay the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair value of the underlying stock and the fair value of the equity collar  calculated at the termination date 
the underlying stock and equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value 
as of december   the fair value and the carrying value of our holdings of comcast  at t  charter communications  general electric  leapfrog and adelphia communications common stock aggregated  million 
assuming a change in price  the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately million 
as of december   the net fair value and the carrying value of the equity collar component of the prepaid forward contracts entered into to hedge the equity price risk of these securities aggregated million  a net receivable position 
the maturity  number of shares deliverable at the relevant maturity  hedge price per share  and the lowest and highest cap prices received for each security monetized via a prepaid forward contract are summarized in the following table cap price b security of shares deliverable hedge price per share a maturity low high comcast at t charter communications c general electric adelphia communications leapfrog a represents the price below which we are provided with downside protection and above which we retain upside appreciation 
also represents the price used in determining the cash proceeds payable to us at inception of the contracts 
b represents the price up to which we receive the benefit of stock price appreciation 
c on january   monetization contracts covering million shares of the company s charter communications stock matured 
the company settled its obligations under the related collateralized indebtedness by delivering an equivalent number of charter communications shares and the cash proceeds from the related equity derivative contract that had previously been pledged to the bank counterparty 
in october  the company received million in cash in exchange for all million shares it owned of at t wireless common stock  representing the share price paid in consideration of the merger between at t wireless and cingular wireless llc 
the shares and resultant cash exchanged for such shares had previously been pledged in support of the repayment of the collateralized debt 
as a result of that exchange  the company s prepaid forward contracts relating to its shares of at t wireless were terminated 
the termination provisions under the prepaid forward contracts required the company to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair value of the underlying stock and equity collars 
the company recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately million representing the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the collateralized indebtedness 
at december   the company had settled certain collateralized indebtedness with a fair value of million by releasing to the counterparty cash proceeds from the related prepaid forward contract totaling million and the cash from the merger transaction of million both of which had been pledged in settlement of the debt 
the company received the net difference of million in cash 
the remaining collateralized indebtedness related to the at t wireless shares was settled in february and accordingly  the balance sheet at december  reflects the redemption value of the collateralized indebtedness of million  the fair value of the prepaid forward contracts of million and restricted cash of million 
the company received net cash proceeds of million in february upon settlement of this obligation 
our exposure to interest rate movements results from our use of floating and fixed rate debt to fund our working capital  capital expenditures  and other operational and investment requirements 
to manage interest rate risk  from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates 
such contracts fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to provide an economic hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment 
in addition  from time to time we may utilize short term interest rate lock agreements to hedge the risk that the cost of a future issuance of fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
fair value of debt based on the level of interest rates prevailing at december   the fair value of our fixed rate debt of  million exceeded the carrying value of  million by approximately million 
the fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities 
our floating rate borrowings bear interest in reference to current libor based market rates and thus approximate fair value 
the effect of a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at december  would increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million to  million 
this estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities 
interest rate derivative contracts as of december   we had outstanding interest rate swap contracts to convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt covering a total notional principal amount of million 
as of december   the fair market value and carrying value of these interest rate swap contracts was approximately million  a net liability position  as reflected under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet 
assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve  a basis point increase in interest rates from december  prevailing levels would increase our liability under these contracts to million 
in addition  we had outstanding prepaid interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of  million entered into in connection with our monetization transactions 
as of december   such contracts had a fair market value and carrying value of million  a net liability position  reflected as liabilities under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet 
assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve  a basis point increase in interest rates from december  prevailing levels would increase our liability under these derivative contracts by approximately million to a liability of million
