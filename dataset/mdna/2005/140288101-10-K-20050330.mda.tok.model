item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements  included elsewhere in this filing 
where appropriate  the following discussion includes analysis of our predecessor entity 
general we are a net lease company focused on investing in commercial real estate assets that are leased typically on a long term basis primarily to high credit quality corporate  government and not for profit tenants 
these assets will include mortgage loans and mortgage backed net lease securities debt and direct investments in real estate equity 
we began our business in through private equity capital 
in march  we completed an initial public offering and our common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbol lse 
we intend to elect to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
prior to our initial public offering  we operated primarily as a first mortgage lender using a gain on sale business model  where we sold the loans without retaining any interest in them after origination  either through securitization or whole loan sales 
our mortgage loans have included traditional long term credit tenant first mortgage loans typically to years  year credit tenant loans and a few development type loans and recapitalized loans 
prior to our initial public offering  we historically retained a small number of loans and securities on our balance sheet  though in general  loans had only been held in our portfolio for a short period of time prior to sale 
during this period  we derived our revenues primarily from interest payments on the loans we originated prior to sale and from the sale of those loans to third parties 
our borrowings were on a short term basis  and the interest expense on those borrowings was tied to short term floating interest rates  which are typically lower than long term fixed rates 
upon completion of our initial public offering in march  we changed our strategy from that of a gain on sale originator of net lease loans  to a long term holder of debt  equity and mezzanine net lease assets for portfolio investment  though we do still engage in some gain on sale activities 
an important component of our portfolio investment strategy is to borrow  or leverage  against our assets in order to enable us to originate a larger portfolio of assets and to enhance our returns on invested equity capital 
this strategy entails financing our mostly fixed rate net lease investments by using our existing warehouse facilities on a reasonably short term basis and  as soon as practicable thereafter  financing the majority of these assets on a secured long term fixed rate basis  both through collateralized debt obligations  or cdos  and through traditional first mortgage debt obtained from third party lenders  and other mechanisms 
we typically employ hedging strategies to mitigate interest rate risk while our fixed rate assets are financed in our floating rate warehouse facilities 
we expect our leverage to average to of our assets in portfolio 
all of our financing transactions are now and we expect that they will continue to be  held on balance sheet 
we believe that the combination of assets backed by long term leases with high quality tenants coupled with long term fixed rate financing will produce stable risk adjusted returns on our equity base 
in connection with our initial public offering  we raised net proceeds after all related expenses of approximately million on top of an existing book equity of approximately million 
as of december   we had invested those proceeds into approximately million of net lease assets and have begun to leverage our existing portfolio utilizing our existing floating rate warehouse credit facilities and fixed rate first mortgage debt 
subsequent to december   we closed our first fixed rate long term cdo offering with a principal amount of approximately million 
we issued five classes of notes with an aggregate face amount of million and preferred stock with a principal amount of million 
we retained million in face amount of the notes offered  comprised of the entire face amount of the three most junior note classes and the preferred shares 
we received net proceeds in the transaction of approximately million  approximately million of which was used to repay our borrowings under our short term credit facility with wachovia bank  na since our initial public offering we have been undergoing a period of rapid growth as we continue to add assets to the balance sheet 
this rapid growth in assets is fueling rapid growth in total recurring revenues  net profit and funds from operations 
we believe that we are well positioned in the net lease market and expect that our growth will continue in as we continue to leverage our existing equity capital into a growing portfolio of net lease investments 
we are continuing to see a solid flow of potential net lease transactions and continue to believe that the debt and equity markets will remain favorable to us during the year ahead and allow us to access this pipeline of deals in an economic fashion 
while we believe that conditions will remain favorable for the coming year  there are many factors  most of which are beyond our immediate control  that could impact our ability to sustain our rapid growth 
please see market and other challenges below for a discussion of various factors that could impact our ability to continue to implement our strategy 
while we had success across almost all of our product lines  we were particularly successful in our property acquisition efforts going from no properties on the balance sheet as of the date of our initial public offering  to eight properties totaling approximately million square feet for an aggregate book value of approximately million on december  summary of key transactions in during the year ended december   we completed the following transactions in excess of million acquired an office building net leased to aon corporation in glenview  illinois totaling thousand square feet for an aggregate purchase price of million 
subsequent to the acquisition  we financed the property with a million mortgage from wachovia bank and an approximately million corporate credit note from our subsidiary  caplease  lp  which note has been included in our cdo 
provided long term first mortgage financing on two stores located in chicago  illinois i million secured by a best buy store totaling thousand square feet and ii million secured by a kohl s department store totaling thousand square feet 
the loans are cross defaulted and cross collateralized with one another 
acquired three adjacent office buildings net leased primarily to choice hotels international in silver springs  maryland totaling thousand square feet for an aggregate purchase price of million 
subsequent to the acquisition  we financed the property with a million mortgage from wachovia bank 
market and other challenges the following are factors that could impact our ability to continue to implement our strategy 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  net income or cash flows 
we rely on our ability to price asset investments at a spread over our financing cost 
these spreads are based on market conditions 
various factors that are beyond our control could cause the spreads to converge  making it harder for us to make profitable investments 
these factors include increases in long term interest rates  weakening economic conditions  united states military activities and terrorist activities  ineffectiveness of our hedging strategies  increases in spreads over united states treasuries for our debt  and market dislocations caused by the failure or financial difficulties of a large financial institution or institutions 
in order to grow our asset portfolio  we must raise additional capital 
our capital raising ability will be influenced by market conditions  including investors continued appetite for reit investments and the continued health of the capital markets 
our revenues and cash flows come largely from rental payments from the tenants underlying our net lease asset investments 
moreover  the long term financing cost for our assets is based on the financial health of these tenants at the time the financing is put in place 
adverse developments in the financial condition of our tenants could have an adverse impact on our revenues  financing costs and thus net income and cash flows 
in the last quarter of and early  we have begun to see weakness in our loan origination business 
we are generally seeing fewer transactions and tighter pricing of transactions by our competitors  particularly by conduit lenders such as banks and insurance companies 
we will continue to maintain our disciplined investment approach within this business  and believe that the recent increase in interest rates may improve loan volumes 
winn dixie bankruptcy on february   winn dixie stores inc filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws 
while our balance sheet does not include any property leased to winn dixie or any loan on a winn dixie property  we do own securities from our past securitization transactions with exposure to loans on winn dixie properties and  therefore  the winn dixie bankruptcy 
these securities are exposed to an aggregate of five winn dixie stores through loans made on those properties and winn dixie warehouses distribution and or manufacturing facilities and the winn dixie headquarters building through a pass through certificate representing an interest in another securitization transaction 
winn dixie rejected the lease on one of the five stores and announced its intention to close two of the warehouses 
we have also been advised that the borrower on the loan secured by the rejected store lease does not plan to make the payments due under the loan 
as a result  during fiscal year ended december   we reduced our carry value on the bottom class security in this securitization transaction by million to reflect our estimate of our loss 
while we have also been advised the borrowers under the loans secured by the two warehouses do not plan to make payments due under the related loans  we have not recognized any losses on these or our other security holdings because we are unable to estimate the impact of the foregoing events on our carry value and yields at this time 
our ultimate losses as a result of the winn dixie bankruptcy will depend upon various factors beyond our control  including the liquidation value of the underlying properties and the unpaid principal amount on the related loans  the costs to foreclose and sell the properties  and the availability of other collateral or reserves to absorb the losses on the properties 
to the extent there are losses on any winn dixie properties  those losses will be applied to the face amount of the bonds we hold and will impact our yield to maturity on that investment which will be reflected in a reduction in carry value 
we cannot assure you that winn dixie will not reject the leases on the other properties we have exposure to 
the following table summarizes our exposure to the winn dixie bankruptcy as of december  in thousands securitization classes owned nature of exposure asset write downs aggregate face amount aggregate carry value bscms clf e and f loans on two properties with an aggregate current unpaid principal balance of approximately million 
winn dixie has rejected one of the underlying leases  and the loan on that property has a current unpaid principal balance of million 
the securitization trust includes an expense reserve account of approximately million as of february  that can be utilized by bond holders for realized losses 
the expense reserve account is funded monthly at a rate of approximately  at the expected maturity of the securitization trust  we expect the reserve account to be further funded by a total of approximately million assuming a zero percent reinvestment rate

cmlbc cmlb e  g  h  j and k million pass through trust certificate with exposure to winn dixie warehouse distribution and or manufacturing facilities and the winn dixie headquarters building 
winn dixie has announced its intention to close two of the warehouses 
the remaining certificate balances of all classes in the trust aggregate approximately million 
all classes in the pass through trust share losses on a pro rata basis 
we estimate that for every dollar of loss incurred by the pass through trust  we would incur a loss of approximately on the carry value of our securities

application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of judgments  estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of our accounting policies that are most affected by judgments  estimates and assumptions 
mortgage loans and other assets held for investment 
prior to our initial public offering  our investments in mortgage loans were treated as investments held for sale and carried on our balance sheet at the lower of cost or market 
subsequent to our public equity offering and in the future  our investments in mortgage loans will be treated and accounted for as long term investments  to the extent that we have the ability and intent to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or until maturity 
otherwise  the loans will continue to be accounted for as held for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain mortgage banking activities 
differences between the carrying amount of the loan and its outstanding principal balance are recognized as an adjustment to our yield by the effective interest method 
we are required to periodically evaluate each of our assets held for investment for possible impairment 
impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the asset 
upon determination of impairment  we must establish a specific valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to earnings 
significant judgment is required both in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting loss allowance 
in determining impairment and any loan loss allowance  we evaluate our assets  historical and industry loss experience  economic conditions and trends  collateral values and quality  and other relevant factors 
at december   we had no loss allowances on any of the loans in our portfolio 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate 
we allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
we determine the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land  building and improvements by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land  building and improvements based upon our determination of relative fair values of these assets 
factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected time it would take management to find a tenant to lease the space for the existing lease term a lease up period  considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
we also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions 
in allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  we record above market and below market in place lease values based on the difference between the current in place lease rent and an estimate of current market rents 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets  consisting of in place leases and tenant relationships  is measured by the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant  determined as set forth above 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and tenant relationships based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
the value of in place leases and customer relationships are amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases 
depreciation is determined by the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic useful lives of the properties 
we generally depreciate buildings and building improvements over periods not exceeding years 
direct costs incurred in acquiring properties are capitalized 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
significant renovations which extend the useful life of the properties are capitalized 
securities available for sale we treat our real estate securities as available for sale and account for them in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
as such  they are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported on our balance sheet as a component of other comprehensive income or loss 
fair value is based primarily upon our estimates of value  based upon broker quotations where available  yields on assets of similar credit quality and duration  or good faith estimates of those yields 
the indicated quotations may be subject to significant variability based on market conditions  including interest rates and spreads 
while a liquid market for these securities typically exists  the securities may not be frequently traded and  therefore  we may not be able to sell them at our estimates of value 
changes in market conditions  as well as changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value  could result in a significant increase or decrease in the equity on our balance sheet 
we must also assess whether unrealized losses on securities  if any  reflect a decline in value  which is other than temporary 
if so  we must write the impaired security down to its value through a charge to our statement of operations 
significant judgment is required in this analysis 
in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider whether the decline is due to factors such as changes in interest rates typically temporary or credit downgrades or credit defaults typically other than temporary 
as of december   we recorded a million write down on one of our real estate securities  reflecting our estimate of our loss on that security as a result of the recent winn dixie bankruptcy 
see winn dixie bankruptcy above 
income on these securities is recognized using a level yield methodology based upon a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
these assumptions include the expected disposal date of such security and the rate and timing of principal and interest receipts which may be subject to prepayments  delinquencies and defaults 
these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events  and economic and market conditions  which may alter the assumptions 
derivative instruments and other risk management transactions 
our derivative instruments and other risk management transactions  which we hold for hedging or other risk management purposes  are carried at fair value pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
fair value is based on market quotations 
fair values of these derivatives are subject to significant variability based on many of the same factors as the securities discussed above 
the results of such variability could be a significant increase or decrease in our earnings 
further  if we fail to qualify for hedge accounting treatment  our results of operations may suffer because losses on the derivatives we enter into may not be offset by a change in the fair value of the related hedged transaction 
prior to our conversion to a reit on march   we used derivatives and other risk management transactions to hedge the interest rate risk of our fixed rate mortgage loans 
since march   we have used and in the future we expect to continue to use derivative transactions designated primarily as cash flow hedges to hedge our risk of changes in the interest related cash flows on our forecasted future borrowings 
revenue recognition 
as part of our year credit tenant loan program  we originate a loan and bifurcate the loan into two notes  a real estate note and a corporate credit note 
we generally sell the real estate note to a third party and retain the corporate credit note in our portfolio 
during  we sold three real estate notes for aggregate proceeds of million  and recognized gains of  we compute our gain by comparing our sales proceeds on the note to its cost basis 
we compute our cost basis on the note by allocating our entire basis in the loan among the two notes based on the present value of expected cash flows on each note 
in computing present values  we estimate a discount rate based on a benchmark rate plus a market spread based on the underlying credit 
our estimates reflect market rates and we believe they are reasonable 
however  the use of different estimates could have an impact on our gain on sale revenue 
results of operations during the fourth quarter of  we continued to execute on our business plan as a long term holder of debt  equity and mezzanine investments in net lease assets 
our focus during the quarter was on i closing the long term mortgage loans in our pipeline  ii completing the net lease property acquisitions in our pipeline  iii preparing our first collateralized debt obligation  iv continuing to leverage our net lease portfolio  and v continuing to implement our marketing plan to communicate to the market about our expanded capabilities 
comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december  the following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended december  to the comparable period in revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily attributable to increases in interest income from mortgage loans and securities and increases in rental income  offset by a decrease in gain on sale of mortgage loans 
interest income increased million  or  to million 
the increase was due to larger overall asset investments  including both mortgage loans and cmbs investments 
gain on sale of mortgage loans and securities decreased from million to million 
the decrease was due to curtailment on our loan sale activity during  as we transitioned from a gain on sale to held for investment strategy upon completion of our initial public offering 
rental income and property expense recoveries  in the aggregate  increased million to million  as we did not own any investments in real estate during other revenue increased million to million  primarily as a result of receiving million after related expenses as a deal cancellation fee on a potential property acquisition 
expenses 
total expenses increased million  or  to million 
the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to higher levels of general and administrative expenses as a result of our status as a public company  property related expenses  offset by a reduction in loss on derivatives and short sales of securities 
interest expense  including interest expense to affiliates  increased million  or  from million to million 
this primarily consisted of million of interest expense related to property mortgages originated or assumed in in addition  interest expense on our borrowings under our secured warehouse lines of credit repurchase agreement obligations  decreased million  or  from million to million 
this was the result of lower average borrowing levels in after the completion of our initial public offering in march  we repaid all of the amounts outstanding under our credit facilities 
we began borrowing under these facilities again during august loss on derivatives and short sales of securities decreased million  or  from million to million 
this was primarily the result of the change in the way we hedge interest rates upon the completion of our initial public offering 
prior to our initial public offering  we employed fair value hedges of our assets  along with derivatives and short sales of securities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
after our initial public offering date  we terminated all of the outstanding fair value hedges  derivative and short sale positions  and converted to cash flow hedges against our expected future financings 
loss on securities was million for a write down on one of our real estate securities  reflecting our estimate of loss on that security as a result of the recent winn dixie bankruptcy 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  from million to million  due primarily to increased expenses associated with our change to operating as a public company  including liability insurance 
general and administrative expense stock based compensation of million was recognized during the period 
this includes  million related to the vesting of stock issued under our stock plan to our employees simultaneous with our initial public offering and million recognized during the quarter ended march  related to stock sold to certain current and former employees during november at a discount to the initial public offering price 
deferred compensation expense related to unvested shares granted is included on our consolidated balance sheets under deferred compensation expense and will be charged to our statement of operations ratably over the remaining vesting period which ends during march depreciation and amortization expense on real property increased million to million  as we did not own any investments in real estate during net income 
net income decreased from million to million  as a result of the factors discussed above 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  the following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended december  to the comparable period in revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million 
the net increase was attributable to an increase in gain on sale of mortgage loans  partially offset by a decrease in interest income and a decrease in other revenue 
interest income decreased million  or  to million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average size of our portfolio and a lower interest rate environment 
gain on sale of mortgage loans and securities increased million  or  to million 
the increase was due to higher margins on our loan sale activity during the period 
we sold million of loans in the period as compared to million of loans for the comparable period in other revenue decreased million  or  to million 
this decrease was primarily due to a decline in advisory revenue between the comparative periods 
expenses 
total expenses decreased million  or  to million 
the net decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest expense and a decrease in expense associated with risk management and hedging transactions 
interest expense on our borrowings under our secured warehouse lines of credit repurchase agreement obligations  including interest paid to members  decreased million  or  to million 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the underlying libor rate and a decrease in our average loan portfolio during average one month libor rates during the year ended december  were as compared to for the comparative period 
loss on derivatives and short sales of securities decreased million  or  to million 
this expense includes the carry expense incurred on open hedge and other risk management positions  as well as gains or losses from hedging and other risk management transactions related to sold loans 
carry expense is a function of the difference between short term and long term interest rates  and changes in the shape of the yield curve affect this item 
gains and losses on derivatives and short sales of securities are generally a function of the change in long term interest rates  with losses generally resulting from declines in long term rates  and gains resulting from increases in long term rates 
the decline in the overall expense was due to a lower average level of assets in our portfolio during the period  less downward volatility in interest rates during the period  and the accounting impact of gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedge transactions 
for the year ended december   yields on long term treasury rates year notes increased from on december  to on december  for the year ended december   yields on year treasury notes declined significantly from to 
this difference in rate change for the comparative periods contributed significantly to the decline in the loss on derivatives and short sales of securities 
our predecessor recognized hedge ineffectiveness expense of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of million 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million  as a result of the factors discussed above 
business segments beginning with this annual report on form k  we have begun reporting our results through two operating segments lending investments  and operating net lease real estate 
segment data for are as follows lending investments operating net lease real estate corporate unallocated total in thousands total revenue total expenses net income loss total assets a comparison of segment performance is not included herein as we had no real property acquisition business prior to our initial public offering in march  and our net lease mortgage debt business was under a gain on sale rather than portfolio business model prior to our initial public offering 
funds from operations funds from operations  or ffo  is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe ffo is a useful additional measure of our performance because it facilitates an understanding of our operating performance after adjustment for certain non cash expenses  such as real estate depreciation  which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
in addition  we believe that ffo provides useful information to the investment community about our financial performance as compared to other reits  since ffo is generally recognized as an industry standard for measuring the operating performance of a reit 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
since all companies and analysts do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  our calculation of ffo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we calculate ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit which defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the following table reconciles our net income to ffo for the year ended december  ffo is not a relevant measure for us for years prior to because we were not a reit during those periods 
total per share in thousands  except per share amounts net income adjustments add depreciation and amortization expense on real property funds from operations the weighted average number of shares outstanding for was  basic and diluted 
we had gains on sales of mortgage loans included in net income and ffo of  in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
as a reit  we will be required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis  and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income in order to comply with the distribution requirements of the code and to avoid federal income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
we declared total dividends of per share during the year ended december   including in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
we believe that our working capital and cash provided by operations are sufficient to fund our operations and pay our distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
however  our strategy contemplates additional net lease investments  and we believe we will reach our targeted leverage level in the next three to six months  at which point we will need to raise additional debt or equity capital  or both  in order to continue to implement our strategy 
we intend to file a shelf registration statement to register additional debt and equity capital in the early part of the second quarter of we may issue public or private debt or equity capital  or both  to satisfy our liquidity needs 
we expect to raise capital in the second or third quarter of  although the precise timing will be impacted by our investment activities for the remainder of and market conditions 
our ability to raise capital is influenced by market conditions  and we cannot assure you conditions for raising capital will be favorable for us at any time 
see market and other challenges above 
short term liquidity and financing 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through our available cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operations  as well as existing secured credit facilities 
during september  we entered into a master repurchase agreement with wachovia bank  na to finance our asset investments on a short term basis prior to obtaining long term financing 
the master repurchase agreement replaces our existing credit facilities with wachovia bank 
under the agreement  caplease  lp and certain of our other subsidiaries will sell assets to wachovia bank and agree to repurchase those assets on a date certain at a repurchase price generally equal to the original purchase price plus accrued but unpaid interest 
each asset financed under the facility will be purchased by wachovia bank at a percentage of the asset s value on the date of origination the purchase rate and we will pay interest to wachovia bank at prevailing short term interest rates plus a pricing spread 
we have agreed to a schedule of purchase rates and pricing spreads with wachovia bank generally based upon the class and credit rating of the asset financed 
the facility is recourse to us and capital lease funding  inc has agreed to guarantee all obligations of its subsidiaries under the agreement 
for financial reporting purposes  we characterize all of our borrowings under the facility as on balance sheet financing transactions  meaning the assets financed will remain on our balance sheet 
the repurchase agreement is a million uncommitted facility  meaning wachovia bank must agree to each asset financed under the agreement 
the facility may be increased to million if we request and wachovia bank agrees 
the agreement expires on september   but may be extended for not more than two successive day periods if we request and wachovia agrees 
we can finance each of our existing primary products under the agreement  including commercial real estate whole loans  commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and acquisitions of commercial real estate 
commercial real estate acquisitions will be financed through mortgage loans made by caplease to a subsidiary of caplease formed for the purpose of owning the real property acquired followed by the sale of such mortgage loans to wachovia under the terms of the facility 
unless otherwise agreed to by wachovia  for any asset financed under the facility for more than days wachovia may a require us to remove the asset from the facility or b require all income generated by the asset be applied to reducing the outstanding balance under the facility 
the agreement includes sublimits on certain asset classes and credit or tenant concentrations 
if at any time i the repurchase price of any financed asset exceeds its asset value as defined in the agreement  ii either standard poor s or moody s downgrades any asset financed under the facility or iii the aggregate repurchase price of all financed assets exceeds the maximum facility size  wachovia bank may require us to repurchase assets or contribute additional cash or other eligible assets to satisfy the difference 
if required  these payments could be material and could have a material adverse effect on our operations  or on our ability to make further net lease investments 
we are required to maintain the following financial covenants during the term of the agreement liquidity as defined in the agreement of at least million  and consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the agreement of at least million plus of the aggregate net proceeds from future equity offerings or capital contributions 
if we are unable to finance assets under this facility  our ability to continue to execute our business plan could be materially adversely affected 
wachovia investors  inc  an affiliate of wachovia bank  owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
from time to time  we may sell net lease assets to  or finance net lease assets on a long term basis with  wachovia bank or its affiliates on what we believe are fair market terms 
affiliates of wachovia bank have performed investment banking services for us  including in connection with our initial public offering and initial cdo transaction  and we expect they will continue to do so in the future 
in addition  wachovia bank acts as servicer of our net lease loan assets and the transfer agent of our common stock 
we had million outstanding as of december  under our wachovia credit facility  which borrowings were secured by commercial mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of million  and cmbs with a face amount of million 
as of december   we had million available under our credit facilities  excluding our bank of america facility which expired unused on march  as of december   we were in compliance with the terms of the agreements with our secured lenders 
we do not currently anticipate any difficulty in maintaining compliance with these terms in future periods 
we believe our relationship with wachovia bank is excellent 
however  because our secured credit facility with wachovia bank is uncommitted and is generally terminable at will by the lender  we cannot make any assurance that this facility will continue to be available to us 
long term liquidity and financing 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements generally through cash provided by operations  long term financings on our net lease asset investments and issuances of debt and equity securities 
we finance our investments through short term financing arrangements and  as soon as practicable thereafter  we obtain long term financing for these investments  generally on a secured basis 
long term financing can be in the form of traditional mortgage debt  cdos or other debt mechanisms 
as of december   we have financed an aggregate of million of assets in portfolio on a long term basis through the issuance or assumption of long term debt of million 
all of our long term debt obligations as of that date represent traditional mortgage debt 
we completed our first cdo financing in march for a discussion of this transaction  see business recent developments long term financings 
we expect our leverage to average to of our assets in portfolio 
in a traditional mortgage debt financing  we enter into one or more promissory notes at a fixed rate of interest 
the notes typically mature over a long term period of approximately ten years and debt service is payable monthly 
the notes are generally non recourse to us but are secured by a mortgage on the property and an assignment of the underlying lease and rents on the property 
the notes generally include non recourse exceptions for certain losses  damages or expenses to the lender  including those incurred as a result of the following waste to the mortgaged property or damage to the mortgaged property as a result of our intentional misconduct or gross negligence  the existence of hazardous substances or radon on the mortgaged property or the failure to comply with environmental laws or regulations with respect to the mortgaged property  and a fraud or material misrepresentation committed by us or any person authorized to act on our behalf or the failure of us or anyone authorized to make statements on our behalf to disclose a material fact 
the notes may become fully recourse if we fail to comply with certain covenants prohibiting us from transferring or further encumbering the mortgaged property or requiring us to take or refrain from taking various actions in order to preserve the status of our borrower as a single purpose entity  or the mortgaged property becomes an asset in a bankruptcy proceeding of the borrower 
the notes may be fully amortizing or require a balloon payment at maturity 
to the extent the loan requires a balloon payment at maturity  we would expect to refinance that payment at maturity 
the notes are typically subject to customary events of default  including the failure to pay principal and or interest or the determination that any representation or warranty made in the loan documents is false or misleading in any material respect 
upon an event of default  the notes will generally become immediately due and payable  at the option of the payee 
in a typical cdo financing  we will borrow money through a trust or other entity the cdo and post or sell assets as collateral  giving the cdo investors a first priority claim on the collateral posted and the right to foreclose on the collateral upon an event of default 
in turn  the cdo will issue securities to investors to fund our borrowing 
our borrowing will bear a fixed rate of interest 
we will continue to own the assets financed through a cdo and will be entitled to receive cash flows from the assets to the extent they exceed debt service on the cdo 
once the cdo has been established  changes in interest rates  credit spreads or the credit quality of collateral will generally have no impact on cash flows on the cdo collateral or our financing cost under the cdo 
we expect that the term of the cdos we will use will be approximately years 
statement of cash flows the net cash flow provided by used in operating activities increased from million in the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   and decreased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  our net cash provided by operating activities in reflects adjustments for non cash items of expenses for amortization of stock based compensation million and depreciation and amortization million  including million on real property 
the change from to was primarily a result of our transition to a portfolio business model in the first quarter of prior to our initial public offering  our loan and security investment activity was classified as operating activities 
under our current strategy  these investments are treated as investing activities 
the change from to resulted primarily from greater investments in securities and slightly lower net loan investments proceeds from loan sales less principal advanced on loans in investing activities used million during the year ended december   which primarily resulted from net investments in real estate of million  net investments in mortgage loans of million and net investments in cmbs and corporate bonds of million 
investing activities used million during the year ended december   and provided million during the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million  reflecting net proceeds from our initial public offering of million before prepaid offering expenses of approximately million and net borrowings under long term mortgage financings million and repurchase agreements million  partially offset by dividends paid of million 
we used million of our net proceeds from the initial public offering to repay our debt obligations under our repurchase agreements 
as of december   we have fully invested the proceeds from our initial public offering  and we have begun to use our credit facilities to continue to fund our investment activities 
as of december   our borrowings under these credit facilities totaled million 
cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million and were primarily the result of net borrowings under our secured warehouse credit facilities 
financing activities used million during the year ended december   primarily reflecting net repayments under our secured warehouse facilities 
see our consolidated statements of cash flows included in the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing for a reconciliation of our cash position for the periods described above 
derivative and other risk management transactions in connection with our fixed rate lending activities  we have entered into derivative and other risk management transactions in order to insulate or hedge the value of our future debt obligations from changes in underlying interest rates during the period between origination and permanent financing of our loans and other net lease assets 
historically  we have done so by entering into treasury and agency lock transactions  short sales of us government and agency obligations and interest rate swap transactions 
in the future  we expect that our derivative and other risk management activities will consist primarily of interest rate swaps 
this hedging and other risk management activity appears on our statement of operations as a gain or loss on derivatives and short sales of securities 
in the year ended december   we had million in loss on short sales and derivative transactions  partially offset by a million gain on sales of net lease loans 
in the year ended december   we had million in loss on short sales and derivative transactions  offset by million gain on the sale of net lease loans 
consistent with the reporting requirements under sfas no 
 interest rate swaps are marked to fair value at each reporting date  with a corresponding offset to other comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity 
in general  we expect to hedge our liabilities against changes in underlying interest rates until the related assets have been financed on a long term basis 
some assets  including mezzanine loans and structured securities  may not be hedged at all 
we do not use the derivative and short sales of us government and agency obligations that are part of our hedge and other risk management strategy for trading or speculative purposes and we only enter into contracts or hedging arrangements with major financial institutions 
we settle our derivative and other risk management transactions in cash 
therefore  upon settlement  we will pay or receive cash for the net amount due 
these amounts could be material and could have a material impact positive or negative on our liquidity 
we seek to settle these transactions simultaneous with the closing of our financing transaction for the related hedged asset to mitigate the possible adverse impact on our liquidity 
contractual obligations the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our contractual obligations as of december  less than year years years after years total mortgage notes payable operating leases repurchase agreement obligations total off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had an off balance sheet arrangement involving a letter of credit that we have posted in connection with a securitization we completed in upon the closing of the securitization  the collateral pool consisted of fixed rate corporate and united states post office net lease loans in the aggregate principal balance of approximately million  with ratings from s p on the underlying tenants or guarantors or parents ranging from aa to not rated 
as of december   the collateral pool s loan balance had amortized to approximately million  and the pool consisted of approximately investment grade tenants  below investment grade tenants and tenants not rated 
the weighted average credit rating of the pool as of december  was approximately equivalent to a bbb credit rating 
our maximum potential liability under the letter of credit is million 
the letter of credit expires on february  the trustee may draw the letter of credit if there are realized losses on the mortgage loans that would create a shortfall in the interest or principal on any investment grade certificate 
the letter of credit may be withdrawn when the ratings of the investment grade certificates are no longer dependent upon the credit support provided by the letter of credit 
as of december   there had been no defaults and no losses on any of the mortgage loans in the collateral pool 
during february  one of the mortgage loans on a property net leased to winn dixie defaulted  as a result of the bankruptcy of winn dixie 
however  management does not expect any draw on the letter of credit as a result of this mortgage default or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices  rate indices or other market factors 
we will be exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates  credit spreads  tenant credit ratings and equity prices 
we attempt to mitigate certain of these risks by entering into hedge and other risk management transactions during the short term and fixed rate financings for the long term 
we seek to obtain long term fixed rate financing as soon as practicable after we make an asset investment 
there can be no assurance  however  that such mitigation strategies will be completely or even partially successful 
the level of our exposure to market risk is subject to factors beyond our control  including political risk including terrorism  monetary and tax policy  general economic conditions and a variety of other associated risks 
interest rate exposure 
substantially all of our assets have exposures to long term interest rate movements  primarily the yields on long term us treasuries 
this includes our mortgage loans and real estate securities 
our hedge and other risk management transactions will also have exposures to movements in interest rates 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest bearing assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities 
changes in interest rates can also affect our net income from any investments that we make in net leased real estate  which is the difference between the rental income earned and the interest expense on the liabilities associated with the properties 
changes in the level of interest rates may also affect  among other things  our ability to originate or acquire mortgage loans and securities  real estate properties  and the value of our mortgage loans and other assets 
credit spread curve exposure 
our mortgage loans and real estate securities are subject to spread risk 
the majority of these assets are fixed rate assets  which are valued based on a market credit spread over the rate payable on fixed rate us treasuries of like maturity 
in other words  their value is dependent on the yield demanded on such assets by the market based on their credit relative to us treasuries 
changes in the general credit markets can lead to changes in the required yield on these assets  which would result in a higher or lower value for our mortgage loans and real estate securities 
if the required market yields increase as a result of these general credit market changes  the value of our fixed rate assets would decline relative to us treasuries 
conversely  if the required market yields decrease as a result of these general credit market changes  the value of our fixed rate assets would increase relative to us treasuries 
these changes in the market value of our fixed rate asset portfolio may affect the equity on our balance sheet or our results of operations directly through provisions for losses on mortgage loans or through unrealized losses on available for sale securities 
these value changes may also affect our ability to borrow and access capital 
furthermore  shifts in the us treasury yield curve  which represents the market s expectations of future interest rates  would also affect the yield required on our fixed rate assets 
this would have similar effects on the fair value of our fixed rate assets  our financial position and results of operations  as would a change in general credit spreads 
tenant credit rating exposure 
our mortgage loans and real estate securities are subject to risks due to credit rating changes of the tenants under the related net lease obligations 
the credit quality of a particular net lease asset is highly dependent on the credit rating of the related tenant obligor of the net lease 
deterioration in the tenant s credit rating can lead to changes in the required yield on the related asset  which would result in a lower value for our net lease assets 
this would have similar effects on the fair value of our fixed rate assets  our financial position and results of operations  as would a change in general credit spreads 
in addition  precipitous declines in the credit rating of a particular tenant prior to our obtaining long term financing may significantly impede or eliminate our ability to finance the asset 
we manage this risk by maintaining diversity among our credits and assessing our aggregate exposure to ratings classes  in particular lower rated classes 
equity price risk exposure 
we may seek to raise capital by sale of our common stock 
our ability to do so is dependent upon the market price of our common stock 
fair values 
for certain of our financial instruments  fair values are not readily available since there are no active trading markets as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties 
accordingly  we derive or estimate fair values using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated cash flows may be subjective and imprecise 
changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material affect on these estimated fair values 
the fair values indicated below are indicative of the interest rate and credit spread environment as of december   and may not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate  credit spread fluctuations  or changes in the ratings of the tenants under related net leases 
the following summarizes certain data regarding our interest rate sensitive instruments carrying amount notional amount weighted average effective interest rate maturity date fair value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans held for investment various mortgage loans held for sale securities available for sale cmbs structuring fees receivable n a n a derivative assets n a n a liabilities repurchase agreements short term mortgage notes payable derivative liabilities n a n a with the exception of one loan  this portfolio of mortgage loans bears interest at fixed rates 
we have estimated the fair value of this portfolio of loans based on sales of loans with similar credit and structural characteristics where available  and management s estimate of fair values where comparable sales information is not available 
the maturity dates for the mortgage loans range from through in connection with our initial public offering in march  we changed from a gain on sale to a hold for investment strategy 
the fair value assumptions described in footnote also apply to mortgage loans held for sale 
securities available for sale represent subordinate interests in securitizations previously completed by us cmbs  as well as pass through certificates representing senior mortgage debt 
structuring fees receivable represent cash flows receivable by us from the sale of loans to third party purchasers 
the notional values for the cmbs are shown at their respective face amounts 
fair value for the cmbs is based on third party quotations  where obtainable  or our estimate of fair value  based on yields of comparably rated securities in the cmbs market 
fair value for the structuring fees receivable is shown at our amortized cost for these items 
for the securities available for sale  we receive current monthly interest coupon payments  and contractual principal payments as scheduled 
payments of principal are being received only on our investments in the yahoo and cvs pass through certificates 
scheduled principal payments on our other cmbs investments begin in these instruments represent hedging and risk management transactions involving interest rate swaps 
they have been valued by reference to market quotations 
our repurchase agreements bear interest at floating rates  and we believe that for similar financial instruments with comparable credit risks  the effective rates approximate market value 
accordingly  the carrying amounts outstanding are believed to approximate fair value 
we estimate the fair value of mortgage notes payable using a discounted cash flow analysis  based on our estimates of market interest rates 
for mortgages where we have an early payment right  we also consider the prepayment amount to evaluate the fair value 
our generally higher level of interest rate sensitive instruments at december  reflects our greater level of assets and liabilities as a result of our initial public offering in march and change to an investment strategy upon completion of our initial public offering 
scheduled maturities of interest rate sensitive instruments as of december  are as follows expected maturity dates thereafter in thousands  notional amounts where appropriate  otherwise carrying amounts mortgage loans held for investment securities available for sale cmbs structuring fees receivable derivative assets repurchase agreements mortgage notes payable derivative liabilities the expected maturity dates shown for mortgage loans  securities available for sale and structuring fees receivable are based on the contractual terms of the underlying assets 
these assets  based on our current operating strategy  are held for investment 
our liabilities with respect to repurchase agreements and derivative obligations are short term in nature and  accordingly  are listed in the current period 
the material assumptions used to determine fair value are included in footnotes through in the immediately preceding table 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in other documents we file or furnish with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
risks related to operations we may fail to continue to originate and or acquire net lease assets 
origination of additional net lease loans and acquisition of additional net lease real properties is critical to the success of our business strategy 
the net lease market is highly competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify net lease opportunities that meet our underwriting and return criteria 
if we are unable to continue to originate net lease loans and purchase net lease real properties that are acceptable to us  we may be unable to execute our business plan  which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition 
we may fail to originate or acquire profitable assets 
our investment strategy is based on originating and purchasing profitable assets  as determined by our returns on those assets less our related financing cost 
we originate or purchase long term fixed rate assets and generally seek to finance those assets with lower coupon long term fixed rate debt  thus earning a profit or spread 
we generally obtain long term financing for our assets after we acquire them 
therefore  we price our assets at origination or acquisition based on our assumption about our expected future financing cost 
if our cost to finance our assets increases over our assumptions between the time we commit to purchase the asset and when we obtain long term financing  the profit or spread we expected to earn on the asset and our overall portfolio will erode 
various factors could cause our financing cost to increase  including increases in long term interest rates  weakening economic conditions  united states military activity and terrorist activities  ineffectiveness of our hedging strategies  a decline in the credit rating of the underlying tenant  and market dislocations caused by the failure or financial difficulties of a large financial institution or institutions 
our failure to originate and acquire profitable assets would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations and financial condition 
we conduct a significant part of our business with wachovia bank  na and its affiliates and their continued business with us is not guaranteed 
we rely on wachovia bank  na and its affiliates in various aspects of our business 
for example wachovia bank  na provides us with short term financing through a million repurchase facility 
through december   we obtained million of long term mortgage financings from wachovia bank 
affiliates of wachovia bank  na have performed investment banking services for us  including in connection with our initial public offering and our initial cdo transaction 
wachovia bank  na acts as servicer of our net lease asset investments and as transfer agent for our common stock 
these parties are not obligated to do business with us and any adverse developments in their business or in our relationship with them could result in these parties choosing not to do business with us or a significant reduction in our business with them 
termination of our business with wachovia bank  na or its affiliates or a significant reduction in our business with these parties could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our stockholders 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income each year to our stockholders 
if we are unable to execute our business plan successfully or in the event of future downturns in our operating results and financial performance  we may be unable to declare or pay distributions to our stockholders 
the timing and amount of distributions are in the sole discretion of our board of directors  which will consider  among other factors  our financial performance  debt service requirements  and capital expenditure requirements 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash to fund distributions required to maintain our reit tax status or to fund any distributions 
our management has limited experience operating a reit or a public company or executing our business plan 
our management has limited experience operating a reit or a public company or in executing our business plan 
therefore  you should be cautious in drawing conclusions about the ability of our management team to do so 
risks related to net lease assets an adverse change in the financial condition of one or more tenants underlying our net lease investments could have a material adverse impact on us 
the credit quality of the tenant underlying a net lease asset is at the core of our underwriting process 
an adverse change in the tenant s financial condition  including a bankruptcy of the tenant  could have a material adverse impact on us 
for example we rely on rent payments from the tenants underlying our net lease investments for our cash flows  and any bankruptcy  insolvency or failure to make rental payments when due could result in a material reduction of our cash flows and material losses to our company 
an adverse change in the financial condition of one or more tenants underlying our net lease investments or a decline in the credit rating of one or more tenants underlying our net lease investments could result in a margin call if the related asset is being financed on our short term repurchase facilities  and could make it more difficult for us to arrange long term financing for that asset 
the value of our net lease loan and real estate securities investments are primarily driven by the credit quality of the underlying tenant or tenants  and an adverse change in the subject tenant s financial condition or a decline in the credit rating of such tenant may result in a decline in the value of our net lease investments and a charge to our statement of operations 
the occurrence of material adverse events with respect to tenants to whom we have a high degree of exposure or a downturn in their industries could have a material adverse impact on us 
of our assets in portfolio as of december   approximately million  or  involve properties leased to  or leases guaranteed by  aon corporation 
in addition  two other corporations lease or guarantee leases underlying investments we have made which represent over but are less than of our assets in portfolio 
any financial difficulty or bankruptcy of one or more of such tenants or guarantors resulting in nonpayment or delay in payment of rental payments and other amounts due under the related leases could  as a result of this concentration  have a greater adverse effect on us than a similar problem with a less significant tenant 
in addition  our assets in portfolio as of december  involve properties leased to  or leases guaranteed by  cvs corporation  walgreen co 
and other companies in the retail drug industry 
approximately million  or  of our assets in portfolio as of december   involve properties leased to  or leases guaranteed by  companies in the retail drug industry 
any downturn in the retail drug industry or in any other industry in which we have a large investment could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
among other risks  the retail drug industry is subject to the risks of reductions in third party reimbursements of prescription drugs  the growth of mail order prescription providers  increases in governmental regulation  introduction of new brand and generic prescriptions drugs  inability to attract and retain qualified pharmacists and management personnel  and competition 
we may be subject to geographic concentrations that could make us more susceptible to adverse events in these areas 
as of december   an aggregate million  or  of our assets in portfolio were investments in properties located in chicago  illinois and its neighboring suburbs 
an economic downturn or other adverse events or conditions such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters in this area  or any other area where we have significant credit concentration in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we may make errors in analyzing the data of certain of our net lease tenants and intend to make loans on properties leased to non investment grade tenants 
approximately million  or  of our assets in portfolio as of december   involve properties leased to  or leases guaranteed by  companies without a publicly available credit rating 
a portion of our assets is expected to continue to involve tenants who do not have publicly available credit ratings 
we expect to obtain a private rating for these assets after origination or acquisition and prior to obtaining long term financing 
when we make an investment in an asset where the underlying tenant has no publicly available credit rating  we prepare an internally generated credit analysis  after a review of available financial data 
we may misinterpret or incorrectly analyze this data 
these mistakes may cause us to make investments we would not have otherwise made and may ultimately result in losses on one or more of our investments 
in addition  approximately million  or  of our assets in portfolio as of december   involve properties leased to  or leases guaranteed by  companies whose credit rating is below investment grade 
these investments will have a greater risk of default and bankruptcy than investments on properties net leased exclusively to investment grade tenants 
our balance sheet  as of december   also includes a million investment in a structured interest that is unrated 
the lack of such a rating generally reflects the fact that the underlying collateral is weaker than what would be found in a rated interest  and therefore  this investment has a greater risk of default than an investment in a rated interest 
we may be unable to obtain financing  and our existing secured warehouse facility may be unavailable to us 
we expect to borrow money under short term secured warehouse credit facilities to fund our acquisitions and originations of net lease assets 
we currently have a secured warehouse facility with wachovia bank  na our warehouse facility is uncommitted as wachovia bank must agree to each asset contributed to the facility 
we cannot assure you that we may be able to draw funds under this facility at any given time 
under the terms of this facility  we sell commercial mortgage assets to wachovia bank as security in exchange for funds to finance our net lease investments 
wachovia bank owns the assets that we sell to it as security for our borrowings and holds those assets subject to our right or obligation to repurchase later 
in the event that wachovia bank files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent  our assets subject to our repurchase rights or obligations may become subject to the bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings  thus depriving us  at least temporarily  of the benefit of these assets 
in addition  in the event of our bankruptcy  wachovia bank may qualify for special treatment under the bankruptcy code  giving it the ability to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code 
in that case  our bankruptcy estate might include our repurchase rights  but would not include our assets held by wachovia bank subject to our repurchase rights 
in the event of a bankruptcy of one of our borrowers or an affiliate of one of our borrowers  our financial condition and operating results may suffer 
although we generally use bankruptcy remote structures when we fund a loan  one of our borrowers may become a debtor in a bankruptcy case as a result of liabilities unrelated to ownership and operation of its net leased real property or  if an affiliate of one of our borrowers becomes the debtor in a bankruptcy case  a court may order that our borrower s assets and liabilities be substantively consolidated with those of its affiliate 
either of these events could delay or reduce payments on our loan assets  delay our ability to foreclose on the net leased property and may have an adverse affect on our financial condition and operating results 
risks related to borrowings we expect to borrow a significant amount of debt to finance our portfolio  which may subject us to increased risk of loss 
we expect to incur significant indebtedness in our operations 
we expect that substantially all of our assets will be pledged as collateral for our borrowings on average to of our assets in portfolio 
required debt service will reduce cash and net income available for operations or distribution to our stockholders 
if the income on assets financed with borrowed funds fails to cover the cost of the borrowings  we may experience net losses on assets not yet financed with long term debt or lower net profits 
if we default on our debt service obligations  we would be at risk of losing some or all of our assets as our lenders will have a first priority claim on the collateral we pledge and the right to foreclose 
our ability to achieve our investment objectives depends to a significant extent on our ability to borrow money in sufficient amounts and on sufficiently favorable terms  thus earning incremental returns 
we may not be able to achieve the degree of leverage we believe to be optimal due to decreases in the proportion of the value of our assets against which we can borrow  decreases in the market value of our assets  increases in interest rates to the extent we have assets financed with variable rate debt  including our secured warehouse lines of credit  changes in the availability of financing in the market  conditions in the lending market and other factors 
this may cause us to experience losses or less profit than would otherwise be the case 
we intend to continue to finance our net lease assets over the long term through a variety of means  including through the use of cdos and mortgage financing 
our ability to execute this strategy will depend on various conditions in the markets for financing in this manner which are beyond our control  including the liquidity of these markets and maintenance of attractive credit spreads 
we cannot assure you that these markets will remain an efficient source of long term financing for our net lease assets 
if our strategy is not viable  we will have to find alternative forms of long term financing for our net lease assets  as our secured warehouse lines will not accommodate long term financing 
this could subject us to more recourse indebtedness and the risk that debt service on less efficient forms of financing would require a larger portion of our cash flows  thereby reducing cash available for distribution to our stockholders  funds available for operations  as well as for future net lease investments  and could result in net losses and the erosion of our equity 
hedging transactions may not effectively protect us against anticipated risks and may subject us to certain other risks and costs 
our current policy is to enter into hedging transactions primarily to protect us from the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our portfolio of net lease assets from the date on which we commit a rate or price to a borrower or seller and until the date the asset is pledged to secure long term financing or is sold 
our hedging policy exposes us to certain risks  among them the following our hedging strategy may not have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
no hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates 
there will be many market risks against which we may not be able to hedge effectively  including changes in the spreads of corporate bonds  cmbs or cdos over the underlying us treasury rates 
we may or may not hedge any risks with respect to cmbs or cdos that we may purchase or hold for investment 
our hedging strategy may serve to reduce the returns which we could possibly achieve if we did not hedge certain risks 
because we intend to structure our hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a reit  we will be limited in the type of hedging transactions that we may use 
hedging costs increase as the period covered by the hedging increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates 
we may increase our hedging activity and thus increase our hedging costs during periods when interest rates are volatile or rising 
the enforceability of agreements underlying derivative transactions may depend on compliance with applicable statutory and commodity and other regulatory requirements and  depending on the identity of the counterparty  applicable international requirements 
a default by a party with whom we enter into a hedging transaction may result in the loss of unrealized profits and force us to cover our resale commitments  if any  at the then current market price 
although generally we will seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions  it may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty  and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover our risk 
there can be no assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold  and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration  which could result in losses 
we may fail to qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
we record derivative and hedge transactions in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  specifically statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
under these standards  we may fail to qualify for hedge accounting treatment for a number of reasons  including  if we use instruments that do not meet the sfas definition of a derivative such as short sales  we fail to satisfy sfas hedge documentation and hedge effectiveness assessment requirements or our instruments are not highly effective 
if we fail to qualify for hedge accounting treatment  our operating results may suffer because losses on the derivatives we enter into may not be offset by a change in the fair value of the related hedged transaction 
if we fail to secure long term financing for a substantial portion of our net lease assets  our financial condition and operating results may suffer 
we expect to rely upon our ability to finance our net lease assets with long term indebtedness in order to generate cash proceeds for repayment of our secured warehouse lines of credit and to originate and acquire additional and other net lease assets 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will continue to be successful in securing long term financing for a substantial portion of the net lease assets that we originate or acquire 
for example  a decline in the credit quality of a tenant underlying a net lease asset investment could inhibit our ability to secure long term financing for that asset 
in the event that it is not possible or economical for us to secure long term financing for a substantial portion of our net lease assets  we may exceed our capacity under our secured warehouse credit facilities and be unable or limited in our ability to originate and acquire future net lease assets  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
if we determine that we should sell our net lease assets rather than finance them  there could be significant adverse effects on our operating results and stockholder distributions as a result of the treatment of any gains from such sales under the tax laws governing reits 
our short term financings may expose us to interest rate risks  margin calls and term risks 
our borrowings under our repurchase facility is currently at variable rates and will be adjusted monthly relative to market interest rates 
if interest rates on our borrowings rise at a faster pace than yields on our assets increase  our net interest expense will likely increase  causing our net income to decrease 
the amount available to us under our repurchase facility with wachovia bank depends in large part on the lender s valuation of the assets that secure our financings 
the facility provides wachovia bank the right  under certain circumstances  to re evaluate the collateral that secures our outstanding borrowings at any time 
in the event wachovia bank determines that the value of the collateral has decreased for example  in connection with a decline in the credit rating of the underlying tenant  it has the right to initiate a margin call 
a margin call would require us to provide wachovia bank with additional collateral or to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings at a time when we may not have a sufficient inventory of assets or cash to satisfy the margin call 
any failure by us to meet a margin call could cause us to default on our repurchase facility and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  wachovia bank has no obligation to renew our short term borrowings 
if we are unable to obtain long term financing or our shorter term financings are not renewed  our liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
the use of cdo financings with coverage tests may have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows 
we expect to purchase subordinate classes of bonds in our cdo financings 
we also expect that the terms of cdos issued by us will include coverage tests that will be used primarily to determine whether and to what extent principal and interest proceeds on the underlying assets may be used to pay principal of and interest on the subordinate classes of bonds in the cdo 
in the event the coverage tests are not satisfied  interest and principal that would otherwise be payable on the subordinate classes may be re directed to pay principal on the senior bond classes 
therefore  failure to satisfy the coverage tests could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
risks related to mortgage assets our investments in commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations are subject to losses 
when we acquire structured interests in net lease assets  we generally invest in the subordinate or interest only classes of cmbs or cdos or take a subordinate interest in the net lease asset or assets 
losses on an asset securing a mortgage loan included in a securitization or other structured interest are generally borne first by the equity holder of the property  then by a cash reserve fund or letter of credit  if any  and then by the first loss subordinated security holder 
in the event of default of an underlying asset or assets and the exhaustion of any equity support  reserve fund  letter of credit and any classes of securities or interests junior to those in which we invest  if any  we may not be able to recover our investment in the securities or structured interests we purchase 
in addition  if the underlying asset portfolio has been overvalued by the originator  or if the values subsequently decline and  as a result  less collateral is available to satisfy interest and principal payments due on the related structured interests  the structured interests in which we invest may effectively become the first loss position behind the more senior interests  which may result in significant losses to us 
the prices of lower credit quality structured interests are generally less sensitive to interest rate changes than more highly rated investments  but they are more sensitive to adverse economic downturns or individual issuer developments 
a projection of an economic downturn  for example  could cause a decline in the price of lower credit quality interests because the ability of tenants or the obligors of mortgages underlying the structured interests to make required payments may be impaired 
in such event  existing credit support in the structure may be insufficient to protect us against loss of our principal on these interests 
fluctuating interest rates may adversely affect the quantity and value of our net lease assets 
because we currently finance our net lease assets on a short term basis with variable rate financing  increases in short term interest rates may increase our net interest expense and decrease the net income generated by our net lease assets 
fluctuations in interest rates may also affect us in other ways  including that higher interest rates may reduce overall demand for net lease loans and accordingly reduce our production of loan assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results  and increases or decreases in short or long term interest rates may reduce the value of assets on our balance sheet 
we may experience losses on our mortgage loans 
we originate mortgage loans in particular  net lease loans as part of our investment strategy 
as a holder of mortgage loans  we are subject to risks of borrower defaults  tenant defaults  bankruptcies  fraud  losses and special hazard losses that may not be covered by standard hazard insurance 
also  the costs of originating  financing and hedging the mortgage loans including the debt service on cdos secured by the mortgage loans  and expenses related to the cdo transaction  including third party fees payable to trustees  servicers  document custodians  and credit enhancement providers could exceed the income on the mortgage assets 
in the event of any default under mortgage loans  we will bear the risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the mortgage collateral and the principal amount of the mortgage loan plus all interest thereon and other costs payable before principal 
to the extent we acquire subordinate cmbs or cdo interests or other subordinate structured interests in net lease assets  we will be subject to these risks in a concentrated form with respect to the underlying net lease assets 
the typical net lease requires casualty insurance which may be provided through self insurance to be maintained on the underlying property generally by the borrower or the tenant  with such coverages and in such amounts as are customarily insured against with respect to similar properties  for fire  vandalism and malicious mischief  extended coverage perils  physical loss perils  commercial general liability  flood when the underlying property is located in whole or in material part in a designated flood plain area and worker injury 
there are  however  certain types of losses such as from earthquakes or wars that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured loss occur  we could lose both our capital invested in  and anticipated profits from  one or more net lease properties 
we could be subject to the risks incident to ownership of real property if the tenants underlying our net lease loans fail to make their lease payments 
net lease loans are generally non recourse to the property owner and in the event of default the lender thereunder is entirely dependent on the loan collateral 
rent payment by the underlying tenant is the primary source of payment of these loans 
to the extent the tenant does not make its lease payments  repayment of the net lease loan will depend upon the liquidation value of the underlying real property 
the liquidation value of a commercial property may be adversely affected by risks generally incident to interests in real property  including changes in general or local economic conditions and or specific industry segments  declines in real estate values  increases in interest rates  real estate tax rates and other operating expenses including energy costs  changes in governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  including environmental legislation  acts of god  and other factors which are beyond our or our borrower s control 
there can be no assurance that our remedies with respect to the loan collateral will provide us with a recovery adequate to recover our investment 
development loans involve greater risk of loss than loans secured by income producing properties 
we expect to expand our extension of development financing to real estate developers 
these types of loans involve a higher degree of risk than long term senior mortgage loans secured by income producing real property  due to a variety of factors  including dependence for repayment on successful completion and operation of the project  difficulties in estimating construction or rehabilitation costs  loan terms that often require little or no amortization  and the possibility that a foreclosure by the holder of the senior loan could result in a substantial decrease in the value of our collateral 
accordingly  in the event of a borrower default  we may not recover some or all of our investment in our development loans 
unscheduled principal payments on our loans could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
the rate and timing of unscheduled payments and collections of principal on our net lease loans is impossible to predict accurately and will be affected by a variety of factors  including the level of prevailing interest rates  restrictions on voluntary prepayments contained in the loans  the availability of credit generally and other economic  demographic  geographic  tax and legal factors 
in general  however  if prevailing interest rates fall significantly below the interest rate on a loan  the borrower is more likely to prepay the then higher rate loan than if prevailing rates remain at or above the interest rate on the loan 
loans we originate or acquire generally prohibit prepayment or only permit prepayment in conjunction with payment of a prepayment premium to maintain the yield to investors 
our mortgage loans are typically prepayable  however  without payment of any prepayment premium  in the event of certain events of casualty or condemnation with respect to the related mortgaged property 
from time to time  we may originate a loan that is prepayable under other circumstances without payment of any prepayment premium 
we cannot assure you that our prepayment prohibitions will be enforceable in all jurisdictions in which we make loans 
further  a mortgage loan may effectively prepay in the event of a default  in which event a prepayment premium may not be recovered 
unscheduled principal prepayments could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results to the extent we are unable to reinvest the funds we receive at an equivalent or higher yield rate  if at all 
in addition  a large amount of prepayments  especially prepayments on loans with interest rates that are high relative to the rest of our portfolio  will likely decrease the net income we anticipate receiving from our assets 
we may be required to repurchase assets that we have sold or to indemnify holders of our cdos 
if any of the assets we originate or acquire and sell or pledge to obtain long term financing do not comply with representations and warranties that we make about certain characteristics of the assets  the borrowers and the underlying properties  we may be required to repurchase those assets or replace them with substitute assets 
in addition  in the case of assets that we have sold  we may be required to indemnify persons for losses or expenses incurred as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty 
repurchased assets typically require a significant allocation of working capital to carry on our books  and our ability to borrow against such assets is limited 
any significant repurchases or indemnification payments could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
the success of our net lease loan business will depend upon our ability to service effectively  or to obtain effective third party servicing for  the loans we invest in 
we have entered into a servicing arrangement with wachovia bank  na for servicing of our net lease loans 
we may in the future undertake to retain the servicing of our loan assets in a taxable subsidiary of ours 
we have no experience servicing a large portfolio of loans for an extended period of time 
we cannot assure you that our third party contractor or we will be able to service the loans according to industry standards 
failure to service the loans properly could harm our financial condition and operating results 
the success of our net lease equity business will depend on our ability to obtain third party management for the real properties we purchase 
for our equity investments in real property where the underlying lease is not a bondable or triple net lease  we typically enter into management arrangements with third parties to perform our property owner obligations 
we rely on these managers to perform our obligations under the net lease 
a failure of these managers to perform could trigger the tenant s right to terminate the lease or abate rent 
in addition  if the managers fail to perform our obligations in a cost effective manner  our net cash flows from the property and hence our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected 
an interruption in or breach of our information systems could impair our ability to originate assets on a timely basis and may result in lost business 
we rely heavily upon communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure or interruption or breach in security of our information systems or the third party information systems on which we rely could cause underwriting or other delays and could result in reduced efficiency in asset servicing 
we cannot assure you that any failures or interruptions will not occur or  if they do occur that we or the third parties on whom we rely will adequately address them 
the occurrence of any failures or interruptions could significantly harm our financial condition and operating results 
our network of independent mortgage brokers and investment sale brokers may sell our investment opportunities to our competitors 
an important source of our investments comes from independent mortgage brokers and investment sale brokers 
these brokers are not contractually obligated to do business with us 
further  our competitors also have relationships with many of these brokers and actively compete with us in our efforts to obtain investments from these brokers 
as a result  we may lose potential transactions to our competitors  which could negatively affect the volume and pricing of our investments  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we may be unsuccessful in executing our year credit tenant loan program 
like our other loan products  our year credit tenant loans are secured by a first mortgage on the underlying real estate and an absolute assignment of the underlying lease and rents 
however  we bifurcate our year credit tenant loans into two notes  a real estate note and a corporate credit note  and allocate the security among the notes 
the real estate note is entitled to a first priority claim against the underlying real estate and the corporate credit note is entitled to a first priority claim against the lease assignment 
any excess recovery on one note is paid over to the other note 
we typically sell the real estate note  which represents to of the loan  to a cmbs conduit promptly following origination and retain the corporate credit note in our portfolio 
if we are unable to continue to sell the first note  we will be subject to all risks incident to holding the debt  including the risks of borrower defaults  tenant defaults  bankruptcies  fraud  losses and special hazard losses that may not be covered by standard hazard insurance 
in addition  if the tenant underlying the loan becomes insolvent or bankrupt  that tenant or its bankruptcy trustee can reject the lease 
in such an event  our claim  as holder of the corporate credit note  against the real estate will be junior to the real estate note holder s claim 
further  while we will have a first priority claim on the lease assignment  our claim for damages will be limited to an amount defined under the bankruptcy code 
either of these contingencies could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
maintenance of our investment company act of exemption imposes limits on our operations 
we intend to continue to conduct our business in a manner that allows us to avoid registration as an investment company under the investment company act of the act 
under section c c of the act  entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate are not treated as investment companies 
the position of the sec staff generally requires us to maintain at least of our assets directly in qualifying real estate interests in order for us to rely on this exemption the requirement 
to constitute a qualifying real estate interest under this requirement  a real estate interest must meet various criteria 
mortgage securities that do not represent all of the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not qualify for purposes of the requirement 
our ownership of these mortgage securities  therefore  is limited by the provisions of the act and sec staff interpretations 
we cannot assure you that efforts to pursue our investment strategy will not be adversely affected by operation of these provisions and interpretations 
risks related to ownership of real estate our real estate investments are subject to risks particular to real property 
as an owner of real property including property securing our net lease loans that we may acquire upon foreclosure  we are subject to the risks generally incident to the ownership of the real estate 
these risks may include those listed below civil unrest  acts of god  including earthquakes  floods and other natural disasters  which may result in uninsured losses  and acts of war or terrorism  including the consequences of the terrorist attacks  such as those that occurred on september   adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions  changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of debt financing  including mortgage obligations and the possibility of foreclosure  the costs of complying or fines or damages as a result of non compliance with the americans with disabilities act and with environmental laws  changes in governmental laws and regulations  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations  fiscal policies and ordinances  costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions such as indoor mold  changes in traffic patterns and neighborhood characteristics  the potential for uninsured or underinsured property losses  the ongoing need for capital improvements  particularly in older structures  changes in real property tax rates and other operating expenses  the relative illiquidity of real estate investments  and other circumstances beyond our control 
should any of these events occur  our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
single tenant leases involve significant risks of tenant default 
we focus our real estate acquisition activities on properties that are net leased to single tenants 
therefore  a default by the sole tenant is likely to cause a significant or complete reduction in the operating cash flow generated by the property leased to that tenant and a reduction in the value of that property 
tenant defaults could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
the tenants underlying our net lease investments may default on their lease obligations 
our ability to manage our assets is also subject to federal bankruptcy laws and state laws that limit creditors rights and remedies available to real property owners to collect delinquent rents 
if a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt  we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor in possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to that tenant 
we also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises 
if a tenant becomes bankrupt  the federal bankruptcy code and possibly state laws relating to debtor relief will apply and  in some instances  may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant 
a tenant s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the ability of tenants to reject leases in a bankruptcy could adversely affect the value of our investments and our financial condition and operating results 
if the tenant underlying our net lease investments becomes insolvent or bankrupt  that tenant or its bankruptcy trustee could reject the lease 
lease enhancements do not cover risks attendant to tenant bankruptcies 
if a lease were rejected  rental payments would terminate  leaving the owner without the rental payments to support its debt service and other obligations under loans and with a claim for damages under section b of the bankruptcy code 
a claim by the owner for damages resulting from the rejection by a debtor of a lease of real property is limited to an amount equal to the rent reserved under the lease  without acceleration  for the greater of one year or percent but not more than three years of the remaining term of the lease  plus rent already due but unpaid 
there can be no assurance that any such claim for damages or any recovery on the underlying mortgaged real estate would be sufficient to provide for the repayment of amounts then due under the lease or any debt encumbering the property 
we may have obligations to comply with covenants under certain of our equity investments in real property 
under certain of our equity investments in real property  we  as owner of the property  retain obligations with respect to the property  including the responsibility for real estate taxes  insurance  operating expenses  maintenance and repair of the property  provision of adequate parking  maintenance of common areas and compliance with other affirmative covenants in the lease 
if we were to fail to meet such obligations  the tenant may be permitted to abate rent or terminate the lease  which may result in a loss of our capital invested in  and anticipated profits from  such property 
rising operating expenses could reduce our cash flow and funds available for future dividends 
our properties are subject to operating risks common to real estate in general  any or all of which may negatively affect us 
if any property is not fully occupied or if rents are being paid in an amount that is insufficient to cover operating expenses  we could be required to expend funds for that property s operating expenses 
our properties are also subject to increases in real estate and other tax rates  utility costs  operating expenses  insurance costs  repairs and maintenance and administrative expenses 
while most of our properties are subject to a net lease  renewals of leases or future leases may not be negotiated on that basis  in which event we will have to pay the expenses associated with maintaining the property 
in addition  real estate taxes on our properties and any other properties that we acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities 
many us states and localities are considering increases in their income and or property tax rates or increases in the assessments of real estate to cover revenue shortfalls 
if we are unable to lease properties on a net lease basis  or if tenants fail to pay required tax  utility and other impositions  we could be required to pay those costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to pay dividends to stockholders at historical levels or at all 
we may not be able to renew our leases or re lease our properties 
upon the expiration of leases on our properties  we may not be able to re let all or a portion of that property  or the terms of re letting including the cost of concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than current lease terms 
if we are unable to re let promptly all or a substantial portion of our properties or if the rental rates upon re letting are significantly lower than the current rates  our financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain tenants upon the expiration of their leases 
illiquidity of real estate may limit our ability to change our portfolio 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
our ability to vary our portfolio by selling and buying properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited 
in addition  the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  limits our ability to sell our properties by imposing a penalty tax of on the gain derived from prohibited transactions  which are defined as sales of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
the frequency of sales and the holding period of the property sold are two primary factors in determining whether a property sold fits within this definition 
these considerations may limit our opportunities to sell our properties 
if we must sell a property  we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of the property in the time period we desire or that the sales price of the property will recoup or exceed our cost for the property 
noncompliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
the real properties we own  including those that we may acquire by foreclosure in connection with our net lease loans  are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws 
under these laws  courts and government agencies have the authority to require the current owner of a contaminated property to clean up the property  even if the owner did not know of and was not responsible for the contamination 
for example  liability can be imposed upon a property owner based on activities of a tenant 
in addition to the costs of cleanup  environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and  therefore  an owner s ability to borrow funds using the property as collateral or to rent or sell the property 
under the environmental laws  courts and governmental agencies also have the authority to require that a person who sent waste to a waste disposal facility  such as a landfill or an incinerator  to pay for the clean up of that facility if it becomes contaminated and threatens human health or the environment 
a person that arranges for the disposal of  or transports for disposal or treatment of  a hazardous substance to a property owned by another may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of the hazardous substances released into the environment at that property 
furthermore  various court decisions have established that third parties may recover damages for injury caused by property contamination 
also  some of these environmental laws restrict the use of a property or place conditions on various activities 
an example would be laws that require a business using chemicals to manage them carefully and to notify local officials that the chemicals are being used 
we may be responsible for environmental liabilities created by our tenants irrespective of the terms of any lease 
we could be responsible for the costs discussed above 
the costs incurred to clean up a contaminated property  to defend against a claim  or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
prior to acquisition of or foreclosure on a property  we obtain phase i environmental reports and  in some cases  a phase ii environmental report 
however  these reports may not reveal all environmental conditions at a property and we may incur material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware 
future laws or regulations may impose material environmental liabilities on us or our tenants and the current environmental condition of our properties may be affected by the condition of the properties in the vicinity of our properties such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks or by third parties unrelated to us 
risks related to lease enhancements our lease enhancement mechanisms may fail 
we have developed certain lease enhancement mechanisms designed to reduce the risks inherent in our net lease investments 
these lease enhancement mechanisms include casualty and condemnation insurance policies that protect us from any right the tenant may have to terminate the underlying net lease or abate rent as a result of a casualty or condemnation  with respect to a double net lease  borrower reserve funds that protect us from any rights the tenant may have to terminate the underlying net lease or abate rent as a result of the failure of the property owner to maintain and repair the property or related common areas  and residual value insurance policies on net lease loans which have an amortization period that extends beyond the initial term of the underlying net lease  that insure against the risk that the borrower defaults and the property is worth less than the balloon balance at maturity 
these lease enhancement mechanisms may not protect us against all losses 
for example  our casualty and condemnation policies typically contain exclusions relating to war  insurrection  rebellion  revolution or civil riot and radioactive matter  earthquakes in earthquake zones and takings other than by condemnation by reason of danger to public health  public safety or the environment 
in addition  amounts in the borrower reserve fund may be insufficient to cover the cost of maintenance or repairs  and the borrower may fail to perform such maintenance or repairs at its own expense 
the failure of our lease enhancement mechanisms may result in the loss of our capital invested in  and profits anticipated from  our investment  and could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
we depend on our insurance carriers to provide and honor lease enhancements 
we presently obtain specialized lease enhancement insurance policies from two carriers 
the limited number of insurance carriers available to provide lease enhancements restricts our ability to replace such insurers 
any of the following developments with respect to our carriers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results a deterioration in our relationship with one or both of our carriers  a bankruptcy or other material adverse financial development with respect to one or both of our carriers  and a dispute as to policy coverage with one or both of our carriers 
we may fail to analyze leases adequately or apply appropriate lease enhancement mechanisms 
our net lease assets are generally secured by rent payments on the underlying net lease 
therefore  continued rent payments are critical to the value of our assets 
in determining whether a lease enhancement mechanism is appropriate  we examine the costs and benefits of the lease enhancement mechanism in light of our analysis of the risks associated with the underlying net lease 
as a result of this analysis  we may decline to apply a lease enhancement mechanism that would otherwise protect us 
our failure to analyze leases adequately or apply appropriate lease enhancement mechanisms could cause a decline in the value of our net lease asset and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
risks related to business strategy and policies we face significant competition that could harm our business 
we are subject to significant competition in seeking asset investments 
we compete with other specialty finance companies  insurance companies  investment banks  savings and loan associations  banks  mortgage bankers  mutual funds  institutional investors  pension funds  other lenders  governmental bodies and individuals and other entities  including reits 
we may face new competitors and  due to our focus on net lease properties located throughout the united states  and because many of our competitors are locally and or regionally focused  we may not encounter the same competitors in each region of the united states 
many of our competitors will have greater financial and other resources and may have other advantages over our company 
our competitors may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments  may have access to lower cost capital and may succeed in buying the assets that we target for acquisition 
we may incur costs on unsuccessful acquisitions that we will not be able to recover 
our failure to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
our ability to grow our business will be limited by our ability to attract debt or equity financing  and we may have difficulty accessing capital on attractive terms 
we expect to fund future investments primarily from debt or equity capital 
therefore  we are dependent upon our ability to attract debt or equity financing from public or institutional lenders 
the capital markets have been  and in the future may be  adversely affected by various events beyond our control  such as the united states military involvement in the middle east and elsewhere  the terrorist attacks on september   the ongoing war on terrorism by the united states and the bankruptcy of major companies  such as enron corp 
events such as an escalation in the war on terrorism  new terrorist attacks  or additional bankruptcies in the future  as well as other events beyond our control  could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital for our business 
as a reit  we will also be dependent upon the availability and cost of capital in the reit markets specifically  which can be impacted by various factors such as interest rate levels  the strength of real estate markets and investors appetite for reit investments 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting sufficient debt or equity financing to fund future investments  or at an acceptable cost 
future offerings of debt and equity may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we expect in the future to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of equity and debt securities  which would include classes of preferred stock  common stock and senior or subordinated notes 
all debt securities and other borrowings  as well as all classes of preferred stock  will be senior to our common stock in a liquidation of our company 
additional equity offerings could dilute our stockholders equity  reduce the market price of shares of our common stock  or be of preferred stock having a distribution preference that may limit our ability to make distributions on our common stock 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing or nature of additional offerings as they will depend upon market conditions and other factors 
we may fail to manage our anticipated growth 
as of december   our company had employees 
if we grow rapidly  we may experience a significant strain on our management  operational  financial and other resources 
our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to improve our operational and financial systems  to expand our employee base and train and manage our employees and to develop additional management expertise 
management of growth is especially challenging for us due to our limited financial resources 
failure to increase our business and manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
temporary investment in short term investments may adversely affect our results 
our results of operations may be adversely affected during the period in which we are implementing our investment  leveraging and hedging strategies or during any period after which we have received the proceeds of a financing or asset sale but have not invested the proceeds 
during this time  we may be invested in short term investments  including cmbs or cdo bonds  corporate bonds  commercial paper  money market funds and us agency debt 
the concentration of our company s ownership may adversely affect the ability of new investors to influence our company s policies 
as of december   our directors and executive officers owned approximately in the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
accordingly  these owners collectively have significant influence over our company and may determine to vote their shares together 
this influence may result in company decisions that may not serve the best interest of all stockholders 
our board of directors may change our investment and operational policies without stockholder consent 
our board of directors determines our investment and operational policies and may amend or revise our policies  including our policies with respect to our reit status  investment objectives  acquisitions  growth  operations  indebtedness  capitalization and distributions  or approve transactions that deviate from these policies without a vote of or notice to our stockholders 
investment and operational policy changes could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
the federal income tax laws governing reits are complex  and our failure to qualify as a reit under the federal tax laws will result in adverse tax consequences 
we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a reit under the federal income tax laws 
the reit qualification requirements are extremely complex  however  and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification as a reit are limited 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that we will be successful in qualifying as a reit 
at any time  new laws  interpretations  or court decisions may change the federal tax laws or the federal income tax consequences of our qualification as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income 
our taxable income would be determined without deducting any distributions to our stockholders 
we might need to borrow money or sell assets in order to pay any such tax 
if we cease to qualify as a reit  we no longer would be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders 
unless the federal income tax laws excused our failure to qualify as a reit  we could not re elect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit 
even if we qualify as a reit  we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow or limit our ability to sell or securitize our assets 
failure to make required distributions would subject us to tax 
in order to qualify as a reit  each year we must distribute to our stockholders at least of our taxable income  other than any net capital gain 
to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal tax laws 
under some circumstances  we may need to borrow money or sell assets to distribute enough of our taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax in a particular year 
the formation of taxable reit subsidiaries increases our overall tax liability 
our taxable reit subsidiaries will be subject to federal and state income tax on their taxable income  which will consist of gains from any loan sales and financial advisory services fees  net of the general and administrative expenses associated with these businesses 
accordingly  although our ownership of the taxable reit subsidiaries allows us to participate in additional operating income  that operating income is fully subject to corporate income tax 
the after tax net income of our taxable reit subsidiaries is available for distribution to us as dividends  but we may choose to retain earnings in the taxable reit subsidiary and not pay dividends 
we will incur a tax on transactions with our taxable reit subsidiaries that are not conducted on an arm s length basis 
the tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions  including certain methods of securitizing our loans  that would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes 
a reit s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property  other than foreclosure property  but including mortgage loans  held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
we might be subject to this tax if we were to sell a loan or securitize loans in a manner that was treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes 
therefore  in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax  we may choose not to engage in certain sales of loans other than through our taxable reit subsidiaries and may limit the structures that we utilize for our securitization transactions even though such sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial for us 
complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the sources of our income  the nature and diversification of our assets  the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock 
we may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution 
thus  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits 
complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively 
the reit provisions of the code may limit our ability to hedge our operations by requiring us to limit our income in each year from qualified hedges  together with any other income not generated from qualified real estate assets  to no more than of our gross income 
in addition  we must limit our aggregate income from non qualified hedging transactions  from our provision of services and from other non qualifying sources to no more than of our annual gross income 
as a result  we may have to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques 
this could result in greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to incur 
if we were to violate one or both of the reit gross income tests  we would be subject to a penalty tax generally equal to the greater of the amounts by which we failed the two gross income tests  multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 
if we fail to satisfy the reit gross income tests  unless our failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect  we could lose our reit status for federal income tax purposes 
our ownership limitations may restrict or prevent you from engaging in certain transfers of our common stock 
in order to maintain our reit qualification  no more than in value of our outstanding stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the federal income tax laws to include various kinds of entities during the last half of any taxable year 
to preserve our reit qualification  our charter provides that  unless exempted by our board of directors  no person may directly or indirectly own more than of the number or value whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding shares of stock 
we refer to this limitation as the aggregate stock ownership limit 
in addition  our charter provides that  unless exempted by our board of directors  no person may directly or indirectly own more than of the aggregate number or value whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
we refer to this limitation as the common stock ownership limit 
generally  any shares of our stock owned by affiliated owners will be combined for purposes of the aggregate stock ownership limit  and any shares of common stock owned by affiliated owners will be combined for purposes of the common stock ownership limit 
if anyone transfers shares in a way that would violate our ownership limits  or prevent us from continuing to qualify as a reit under the federal income tax laws  we will consider the transfer to be null and void from the outset and the intended transferee of those shares will be deemed never to have owned the shares or those shares instead will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and will be either redeemed by us or sold to a person whose ownership of the shares will not violate our ownership limits 
anyone who acquires shares in violation of our ownership limits or the other restrictions on transfer in our charter bears the risk of suffering a financial loss when the shares are redeemed or sold if the market price of our stock falls between the date of purchase and the date of redemption or sale 
provisions of our charter and maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company 
our charter contains restrictions on stock ownership and transfer 
our charter contains the aggregate stock ownership limit and the common stock ownership limit  and these restrictions on transferability and ownership may delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
our board of directors may issue additional stock without stockholder approval 
our charter authorizes our board of directors to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock we have authority to issue  without any action by the stockholders 
issuances of additional shares of stock may delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
other provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent a transaction or change of control 
our charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
for example  our charter and bylaws provide that a two thirds vote of stockholders is required to remove a director  vacancies on our board may only be filled by the remaining directors  the number of directors may be fixed only by the directors  our bylaws may only be amended by our directors and a majority of shares is required to call a special stockholders meeting 
the market price of our common stock may vary substantially 
the trading prices of equity securities issued by reits historically have been affected by changes in market interest rates 
one of the factors that may influence the price of our common stock in public trading markets is the annual yield from distributions on our common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments 
an increase in market interest rates  or a decrease in our distributions to stockholders  may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher annual yield  which could reduce the market price of our common stock

we plan to file a registration statement registering the resale of these shares in the immediate future 
upon registration of resale of these shares  the owners may freely resell the shares into the public market without restriction 
in addition  on november   an aggregate of  shares of our common stock issued to certain of our current and former employees prior to our initial public offering became eligible for sale under rule of the securities act of  as amended 
the resale of any of these shares into the public market  or the perception that such resale may occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
other factors that could affect the market price of our common stock include the following actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations  changes in market valuations of companies in the real estate or mortgage loan industries  changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts  fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes  the addition or departure of key personnel  and announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions  investments or strategic alliances
