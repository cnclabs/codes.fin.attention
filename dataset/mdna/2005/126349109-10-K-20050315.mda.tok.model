exhibit constitutes an integral part of this report  and readers are strongly encouraged to review this exhibit closely in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
market conditions of the global telecommunications industry since the vast majority of our clients operate within this industry sector  the economic state of this industry directly impacts our business 
during the time period from early through  the economic state of the global telecommunications industry deteriorated  resulting primarily from a general global economic downturn  network and plant overcapacity  and mounting debt combined with limited availability of capital 
this downward trend continued into  however to a much lesser degree than previous years 
during this time frame  many companies operating within this industry publicly reported decreased revenues and earnings  and several companies filed for bankruptcy protection 
most telecommunications companies reduced their operating costs and capital expenditures to cope with the market conditions during these times 
this resulted in a decrease in spending on business support and operation support systems aimed at helping service providers manage the increasing complexity and cost of managing the interaction between communications companies and their customers  which resulted in a decrease in demand for our customer care and billing products and services 
as of the end of  we believe the market has stabilized 
in addition  we believe the improved operating results and financial condition of many service providers are beginning to provide signs of economic improvement within this industry sector 
in addition  increased competition from non traditional telecommunication providers has accelerated the rollout of new products and services and increased the focus on customer retention 
consolidation within the industry continues  driving providers to look for additional means for leveraging their existing networks and workforce and reducing their costs 
all these events  we believe  will drive a need for scalable  flexible solutions  resulting in an improved growth outlook for the customer care and billing industry 
although we see improvements in the industry as noted above  we continue to be cautiously optimistic in our outlook  as our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating performance is highly dependent upon the pace at which the market recovers  the spending patterns of our client base  and ultimately  our success in developing and selling new products and services to new and existing clients

broadband division 
the broadband division generates its revenues by providing customer care and billing services on a service bureau basis with its core product  csg ccs bp ccs  to north american primarily the us broadband service providers  primarily for cable television  internet  and satellite television product offerings 
the market for the broadband division s products and services is highly competitive  resulting in significant pricing pressures for contract renewals 
the north american broadband industry has experienced significant consolidation over the last few years  resulting in a large percentage of the market being served by a limited number of service providers 
consistent with this market concentration  a large percentage of our broadband division s revenues are generated from a limited number of clients 
the broadband division s and our company s two largest clients in order of size are comcast corporation comcast and echostar communications echostar 
the key performance metrics for the broadband division are summarized as follows revenues increased from million in to million in the change between years relates primarily to the comcast arbitration ruling 
revenues for include a million charge to ie  reduction in revenue related to the comcast arbitration ruling  of which million was attributed to the third quarter of revenues  with the remaining attributed to revenues for periods prior to july  in addition to the payment of the arbitration award  the arbitration ruling also required that we invoice comcast for lower fees under the most favored nations mfn clause of the comcast master subscriber agreement beginning in october this had the effect of reducing quarterly revenues from comcast by approximately million million annually  when compared to amounts prior to the arbitration ruling 
in the first quarter of  we signed a new contract with comcast  which superseded the former comcast master subscriber agreement 
the pricing inherent in the new contract was consistent with that of the arbitration ruling in october segment operating expenses for totaled million  compared to segment operating expenses of million  a decrease 
the decrease between years relates primarily to the cost reduction initiatives implemented during segment contribution margin increased from million in to million in the increase relates primarily to the increase in revenues between periods  as discussed above 
non cash charges for that are included in the determination of contribution margin are stock based compensation expense of million  depreciation expense of million  and amortization of intangible assets of million  for total non cash charges of million for total domestic customer accounts processed on our system as of december  were million  compared to million as of december  the consolidated arpu for was compared to for 
table of contents other key events for the broadband division are as follows the broadband division executed the following key contracts in during the first quarter of i we signed a new customer care and billing contract with comcast  our largest client 
under the new agreement  we expect to continue to support at least a portion of comcast s video and high speed internet customers at least through december   ii we extended our customer care and billing contract with echostar  our second largest client through march   and iii we extended our statement processing agreement with cox communications for a substantial percentage of its customer base through december  during the second quarter of  we signed a new five year customer care and billing services contract with adelphia communications adelphia  which includes services related to adelphia s delivery of voice over ip services 
the adelphia services contract was subject to bankruptcy court approval  which was received during the second quarter of in conjunction with signing of this new contract  we sold  without recourse  million of adelphia pre bankruptcy accounts receivable to an independent third party for million 
after taking into consideration the amounts of our allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred revenues related to this matter  this transaction resulted in million of earnings benefit in  with million recorded as processing revenues primarily for services performed prior to the bankruptcy filing in june and million as a reduction of bad debt expense 
it has been publicly reported that one of the possible bankruptcy strategies under consideration by adelphia is to sell all or a portion of its assets 
if a sale of the assets were to occur  it is unknown at this time as to what  if any  financial impact the sale would have to our business 
during  the broadband division completed its significant architectural upgrade to ccs and related services and software products 
the acp project was initiated in and will be the broadband division s next generation product offering 
to date  we have successfully migrated approximately one fourth of the customer accounts processed on our system to this new platform  and we expect to migrate a substantial number of additional customer accounts to this platform during see the business section for additional discussion of this effort 
during  the broadband division participated in planning  testing  trials and rollouts of voice over ip services with the majority of its clients 
in january  we signed an agreement to provide voice over ip services to all of comcast s customers processed on our system  which is approximately two thirds of comcast s total customer base 
the broadband division has no material client contracts up for renewal during gss division 
the gss division is a global provider of convergent billing and customer care software and services that enables telecommunications service providers to bill their customers for existing and next generation services  including mobile  internet  wireline  cable television  and satellite 
the gss division s revenues consist of software license and maintenance revenues  and various professional and consulting services related to its software products principally implementation services 
the market for the gss division s products and services is highly competitive  resulting in significant pricing pressures for both new and existing client purchases 
for  approximately of the gss division s revenues were generated outside the us  as compared to for the key performance metrics for gss division are summarized as follows revenues remained relatively consistent between years  increasing from million in to million in segment operating expenses for totaled million  compared to segment operating expenses of million  an decrease 
the decrease between years relates primarily to the cost reduction initiatives implemented during 
table of contents segment contribution margin increased from a loss of million in to million in  a million increase 
the increase in the contribution margin between years relates primarily to lower segment operating expenses  as discussed above 
non cash charges for that are included in the determination of contribution margin are stock based compensation expense of million  depreciation expense of million  and amortization of intangible assets of million  for total non cash expenses of million for other key events for the gss division are as follows we continued our successful rollout of the kenan fx business framework since its introduction into the market in late we currently have a total of kenan fx clients 
the gss division expanded its relationships with existing clients  as well as added new clients  in every geographical region this year  including i british telecommunications  britain s largest telecommunications provider  ii bsnl  india s leading wireless provider  iii embratel  one of brazil s largest telecommunications providers  iv cantv  one of venezuela s largest telecommunications providers  v level  an international communications and information services company  and vi ctbc  a leading convergent services provider in brazil

frost sullivan  an independent industry analyst  honored csg with its product leadership award 
significant client relationships comcast background 
comcast is our largest client 
during  revenues from comcast represented approximately of our total consolidated revenues 
we expect that the percentage of our total consolidated revenues in related to comcast will represent a percentage comparable to that of arbitration resolution 
during and  we were involved in various legal proceedings with comcast  consisting principally of arbitration proceedings related to the comcast master subscriber agreement 
in october  we received the final ruling in the arbitration proceedings 
the comcast arbitration ruling included an award of million to be paid by us to comcast 
the award was based on the arbitrator s determination that we had violated the mfn clause of the comcast master subscriber agreement 
we recorded the full impact from the arbitration ruling in the third quarter of as a charge to the broadband division s revenues 
as specified in the arbitration ruling  the million was segregated such that million was attributable to periods prior to july   and million was attributable to the third quarter of of the million attributable to the third quarter of  million was attributed to processing revenues  and million was attributed to maintenance revenues 
in the fourth quarter of  we paid approximately million of the arbitration award to comcast  and in january  we paid the remaining portion of the arbitration award of approximately million 
in addition to the arbitration award  we paid to comcast interest of million  of which million was reflected as interest expense in the first quarter of in addition to the arbitration award mentioned above  the arbitration ruling also required that we invoice comcast for lower fees under the mfn clause of the master subscriber agreement beginning in october this had the effect of reducing quarterly revenues from comcast by approximately million million annually  when compared to amounts prior to the arbitration ruling 
signing of new comcast contract 
in march  we signed a new contract with comcast the comcast contract 
the comcast contract superseded the former comcast master subscriber agreement that was set to expire at the end of under the new agreement  we expect to continue to support comcast s video and high 
table of contents speed internet customers at least through december  the pricing inherent in the comcast contract was consistent with that of the arbitration ruling in october the comcast contract includes annual financial minimums for  and of million  million and million  respectively total of million 
in addition  the comcast contract eliminated the exclusive right we had under our previous contract with comcast to provide customer care and billing services for the entire million at t broadband customer base acquired by comcast in november 
although the elimination of our exclusive rights to process these customers increases the risk of customer deconversions from our system  such risk is mitigated to a certain degree by the annual financial minimums 
the comcast contract and related amendments are included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission the sec 
the documents are available on the internet and we encourage readers to review these documents for further details 
impact of comcast contract on client contracts intangible asset 
we have a long lived client contracts intangible asset related to our comcast contract that has a net carrying value as of december  of approximately million 
during the first quarter of  we evaluated the carrying value of this intangible asset in light of the net cash flows expected to be generated from the comcast contract  and concluded that there was no impairment to this asset as a result of the new comcast contract 
no events have occurred or additional facts have become available since that evaluation was performed that would cause us to change our first quarter of conclusion 
however  as a result of the shortened term of the comcast contract  effective in march  we were required to accelerate the amortization of this intangible asset 
total amortization related to the comcast contract for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
going forward  this amortization will be approximately million per quarter through the end of the contract term of december  the amortization of the client contracts intangible asset is recorded as a reduction in processing revenues  as opposed to amortization expense  in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
echostar echostar is our second largest client 
during  revenues from echostar represented approximately of our total consolidated revenues 
we expect that the percentage of our total consolidated revenues in related to echostar will represent a percentage comparable to that of in february  we extended our contract with echostar through march  the echostar master subscriber agreement and related amendments are included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with the sec 
the documents are available on the internet and we encourage readers to review these documents for further details 
issuance of convertible debt securities and irrevocable election to settle principal in cash in june  we completed an offering of million of senior subordinated convertible contingent debt securities due june  to qualified buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of we used the proceeds from the convertible debt securities  along with available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  to i repay the outstanding balance of million and terminate our credit facility our then existing bank credit facility  ii repurchase million shares of our common stock for million market price of per share from the initial purchasers of the convertible debt securities  and iii pay debt issuance costs of approximately million 
as a result of the retirement of our existing debt  we wrote off unamortized deferred financing costs attributable to the credit facility of million during the second quarter of this write off amount is reflected as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
see note to the financials statements for additional discussion of our convertible debt securities 
we issued our convertible debt securities to improve our underlying capital structure 
we believe the convertible debt securities provide the following primary benefits to our business the convertible debt securities will reduce our debt service cost 
our previous bank credit facility  which was terminated concurrently with the initial issuances of the convertible debt securities  
table of contents required principal payments through february there are no scheduled principal payments for the convertible debt securities until their maturity in  and absent a change in control  the convertible debt securities are not subject to redemption at the option of the holders until in addition  because of the convertibility feature of the convertible debt securities  we were able to issue the convertible debt securities at a lower fixed interest rate than we would have otherwise paid on senior subordinated debt with a similar maturity 
our previous bank credit facility had a floating interest rate  and at the time we issued the convertible debt securities  had an effective interest cost including deferred financing fees of approximately per annum 
the convertible debt securities have a fixed coupon rate of per annum  and have an effective interest cost including deferred financing fees of approximately per annum 
the lower overall effective interest rate will significantly reduce our required interest payments 
the issuance of the convertible debt securities allowed us to fully repay and terminate our outstanding indebtedness under our previous bank credit facility  which was senior to the convertible debt securities with an earlier maturity date and had restrictive covenants  which limited our flexibility in operating our business 
the convertible debt securities do not have similar restrictive covenants 
the convertible debt securities were structured as contingent convertible securities  meaning that holders are only permitted to convert their convertible debt securities upon specified contingencies 
under the then existing application of generally accepted accounting principles at the time of the original issuance of the convertible debt securities  the potential dilutive impact of issuing common stock upon conversion of the convertible debt securities would be excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share until one of the specified contingencies to conversion had been met  and would be included in the computation of diluted earnings per share only for the periods in which the convertible debt securities would be convertible under one of the specified contingencies to conversion 
however  as described in the following paragraph  the accounting rules for determining the potential dilutive effect of contingent convertible debt securities were changed subsequent to the issuance of our convertible debt securities 
in addition  as discussed in note to the financial statements  we derive an income tax benefit related to the convertible debt securities 
this benefit does not impact our overall effective income tax rate  but does have the effect of lowering our us federal income tax payments 
in the third quarter of  the eitf reached a final consensus decision on issue no 
eitf  the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share 
the eitf s consensus decision  which became effective in the fourth quarter of  states that shares to be potentially issued under contingently convertible instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share if dilutive regardless of whether any of the contingent conversion features have been met 
our convertible debt securities are subject to the provisions of eitf  and as a result  we adopted eitf during the fourth quarter of in conjunction with our adoption of this new accounting pronouncement  on december   we exercised an irrevocable election to settle the million principal portion of our convertible debt securities in cash upon conversion 
after such election  we may still satisfy our conversion obligation  to the extent it exceeds the principal amount  in our common stock  cash or any combination of our common stock and cash 
this irrevocable election reflects our confidence in the cash generating capabilities of our business  and allows us to use a more favorable method for determining the potentially dilutive impact of our convertible debt securities 
after exercising the irrevocable election  we were able to achieve instrument c status  as described in eitf no 
 convertible bonds with issuer option to settle for cash upon conversion  for our convertible debt securities 
instrument c status allows us to calculate dilution related to our convertible debt securities using the treasury stock method 
under the treasury stock method  we have no reduction in our previously reported earnings per diluted share in the second and third quarters of due to the adoption of eitf  and experienced no dilution for the convertible debt securities for the fourth quarter of  as our average stock price did not exceed the current effective conversion price of per share during these periods 
in future periods  the convertible debt securities will impact our diluted earnings per share calculation 
table of contents only in those periods in which our average stock price exceeds the current effective conversion price of per share 
if this irrevocable election would not have been made  we would have been required to use the if converted method in determining the potential dilution related to our convertible debt securities  which would have resulted in additional earnings per share dilution of approximately regardless of our stock price 
gss division goodwill and other long lived assets as of december   there was approximately million in net intangible assets primarily software and approximately million of goodwill that was attributed to the gss division 
we performed our annual gss division goodwill impairment test as of july   and also performed certain financial analyses of the gss division s other long lived intangible assets at that time as well  and concluded that no impairment of the gss division s goodwill or other long lived intangible assets had occurred at that time 
as of december   we concluded that no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since that time to warrant an impairment assessment of the gss division s goodwill and or other long lived intangible assets 
the gss division includes the assets from the kenan business  icms  davinci  and planet acquisitions 
key drivers of the value assigned to these acquisitions are the global telecommunications industry client base and the software assets acquired 
to date  the gss division has not achieved the financial performance that we had originally anticipated due to many factors  including the economic downturn experienced within the global telecommunications industry since we acquired these assets 
our current business plan anticipates substantial revenue and earnings growth for the gss division over the next several years 
we will continue to monitor the carrying value of the gss division s goodwill and other long lived intangible assets as we execute on our business plan to achieve this revenue and earnings growth 
we expect to perform the next gss division goodwill impairment test our annual required test in the third quarter of  unless events occur which would require an analysis earlier than that date 
if we fail to execute to our business plan due to market conditions or other business reasons  and as a result  we materially revise our gss financial projections  it is reasonably possible that a review for impairment of the gss division s goodwill and or related long lived intangible assets in the future may indicate that these assets are impaired  and the amount of impairment could be substantial 
stock based compensation expense as discussed in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  in we adopted the fair value method of accounting for our stock based awards under sfas  using the prospective method of transition outlined in sfas in addition  we completed an exchange of certain stock options for restricted stock also referred to by us as our tender offer in december as a result  our stock based compensation expense is significantly higher in when compared to and stock based compensation expense is included in the following statement of operations captions  and included in the various segment results  in the consolidated financial statements in thousands year ended december  consolidated statements of operations cost of processing and related services

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to select appropriate accounting policies  and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying our accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the most critical accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies were determined by considering our accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting policies identified relate to i revenue recognition  ii allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  iii impairment assessments of long lived assets  iv business restructurings  v loss contingencies  vi income taxes  vii business combinations and asset purchases  and viii capitalization of internal software development costs 
these critical accounting policies  as well as our other significant accounting policies  are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments that are material to our business include i collectibility assessments  ii accounting for software arrangements  and iii the use of the percentage of completion poc and the proportional performance methods of accounting 
collectibility assessments 
revenues are recognized only if we determine that the collection of the fees included in an arrangement is considered probable ie  we expect the client to pay all amounts in full when invoiced 
in making our determination of collectibility for revenue recognition purposes  we consider a number of factors depending upon the specific aspects of an arrangement  which may include  but is not limited to  the following items i an assessment of the client s specific credit worthiness  evidenced by its current financial condition and or recent operating results  credit ratings  and or a bankruptcy filing status as applicable  ii the client s current accounts receivable status and or its historical payment patterns with us as applicable  iii the economic condition of the industry in which the client conducts the majority of its business  and or iv the economic conditions and or political stability of the country or region in which the client is domiciled and or conducts the majority of its business 
the evaluation of these factors  and the ultimate determination of collectibility  requires significant judgments to be made by us 
the judgments made in this area could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
accounting for software license arrangements 
the accounting for software revenues  especially when software is sold in a multiple element arrangement  is complex and requires judgment 
key factors considered in accounting for software and related services include i the identification of the separate elements of the arrangement  ii the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  iii the assessment of whether our hosted service transactions meet the requirements of emerging issues task force issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  to be treated as a separate element to the arrangement  iv the determination of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various undelivered elements of the arrangement  v the assessment of whether the software fees are fixed or determinable  vi the determination as to whether the fees are considered collectible as discussed above  vii the assessment of whether services included in the arrangement represent significant production  customization or modification of the software  and viii the period of time maintenance services are expected to be performed 
the evaluation of these factors  and the ultimate revenue recognition decision  requires significant judgments to be made by us 
the judgments made in this area could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
in addition  because software licenses typically have little or no direct  incremental costs related to the recognition of the revenue  these judgments could also have a significant effect on our results of operations 

table of contents poc and proportional performance methods of accounting 
these methods of accounting relate primarily to our gss division 
we utilize the poc method of accounting for certain revenue arrangements involving services that require significant production  modification or customization of our software 
for other professional services arrangements  we use the proportional performance method of revenue recognition  which generally results in the recognition of a similar amount of revenue as the poc method 
under the poc proportional performance methods of accounting  revenues are typically recognized as services are performed 
we typically use hours performed on the project as the measure to determine the percentage of the work completed 
our use of the poc proportional performance methods of accounting on a project requires estimates of the total project revenues  total project costs and the expected hours necessary to complete a project 
changes in estimates as a result of additional information or experience on a project as work progresses are inherent characteristics of the poc proportional performance methods of accounting as we are exposed to various business risks in completing our projects 
the estimation process to support the poc proportional performance methods of accounting is more difficult for projects of greater length and or complexity 
factors that increase the complexity of an implementation project are discussed in more detail in exhibit in this report 
the judgments and estimates made in this area could i have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized  and or ii impact the expected profitability of a project  including whether an overall loss on a poc arrangement has occurred 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of the gss division s total recognized revenues were accounted for using the poc proportional performance methods of accounting 
to mitigate the inherent risks in using the poc proportional performance methods of accounting  we track our performance on projects and reevaluate the appropriateness of our estimates as part of our monthly accounting cycle 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on client specific allowances  as well as a general allowance 
specific allowances are maintained for clients which are determined to have a high degree of collectibility risk based on such factors  among others  as i the aging of the accounts receivable balance  ii the client s past payment experience  iii the economic condition of the industry in which the client conducts the majority of its business  iv the economic conditions and or political stability of the country or region in which the client is domiciled and or conducts the majority of its business  and v a deterioration in a client s financial condition  evidenced by weak financial condition and or continued poor operating results  reduced credit ratings  and or a bankruptcy filing 
in addition to the specific allowance  we maintain a general allowance for all our accounts receivable which are not covered by a specific allowance 
the general allowance is established based on such factors  among others  as i the total balance of the outstanding accounts receivable  including considerations of the aging categories of those accounts receivable  ii past history of uncollectible accounts receivable write offs  and iii the overall creditworthiness of the client base 
our credit risk is heightened due to our concentration of clients within the global telecommunications industry  and the fact that a large percentage of our outstanding accounts receivable are further concentrated with a limited number of clients within the broadband division 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realizability of accounts receivable 
should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of the overall allowance change significantly  an adjustment to the provision for doubtful account receivables may be necessary 
because of the overall significance of our gross billed account receivables balance million as of december   such an adjustment could be material 
impairment assessment of long lived assets 
goodwill impairment assessment 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
we have elected to do our annual test for possible impairment as of july of each year 
in addition to this annual requirement  goodwill is required to be evaluated for possible impairment on a periodic basis eg  quarterly if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment may have occurred 
under the current accounting standard  goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit which includes the goodwill is greater than the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
if it is determined that an impairment has occurred  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over its estimated fair value is recorded 

table of contents we utilize discounted cash flow models and relevant market information for comparable companies to determine fair value used in our goodwill impairment valuation 
our estimates of fair value are based upon various key assumptions such as i projected future sales  which include assumptions around market penetration and growth  and the success of any new product and service offerings  ii the profitability of future operations  iii the appropriate discount rate  and iv the identification of comparable companies 
these assumptions  by their nature  are subject to significant judgments 
changes to one of more of these assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value which could result in a future impairment of goodwill 
other long lived assets 
long lived assets eg  intangible assets  other than goodwill  are required to be evaluated for possible impairment on a periodic basis eg  quarterly if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate that a possible impairment of these assets may have occurred 
under the current accounting standard  a long lived asset is impaired if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with that asset  without consideration of interest  are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
once deemed impaired  even if by  the long lived asset is written down to its fair value which could be considerably less than the carrying amount or future undiscounted cash flows 
the determination of estimated future cash flows and  if required  the determination of the fair value of a long lived asset  are by their nature  highly subjective judgments 
changes to one of more of the assumptions utilized in such an analysis could materially affect our impairment conclusions for long lived assets 
business restructuring 
we recorded restructuring charges during  and related primarily to involuntary employee termination benefits and facilities abandonments 
our accounting for involuntary employee termination benefits generally does not require significant judgments  as we identify the specific individuals and their termination benefits in the early stages of the restructuring program  and the timing of the benefit payments is relatively short 
some judgment is needed in determining whether any legal exposure exists from the involuntary employee terminations  especially in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the initial accounting for facilities abandonments requires significant judgments in determining the restructuring charges  primarily related to the assumptions regarding the timing and the amount of proceeds from any potential sublease arrangements for the abandoned facilities 
we continually evaluate these assumptions  and adjust the related facility abandonment reserves based upon i the signing of actual sublease arrangements related to the abandoned facilities  and ii revised assumptions  caused by changes in real estate market conditions  related to abandoned facilities where there are no signed sublease arrangements 
as of december   the present value of the estimated proceeds from potential sublease arrangements ie  assumed proceeds from potential sublease agreements not covered by signed sublease arrangements was approximately million 
actual results that are significantly different from our expectations  as well as changes in our forward looking assumptions  could materially affect our restructuring reserves 
loss contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to claims and potential claims related to various items including but not limited to i legal and regulatory matters  ii client and vendor contracts  iii product and service delivery matters  and iv labor matters 
we follow the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  in determining the appropriate accounting and disclosures for such matters  which requires us to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or outcomes to these matters  as well as the potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves for such contingencies  if any  for these contingencies is based on an analysis of the issues  often with the assistance of legal counsel 
the evaluation of such issues  and our ultimate accounting and disclosure decisions  are by their nature  subject to various estimates and highly subjective judgments 
should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of any required reserves change significantly  an adjustment to the reserves may be necessary 
because of the potential significance of these issues  such an adjustment could be material 
income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each jurisdiction in which we operate  which includes both the us including both federal and state income taxes and various foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
various judgments are required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provisions for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of our business  there are certain 
table of contents transactions and calculations for which the ultimate income tax determination is uncertain 
in addition  we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities  both domestically and internationally  which could result in adverse outcomes 
for these reasons  we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest may be due 
we adjust these reserves based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of any required reserves change significantly  an adjustment to the reserves may be necessary 
because of the potential significance of these issues  such an adjustment could be material 
this process requires us to estimate the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as purchased in process r d costs  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
we must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred income tax assets will be recovered primarily from future taxable income  and to the extent recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we had net deferred income tax assets of million  relating primarily to our domestic operations  which represented approximately of our total assets 
management believes that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize the benefit of our net deferred income tax assets 
the assumption of future taxable income is  by its nature  subject to various estimates and highly subjective judgments 
business combinations and asset purchases 
accounting for business combinations and asset purchases  including the allocation of the purchase price to acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values  requires us in certain circumstances to estimate fair values for items that have no ready market or for which no independent market exists 
under such circumstances  we use our best judgment to determine a fair value based upon inference to other transactions and other data 
as a result  the amounts determined by us for such items as accounts receivable  identifiable intangible assets  goodwill  and deferred revenue are not individually the result of an arm s length transaction  but are the result of management estimates of the fair value and the allocation of the purchase price 
accordingly  revenue recognized by us related to fulfillment of assumed contractual obligations is based on fair value estimates made by us 
for larger and or more complex acquisitions  the assignment of value to individual intangible assets generally requires the use of a specialist  such as an appraiser or valuation expert 
the assumptions used in the appraisal or valuation process are forward looking  and thus subject to significant judgments and interpretations by us 
because individual intangible assets i may be expensed immediately upon acquisition eg  purchased in process r d assets  ii amortized over their estimated useful life eg  acquired software  or iii not amortized at all eg  goodwill  the assigned values could have a material impact on results of operations in current and future periods 
capitalization of internal software development costs 
we expend substantial amounts on research and development r d for both new and existing ie  enhancements software products and related services 
such costs are subject to capitalization under certain circumstances 
the determination of whether internal software r d costs are subject to capitalization is by its nature  highly subjective and involves significant judgments 
this decision could significantly affect earnings during the development period by either i capitalizing development costs  or ii expensing pre technological feasibility and pre application development stage research costs 
further  once capitalized  the software costs are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the product 
the determination of the expected useful life of a product is highly judgmental 
finally  capitalized software r d costs are subject to the same judgments when evaluating for possible impairment as discussed above for other long lived assets 
we did not capitalize any internal software r d costs  as discussed above  during the years ended december    or in addition  we do not have any capitalized internal software r d costs included in our december  and consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that during these periods no material internal software r d costs were required to be capitalized 
our conclusion is primarily based upon 
table of contents the fact that the feature rich  pre integrated  and highly scalable nature of our products requires that our development efforts include complex design  coding and testing methodologies  which include next generation software languages and development tools 
development projects of this nature carry a high degree of development risk 
substantially all of our internal software r d efforts are of this nature  and therefore  the company believes the costs subject to capitalization during these periods were not material

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  results of operations consolidated basis total revenues 
total revenues increased million  or to million in  from million in the increase between periods is primarily due to the million charge for the comcast arbitration ruling attributable to periods prior to july  recorded in the third quarter of  as discussed above 
see the results of operations operating segments section below for a detailed discussion of revenues and related changes between periods on a segment basis 
cost of processing and related services 
the cost of processing and related services revenues consists principally of i data processing and communications costs  ii statement production costs eg  labor  paper  envelopes  equipment and equipment maintenance  etc  iii client support organizations eg  client call centers  account management  etc  iv various product support organizations eg  product management and delivery  product maintenance  etc  and v facilities and infrastructure costs related to the statement production and support organizations 
the costs related to new product development including enhancements to existing products are included in research and development expenses 
the cost of processing and related services for increased to million  from million for the increase between periods is primarily due to i an increase in data processing costs  primarily due to greater processing requirements for acp functionality  and an increase in the cumulative number of our clients customer accounts processed on our system throughout the year  and ii an increase in stock based compensation expense see above for a separate discussion of stock based compensation 
the benefits from the cost reduction initiative implemented in late was principally off set by an increase in labor related costs primarily as a result of the merit wage increases in august and the increase in staff added in the latter part of to support the growth opportunities of our voice over ip products and services and migration of clients to acp 
processing costs as a percentage of related processing revenues were gross margin of for compared to gross margin of for the decrease in processing gross margin and gross margin percentage was due primarily to the lower comcast revenues in  and an increase in cost of processing services  as discussed directly above 
our gross margin percentage for processing services for the fourth quarter of was approximately 
cost of software and maintenance 
the cost of software and maintenance revenues consists principally of i amortization of acquired software and certain acquired client contracts  ii client support organizations eg  client call centers  account management  etc  iii various product support organizations eg  product management and delivery  product maintenance  etc  iv facilities and infrastructure costs related to these organizations  and v third party software costs and or royalties related to certain software products 
we do not differentiate between cost of software revenues and cost of maintenance revenues  and therefore  such costs are reported on a combined basis 
the costs related to new product development including enhancements to existing products are included in research and development expenses 
the combined cost of software and maintenance for decreased to million  from million for the decrease related primarily to a reduction in personnel and facility related costs between periods  resulting primarily from our cost reduction initiatives 
the cost of software and maintenance as a percentage of related revenues was gross margin of for as compared to gross margin of for  with the change due primarily to the decrease in expenses 
as discussed below  fluctuations in the gross margin for software and maintenance revenues are an inherent characteristic of software companies and are expected in future periods 

table of contents cost of professional services 
the cost of professional services consists principally of i our professional services organizations  ii subcontracted professional consultants  and iii facilities and infrastructure costs related to our professional services organizations 
the cost of professional services for decreased to million  from million for the decrease related primarily to a reduction in personnel and facility related costs between periods  resulting primarily from our cost reduction initiatives  offset to a certain degree by an increase in certain project specific costs eg  contractors and subcontractor costs and stock based compensation expense 
the cost of professional services as a percentage of related revenues was gross margin of for  as compared to gross margin of for the increase in the gross margin percentages between periods is due in part to an increase in revenue 
additionally  the gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by the difficulties we experienced on the proximus implementation project during  to include recording a loss accrual of million on such contract in the first quarter of gross margin 
revenues from software licenses  maintenance services and professional services make up approximately of our total revenues 
variability in quarterly revenues and operating results are inherent characteristics of companies that sell software licenses  maintenance services  and perform professional services 
our quarterly revenues for software licenses  maintenance services and professional services revenues may fluctuate  depending on various factors  including the timing of executed contracts and the delivery of contracted services or products 
see exhibit for additional discussion of factors that may cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
however  the costs associated with software and maintenance revenues  and professional services revenues are not subject to the same degree of variability ie  these costs are generally fixed in nature within a relatively short period of time  and thus  fluctuations in our software and maintenance  professional services  and overall gross margins  will likely occur between periods 
our overall gross margin for increased to million  from million for the overall gross margin percentage increased to for  compared to for the changes in the gross margin and gross margin percentage were due to the factors discussed above  principally  a result of the impact of the comcast arbitration ruling in research and development expense 
r d expense for decreased to million  from million for the decrease related primarily to a reduction in personnel costs between periods  resulting primarily from our cost reduction initiatives  offset to a certain degree by stock based compensation expense 
as a percentage of total revenues  r d expense decreased to for  from for the reason for the overall decrease in r d expense as a percentage of total revenues is due to the lower revenues in resulting from the comcast arbitration ruling 
we did not capitalize any internal software development costs during and during  we focused our development and enhancement efforts on various r d projects for the gss division  consisting principally of enhancements to the existing kenan fx product suite  as well as new software modules  and various r d projects for the broadband division  consisting principally of enhancements to ccs including acp functionalities and related broadband division software products  targeted to increase the functionalities and features of the products  including those necessary to service voice over ip product offerings 
at this time  we expect our investment in r d over time will approximate our historical investment rate of of total revenues 
we expect this investment will be focused on ccs and the kenan business product suite  as well as additional stand alone products as they are identified 
selling  general and administrative expense 
sg a expense for decreased to million  from million for the decrease in sg a expense is due to i a decrease in legal fees due to the 
table of contents comcast arbitration concluding in october such costs were approximately million for with no comparable amounts in  and to a lesser degree ii a reduction in certain personnel costs  to include the impact of the cost reduction initiatives discussed above 
these decreases were offset to a certain degree by i an increase in stock based compensation between periods of million  and ii approximately million of expense recorded in related to our executive management departures and retirements  as discussed above 
in december  we announced that neal hansen  our chairman and chief executive officer  would be retiring on june  we will record sg a expense of million related to his retirement package over the remaining service period  which began in december and ends upon his retirement on june  approximately million of this expense was recorded in the fourth quarter of  and approximately million will be recorded in the first half of the remainder of the expense will be recorded over the period from mr 
hansen s retirement date through the final payment date of january depreciation expense 
depreciation expense for all property and equipment is reflected separately in the aggregate and is not included in the cost of revenues or the other components of operating expenses 
depreciation expense for decreased to million  from million for the decrease in depreciation expense relates to a reduction in capital expenditures over the last several years in accordance with our focus on cost controls 
this decrease in capital expenditures did not have a material adverse affect on our business 
capital expenditures during were approximately million and consisted principally of i computer hardware and related equipment  ii statement production equipment  and iii facilities and internal infrastructure improvements 
restructuring charges 
our restructuring charges relate to various cost reductions initiatives implemented primarily as a result of market conditions  and the comcast arbitration ruling 
see note to the our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our cost reduction initiatives and related restructuring charges  including the current activity in accrued liabilities related to the restructuring charges 
we believe that the operational impact from these initiatives will not negatively impact our ability to service our current or future clients 
cost reduction initiatives related to market conditions in response to poor economic conditions within the global telecommunications industry  during and  we implemented several cost reduction initiatives  consisting primarily of involuntary employee terminations and facilities abandonments  with the greatest percentage of the involuntary terminations occurring within the gss division 
these cost reduction initiatives resulted in restructuring charges in both and in the aggregate  these various initiatives were targeted at reducing operating expenses by approximately million annually  based on various measurement points 
these programs were substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of cost reduction initiatives related to the comcast arbitration ruling 
in response to the expected reduction in revenues resulting from the comcast arbitration ruling  during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a cost reduction initiative 
this initiative consisted primarily of involuntary employee terminations and a reduction of costs related to certain of our employee compensation and fringe benefit programs  with the greatest percentage of the involuntary employee terminations occurring within the broadband division 
this cost reduction initiative resulted in material restructuring charges in fourth quarter of and the first quarter of this initiative was targeted at reducing operating expenses by approximately million  when compared to the third quarter annualized operating expense run rate 
this program was substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 
table of contents summary of restructuring charges 
the components of the restructuring charges included in total operating expenses  and the impact net of related estimated income tax expense these restructuring charges had on net income loss and diluted earnings per share  for the year ended december  and are as follows in thousands  except diluted earnings per share year ended december  involuntary employee terminations facilities abandonment all other total restructuring charges impact of restructuring charges on results of operations ie  have reduced operating results net income diluted earnings per share we recorded restructuring charges related to involuntary employee terminations and various facilities abandonments during and the accounting for facilities abandonment requires significant judgments in determining the restructuring charges  primarily related to the assumptions regarding the timing and the amount of any potential sublease arrangements for the abandoned facilities 
we continually evaluate these assumptions  and adjust the related facilities abandonment reserves based on the revised assumptions at that time 
in addition  we continually evaluate ways to cut our operating expenses through restructuring opportunities  to include the utilization of our workforce and current operating facilities 
during january  we executed an agreement to sublease space in our london office facility 
as a result  we will recognize a restructuring charge of approximately million at the cease use date which is expected to occur sometime during the second quarter of operating income loss 
operating income for was million  or of total revenues  compared to an operating loss of million or of total revenues for the substantial improvement in operating income between years relates to the factors described above  mainly due to the increase in revenue between years  primarily due to the impact of the comcast arbitration ruling in  and to a lesser extent  an improvement in total operating expense between years 
our total consolidated operating expenses for decreased approximately million  or  to million  when compared to million for  primarily due to the cost reduction initiatives implemented during our total operating expenses for the third and fourth quarters of were approximately million and million  respectively 
we expect our first quarter of total operating expenses to continue to trend upward and range between million to million 
the expected sequential increase in expense over the fourth quarter of relates primarily to the inclusion of approximately million of expense in the first quarter of related to mr 
hansen s retirement package  as discussed above  and an increase in stock based compensation and other personnel costs when compared to the fourth quarter of interest expense 
interest expense for decreased to million  from million for the decrease in interest expense is due primarily to the lower interest rates on the convertible debt securities  and to a lesser degree  having approximately million of interest related to the comcast arbitration award 
the weighted average balance of our long term debt for was million  compared to million for the weighted average interest rate on our debt borrowings for  including the amortization of deferred financing costs and commitment fees on our revolving credit facility  was  
table of contents compared to for the decrease in the weighted average interest rate between periods relates primarily to the issuance of our convertible debt securities in june  which have a stated coupon rate of 
our estimated interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs and commitment fees on our revolving credit facility for is approximately million 
write off of deferred financing costs 
as result of the repayment and termination of the credit facility  we wrote off unamortized deferred financing costs attributable to the credit facility of million during the second quarter of other income expense 
of the amounts recorded in this income statement caption  million and million relate to foreign currency transaction gains and losses in and  respectively 
the change between years relates primarily to the changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the us dollar against the euro and british pound 
income tax provision benefit 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million  or an effective income tax rate of approximately  compared to an income tax benefit of million  or an effective income tax rate of for the year ended december  the effective income tax rate was impacted by the net operating loss position resulting from the million comcast arbitration charge  as discussed above 
our effective income tax rate for was impacted by the completion and resolution of certain tax matters in foreign jurisdictions during see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the difference between the income tax provision benefit computed at the statutory federal income tax rate of and the financial statement provision benefit for income taxes included in our consolidated statements of operations 
at this time  we expect our effective income tax rate for to range between to 
this estimate is based on various assumptions  with the two primary assumptions related to our estimate of total pretax income  and the amounts and sources of foreign pretax income 
the actual effective income tax rate for could deviate from this estimate based on our actual experiences with these items  as well as others 
as of december   our net deferred income tax assets of million were related primarily to our domestic operations  and represented approximately of total assets 
we continue to believe that sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize the benefit of these deferred income tax assets 
our assumptions of future profitable domestic operations are supported by the strong operating performance by the broadband division over the last several years  and our future expectations of profitability 
results of operations operating segments operating segment information and corporate overhead costs for the years ended december  and  are presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
broadband division total revenues 
total broadband division revenues for increased to million  from million for the increase in total revenues was due primarily to the million charge for the comcast arbitration ruling attributable to periods prior to july  recorded in the third quarter of  as discussed above 
processing revenue 
processing revenue for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in processing revenue was due primarily to lower processing revenues from comcast as a result of the arbitration ruling in the third quarter of additional information related to processing revenues is as follows total amortization of the client contract intangible asset related to the comcast contract which is reflected as a reduction of processing revenues for and was million and million  
table of contents respectively 
the increase in amortization between years reflects the impact of the acceleration in such amortization effective with the new comcast contract in march  as discussed above 
going forward  this amortization will be approximately million per quarter through the end of the comcast contract term of december  total domestic customer accounts processed on our systems as of december  was million compared to million as of december   a decrease 
during the  a client contract was renewed in which the definition of customer billing units was modified  having the effect of lowering the customer volume counts  and customers of a dial up service provider were converted off our system  resulting in a total reduction in customer accounts processed on our system by approximately million accounts 
this reduction was off set principally by organic growth experienced by our existing clients 
consolidated processing revenues for the fourth quarter of were approximately million  almost all of which relates to the broadband division 
we expect our total consolidated processing revenues to range between million to million in the first quarter of the sequential decrease between periods relates to higher usage of ancillary products and services by our clients in the fourth quarter of due to seasonal demand  which is not expected to recur in the first quarter of the consolidated arpu was for and for  with the decrease primarily related to the reduction in comcast processing revenues in as a result of the arbitration ruling as discussed above 
our arpu for the fourth quarter of was  of which approximately was considered seasonal usage which we do not expect to recur in the first quarter of as a result  we expect our arpu to range from to for the first quarter of maintenance revenue 
maintenance revenue remained relatively flat between periods with million for compared to million for segment operating expenses and contribution margin 
broadband division operating expenses for decreased to million  from million in the overall decrease in the broadband division s operating expenses is due primarily to the fourth quarter cost reduction initiative principally a reduction in personnel costs 
these decreases were offset to a certain degree by an increase between periods in stock based compensation and an increase in data processing costs  due primarily to greater processing requirements for acp functionality and an increase in the cumulative number of our clients customer accounts processed on our system throughout the year 
broadband division contribution margin for was million contribution margin percentage of for  compared to a contribution margin of million contribution margin percentage of for the increase in the broadband division s contribution margin and contribution margin percentage between periods is primarily due to the increase in total revenue  as discussed above 
total non cash charges related to depreciation  amortization shown as a reduction of processing revenues  and stock based compensation expense included in the determination of the broadband division s contribution margin for and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in non cash charges is due primarily to the acceleration of amortization related to the comcast contract intangible asset discussed above and an increase in stock based compensation 
gss division total revenues 
total gss division revenues remained relatively consistent between periods with million for  compared to million for total gss division revenues were positively impacted by an estimated million in as a result of the weakening of the dollar against foreign currencies 
excluding the foreign currency impact  the overall decrease in total gss division revenue was due primarily to a decrease in software revenues between periods discussed in more detail below 

table of contents software revenue 
software revenue for decreased to million  from million for the decrease in software revenue was due primarily to the market conditions of the telecommunications industry 
telecommunication service providers continued to control their capital expenditures during  reducing the demand for the gss division s software products 
maintenance revenue 
maintenance revenue for increased to million  from million for the increase in maintenance revenues was due primarily to i an estimated million favorable foreign currency impact  ii the resolution of collectibility concerns for certain clients  and iii an increase in the installed software license base as a result of new sales and capacity upgrades in professional services revenue 
professional services revenue for increased to million  from million for the increase in professional services revenue was due primarily to i an estimated million favorable foreign currency impact  and ii difficulties experienced on the proximus implementation project in as discussed in greater detail below were substantially resolved in with no similar impact to professional services revenue 
segment operating expenses and contribution loss 
gss division operating expenses for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in gss division operating expenses is due primarily to a reduction in various personnel costs  to include the impact of the cost reduction initiatives implemented in this decrease was offset by an estimated million unfavorable foreign currency impact as a result of the weakening of the dollar against foreign currencies 
gss division contribution margin for was million in contribution margin of compared to a contribution loss of million in negative contribution margin of 
this improvement between years is primarily due to an overall reduction in gss division operating expenses  as discussed above 
total non cash charges related to depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense included in the determination of the gss division s contribution margin loss for and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in non cash charges is due primarily to an increase in stock based compensation 
corporate corporate operating expenses 
corporate overhead expenses for decreased to million  from million for the decrease in corporate expenses related primarily to a decrease in legal fees related to the comcast arbitration proceedings 
we incurred million of legal fees related to the comcast arbitration  with no comparable amount for the decrease is offset to a certain degree by approximately million of expense in related to executive management departures and an increase in stock based compensation of million 
total non cash charges related to depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense included in corporate operating expenses for and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in non cash charges is due primarily to an increase in stock based compensation 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  results of operations consolidated basis impact of acquisitions 
we completed our acquisition of the kenan business from lucent on february  when comparing operating results between years  results of operations include ten months of results from this acquisition  while reflects a full months of results 
we also completed our acquisition of davinci technologies inc in december  and our acquisition of the icms business from ibm in august the icms and davinci acquisitions did not individually have a material impact on the results of operations 
table of contents for the years ended december  and  and have been considered in the year over year results of operations discussed below 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions 
total revenues 
total revenues decreased million  or to million in  from million in of the million decrease  million is related to the comcast charge for arbitration ruling attributable to periods prior to july   as discussed above 
the remaining decrease between periods is due primarily to decreases in processing and related services revenues  software revenues  and professional services revenues 
see the results of operations operating segments section below for a detailed discussion of revenues and related changes between periods on a segment basis 
cost of processing and related services 
the cost of processing and related services for remained relatively unchanged between years as it was million for as compared to million for this is reflective of our continued focus on cost controls in this area 
processing costs as a percentage of related processing revenues were gross margin of for compared to gross margin of for the decrease in processing gross margin and gross margin percentage was due primarily to the lower comcast revenues during the third and fourth quarters of as a result of the arbitration ruling 
cost of software and maintenance 
the combined cost of software and maintenance for increased to million  from million for the increase related primarily to i having twelve months of kenan business operations  as compared to only ten months of kenan business operations in  and ii having twelve months of icms maintenance costs and amortization expense as compared to only four months in the cost of software and maintenance as a percentage of related revenues was gross margin of for as compared to gross margin of for  with the change due primarily to the decrease in software sales within the broadband division 
as discussed above  fluctuations in the gross margin for software and maintenance revenues are an inherent characteristic of software companies 
cost of professional services 
the cost of professional services for decreased to million from million  for the decrease related primarily to a reduction in personnel costs as a result of the cost reduction initiatives discussed above  offset by having twelve months of kenan business operations  as compared to only ten months in the cost of professional services as a percentage of related revenues was gross margin of for  as compared to gross margin of for the decrease in the gross margin percentages between periods relates primarily to i the difficulties we experienced on the large implementation project discussed in the immediately following paragraph  and ii a decrease in gss division s professional services revenues between years  which is discussed in greater detail under the results of operations operating segments below 
as part of the kenan business acquisition from lucent in  we assumed the obligation to complete a large systems implementation project for proximus  a belgium telecommunications service provider 
for the years ended december  and  respectively  we recognized revenue under this arrangement of million  and million approximately complete as of december  
this project was significantly longer and more complex than our typical implementation projects 
we experienced significant difficulties and delays in completing this project  and in the first quarter of  we announced that we expected an overall loss of approximately million on the project 
during the second quarter of  we amended the contract with this client which modified our obligations and eliminated certain performance penalties 
during the fourth quarter of  proximus went live on the system  at which time  substantially all of our implementation type obligations were completed 
although we ultimately were successful in completing the implementation phase of this project  we expended a significant amount of our professional services resources on this project in at a loss 
as a result  this project had a significant negative impact on our results of operations  in particular  our professional services revenues and related gross margin  and the gss division s overall results of operations 

table of contents gross margin 
the overall gross margin for decreased to million  from million for the overall gross margin percentage decreased to for  compared to for the changes in the gross margin and gross margin percentage were due to the factors discussed above  principally  a result of the impact of the comcast arbitration ruling and the reduction in the broadband division s software revenues 
research and development expense 
r d expense for decreased to million  from million for as a percentage of total revenues  r d expense increased to for  from for the decrease in the amount of r d expense between periods was due to i the discontinuation of the development of our csg nextgen product during the third quarter of  ii a reduction of r d costs in other areas since the second quarter of  to include a reduction of r d personnel as a result of the cost reduction initiatives discussed above  and iii the completion of the development cycle for certain projects 
prior to the kenan acquisition  the primary focus of the gss division was on the development of our nextgen software product 
following the kenan business acquisition  we discontinued the development of csg nextgen as a stand alone customer care and billing system 
the reason for the overall increase in r d expense as a percentage of total revenues is due to the lower revenues resulting from the comcast arbitration ruling  discussed above 
we did not capitalize any internal software development costs during and during  we focused our development and enhancement efforts on various r d projects for the gss division  including the kenan fx business framework see the business section of this document for additional discussion  which was introduced in late  which includes enhancements to the existing versions of the kenan business product suite  as well as new modules  and enhancements to ccs and related broadband division software products to increase the functionalities and features of the products  consisting principally of the architectural upgrade to ccs which is discussed in greater detail in the business section of this document 
selling  general and administrative expense 
sg a expense for decreased to million  from million for the decrease in sg a expense is due primarily to a decrease in bad debt expense between years of approximately million 
one of our larger broadband division clients  adelphia  filed for bankruptcy protection in june  at which time we established a reserve for the pre bankruptcy invoices 
in addition  we experienced difficulties in collecting certain international accounts receivable during  which required us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable during this time period 
the improvement in our overall accounts receivable position in the latter part of  and the fact we had no similar individual client matters in with the same degree of significance as adelphia in  allowed us to significantly reduce our bad debt expense  when compared to in addition  we were successful in collecting approximately million of purchased kenan business accounts receivable in in excess of the value assigned to such accounts receivable in our purchase accounting for the kenan business 
these collections were recorded as a reduction of sg a expense in as they occurred after we had finalized our kenan business purchase accounting 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in i legal fees related to the comcast arbitration  and ii stock based compensation expense 
we incurred million of legal fees related to the comcast arbitration and million of stock based compensation attributable to sg a in  as compared to million and million  respectively  in depreciation expense 
depreciation expense for all property and equipment is reflected separately in the aggregate and is not included in the cost of revenues or the other components of operating expenses 
depreciation expense for decreased to million  from million for the decrease in depreciation expense related to the decrease in capital expenditures made during in accordance with our focus on cost controls 
capital expenditures during were approximately million and consisted principally of i computer hardware and related equipment  ii statement production equipment  and iii facilities and internal infrastructure improvements 

table of contents kenan business acquisition related expenses 
in conjunction with the kenan business acquisition  we incurred certain direct and incremental acquisition related expenses during we completed the integration of the kenan business in  and therefore  there were no similar expenses in the acquisition related expenses included in total operating expenses  and the impact net of related income tax expense these acquisition related expenses had on net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  are presented below in thousands  except diluted earnings per share

iprd was charged to operations in the first quarter of restructuring charges 
our restructuring charges relate to various cost reductions initiatives implemented primarily as a result of market conditions  and the comcast arbitration ruling 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  and the information above  for a more detailed discussion of our cost reduction initiatives and related restructuring charges 
the components of the restructuring charges included in total operating expenses  and the impact net of related estimated income tax expense these restructuring charges had on net income loss and diluted earnings per share  for the year ended december  and are as follows in thousands  except diluted earnings per share year ended december  involuntary employee terminations facilities abandonment all other total restructuring charges impact of restructuring charges on results of operations ie  have reduced operating results net income diluted earnings per share operating income loss 
operating loss for was million  or of total revenues  compared to operating income of million or of total revenues for the decrease in these measures between years is related to the factors discussed above  principally  a result of the impact of the comcast arbitration ruling 
interest expense 
interest expense for increased to million  from million for the increase in interest expense is due primarily to approximately million of interest related to the comcast 
table of contents arbitration award  as discussed above 
in addition  the weighted average balance of our long term debt for was million  compared to million for the weighted average interest rate on our debt borrowings for  including the amortization of deferred financing costs and commitment fees on our revolving credit facility  was  compared to for other income expense 
other income for was million  compared to other expense of million for the increase was primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains during the change between years relates primarily to the changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the us dollar against the euro and british pound 
income tax provision benefit 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million  or an effective income tax rate of approximately  compared to an income tax provision of million  or an effective income tax rate of for the year ended december  the effective income tax rate for was negatively impacted by certain items recorded in conjunction with the kenan business acquisition 
as a result of the comcast arbitration charge  we were in a domestic net operating loss nol position for  and consequently  we recorded a tax benefit 
the income tax rate is impacted by the nol position for  resulting from the million comcast arbitration charge discussed above  and the resolution during of certain federal tax positions and tax refunds from certain jurisdictions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the difference between the income tax provision benefit computed at the statutory federal income tax rate of and the financial statement provision benefit for income taxes included in our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of our nol position for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax receivable of million as of december   which results from our ability to claim a refund for income taxes already paid  and from our ability to carry back our nol to prior years 
as of december   our net deferred income tax assets of million were related primarily to our domestic operations  and represented approximately of total assets 
at that time  we believed that sufficient taxable income would be generated to realize the benefit of these deferred income tax assets 
our assumptions of future profitable domestic operations were supported by the strong operating performance by the broadband division over the last several years  and our future expectations of profitability 
results of operations operating segments operating segment information and corporate overhead costs for the years ended december  and  are presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
broadband division total revenues 
total broadband division revenues for decreased to million  from million for the decrease in total revenues was due primarily to i the million comcast arbitration charge recorded in the third quarter of  ii lower revenues from comcast in the fourth quarter of as a result of the arbitration ruling  and iii a reduction in software revenues between years 
processing revenue 
processing revenue for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in processing revenue was due primarily to i the million charge for the comcast arbitration award attributed to processing revenue in the third quarter of  and ii lower revenues when compared to periods prior to the arbitration ruling from comcast in the fourth quarter of of approximately million as a result of the arbitration ruling 
total domestic customer accounts processed on our systems as of december  was million compared to million as of december   a decrease 
the arbitration ruling required us to 
table of contents measure comcast customer accounts differently for invoicing purposes beginning in october the change is primarily the result of combining the video and internet accounts for the same customer ie subscriber into a single customer account  as opposed to two separate customer accounts as was the case prior to the arbitration ruling  and to a lesser degree  not charging for certain inactive customers 
as a result  our historical breakout of video  internet  and telephony accounts is not comparable 
the december  number reflects the new basis of measurement effective october for comparability purposes  the impact of the arbitration ruling on the december  customer accounts would have resulted in total customer accounts processed of million 
the consolidated arpu was for and for  with the decrease primarily related to the reduction in comcast processing revenues in the third and fourth quarters of software revenue 
software revenue for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in software revenue was due primarily to several large software sales during  with no similar transactions in maintenance revenue 
maintenance revenue for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in maintenance revenue was due primarily to lower maintenance revenues from comcast in the third and fourth quarters of as a result of the arbitration ruling 
a small portion of the comcast arbitration award  and the corresponding reduction in fees going forward  are attributed to maintenance revenues 
segment operating expenses and contribution margin 
broadband division operating expenses were relatively unchanged between years with at million  compared to million for this is reflective of our continued focus on cost controls for this division 
the cost savings in related to the fourth quarter cost reduction initiative were not significant 
broadband division contribution margin decreased by to million contribution margin percentage of for  from million contribution margin percentage of for the broadband division s contribution margin and contribution margin percentage decreased between periods primarily due to the impact of the comcast arbitration ruling on processing revenues  and to a much lesser degree  a decrease in software revenues 
gss division total revenues 
total gss division revenues for decreased to million  as compared to million for the decrease in total revenue was due primarily to a decrease in software revenues and professional services revenues  which is discussed in more detail below 
software revenue 
software revenue for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in software revenue was due primarily to market conditions of the telecommunications industry 
telecommunication service providers continued to control their capital expenditures during  reducing the demand for the gss division s software products 
maintenance revenue 
maintenance revenue for increased by to million  from million for the increase in maintenance revenue was due primarily to a full year of kenan business maintenance revenue in  as compared to ten months of activity in in addition  during the first quarter of  we experienced some difficulties in renewing certain software maintenance agreements  and certain software maintenance agreements were renewed at lower than previous rates 
as a result  our first quarter gss division maintenance revenue decreased sequentially over the fourth quarter of by approximately million 
professional services revenue 
professional services revenue for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in revenue was due primarily to several large projects in progress during which were substantially completed in and early  without replacement of comparable projects upon completion 

table of contents segment operating expenses and contribution loss 
gss division operating expenses for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in gss division operating expenses is due primarily to cost reduction initiatives that began in the third quarter of  principally a reduction in personnel cost as a result of involuntary employee terminations  and lower bad debt expense between years 
these were partially offset by the inclusion of ten months operating expenses for the kenan business in  as compared to a full year in gss division contribution loss decreased by to million in negative contribution margin of  from million in negative contribution margin of  due primarily to a reduction in gss division operating expenses as discussed above 
corporate corporate operating expenses 
corporate overhead expenses for increased to million  from million for the increase in segment expenses related primarily to i an increase in legal fees related to the comcast arbitration proceedings  and ii an increase in stock based compensation 
we incurred million of legal fees related to the comcast arbitration and million of stock based compensation in  as compared to million and million  respectively  in liquidity cash and liquidity 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million  compared to million as of december  we generally invest our excess cash balances in low risk  short term investments to limit our exposure to market risks 
on september   we entered into a five year  million senior secured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with a syndicate of us financial institutions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the revolving credit facility has a million sub facility for standby and commercial letters of credit and a million sub facility for same day advances 
as of the date of this filing  there were no borrowings outstanding 
our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to a limitation of total indebtedness based upon the results of consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratio calculations  and a minimum liquidity requirement 
as of december   we were in compliance with the financial ratios and other covenants of the revolving credit facility  and the entire million of the revolving credit facility was available to us 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances as of the end of the indicated periods were located in the following geographical regions in thousands december  september  june  march  december  north america principally the us europe  middle east and africa principally europe asia pacific central and south america total cash  equivalents and short term investments we generally have ready access to substantially all of our cash and short term investment balances  but do face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions 
as of december   the cash and short term investments subject to such limitations were not significant 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities 
we calculate our cash flows from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  beginning with net income loss and then adding back the impact of non cash items eg  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  etc  and then factoring in the impact of changes in working capital items 
the primary use of our cash is to fund our ongoing operating activities 
of the total amount of our   and operating expenses  approximately   and relates to labor costs both employees and contracted labor for i compensation  ii related fringe benefits  and iii reimbursements for travel and entertainment expenses 
the other primary cash requirements for our operating expenses consist of i postage  ii paper and related supplies for our statement processing centers  iii data processing and related services and communication lines for our broadband division s service bureau processing business  and iv rent and related facility costs 
these items are purchased under a variety of both short term and long term contractual commitments 
see cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities below for the other primary uses of our cash 
a summary of our material contractual obligations is provided below as well 
our primary source of cash is from our operating activities 
our business model consists of a significant amount of monthly  quarterly  and annual recurring revenue sources 
the primary sources of such recurring revenues are our broadband division s long term processing arrangements billed monthly and our software maintenance arrangements primarily billed quarterly and annually  principally within the gss division 
this recurring revenue base results in a reliable and predictable source of cash for us 
in addition  software license fees and professional services revenues provide for material amounts of cash  but the payment streams for these items are not as predictable 
our net cash flows provided by used in operating activities  which consists of cash from operations and changes in working capital items  for the quarters and years ended for the indicated periods are as follows in thousands 
these amounts are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
quarters ended march june september december years ended cash flows from operations for the first quarter of reflect approximately million of favorable changes in working capital related to the comcast arbitration 
approximately million of the cash flows from operations for the second quarter of can be attributed to the sale of certain adelphia pre bankruptcy accounts receivable to a third party and to higher than normal cash collections of accounts receivable within the gss division 
the cash flow used in operating activities of million in the third quarter of relates primarily to the difficulties we experienced in collecting accounts receivable from certain of our international clients in the latter part of the cash flow used in operating activities of million in the fourth quarter of relates primarily to the million paid to comcast during the fourth quarter of as a result of the arbitration ruling 
absent this amount  we generated strong cash flows from operating activities for  primarily as a result of our improved cash collections of our international accounts receivable during the last two quarters of this improved performance allowed us to pay amounts to comcast with available corporate funds  without having to draw on our revolving credit agreement 
we believe this table illustrates our ability to consistently generate strong quarterly and annual cash flows  and the importance of managing our working capital items  in particular  timely collections of our accounts 
table of contents receivable 
absent any unusual fluctuations in working capital items  we expect our first quarter of cash flows from operating activities to range from million to million 
the key balance sheet items impacting our cash flows from operating activities are as follows 
billed accounts receivable management of our billed accounts receivable is one of the primary factors in maintaining strong quarterly cash flows from operating activities 
our billed trade accounts receivable balance includes billings for several non revenue items primarily postage  sales tax  and deferred revenue items 
as a result  we evaluate our performance in collecting our accounts receivable through our calculation of days billings outstanding dbo rather than a typical days sales outstanding dso calculation 
dbo is calculated based on the billings for the period including non revenue items divided by the average monthly net trade accounts receivable balance for the period 
our target range for our dbo is days 
our gross and net billed trade accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts receivable allowance  as of the end of the indicated periods  and our dbos for the quarters then ended  are as follows in thousands  except dbos quarters then ended in quarters then ended in gross allowance net billed dbo gross allowance net billed dbo march june september december the decrease in both the gross and net billed accounts receivable between march  and june  relates primarily to the sale of the adelphia pre bankruptcy accounts receivable to a third party  and the success we experienced collecting accounts receivable within the gss division during the second quarter of the million decrease in the allowance between march  and june  relates primarily to the sale of the aforementioned adelphia pre bankruptcy accounts receivable 
the increase in both the gross and net billed accounts receivable between september  and december  was primarily the result of the timing of new invoices and cash collections 
unbilled accounts receivable and other receivables revenue earned and recognized prior to the scheduled billing date of an item is reflected as unbilled accounts receivable 
unbilled accounts receivable are an inherent characteristic of certain software and professional services transactions and may fluctuate between quarters  as these types of transactions typically have scheduled invoicing terms over several quarters  as well as certain milestone billing events 
our unbilled accounts receivable and other receivables as of the end of the indicated periods are as follows in thousands march june september december the december  unbilled accounts receivable balance consists primarily of several projects with various milestone and contractual billing dates which have not yet been reached 
a substantial percentage of the december  unbilled accounts receivable are scheduled to be billed and collected by the end of the second quarter of however  there can be no assurances that the fees will be billed and collected within the expected time frames 

table of contents income taxes receivable we were in a domestic net operating loss nol position for as a result of the comcast million arbitration charge discussed above 
our income tax receivable as of december  was million  which resulted from our ability to claim a refund for income taxes already paid  and from our ability to carry back our nol to prior years 
during the first quarter of  we received approximately million of this income tax receivable  and identified additional income tax receivable amounts during our final preparation of our us federal income tax return  which was filed in march as a result  our december   income taxes receivable is million 
deferred revenue client payments and billed amounts due from clients in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
deferred revenue broken out by source of revenue as of the end of the indicated periods was as follows in thousands december  september  june  march  december  processing software maintenance professional services total the majority of our maintenance agreements provide for invoicing of annual maintenance fees in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of the year 
arbitration charge payable the arbitration charge payable reflected in the consolidated financial statements relates to the million comcast arbitration award discussed above 
we paid approximately million of this amount in the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of  we paid the remaining approximately million 
cash flows from investing activities 
our investing activities typically consist of purchases sales of short term investments  purchases of property and equipment  investments in client contracts and business acquisitions 
purchases sales of short term investments we generally invest our excess cash balances in low risk  short term investments to limit our exposure to market risks 
these short term investments are readily convertible back into cash 
during the year ended december   we purchased million and sold million of short term investments 
we continually evaluate the possible uses of our excess cash balances and may purchase additional short term investments in the future 
property and equipment client contracts our business is not capital intensive 
our biggest capital outlays typically relate to computer and statement production equipment 
our investment in client contracts typically consists of cash payments to clients as an incentive to bring business to our company  and direct and incremental costs that we have capitalized related to revenue arrangements where we are required to defer conversion set up services fees and recognize those fees as the related processing services are performed 
our annual capital expenditures for property and equipment  and investments in client contracts were as follows in thousands property and equipment client contracts 
table of contents as of december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures or for investments in client contracts 
business and asset acquisitions historically  our business model has not included a significant amount of business acquisition activity 
however  in order to expand our international business  in we acquired several businesses and related assets for million 
during the and  our business and asset acquisitions were not significant at million and million  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities 
we have had limited financing activities over the last several years  and historically  we have not been active in the capital markets 
our financing activities typically consist of various debt related transactions  and activities with our common stock 
long term debt during the first quarter of  we made a mandatory million prepayment which was due no later than july on our credit facility 
this payment was made with the proceeds from our million of income tax refunds received in march in june  we completed our offering of the convertible debt securities  as discussed in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we used a portion of the million of proceeds from the convertible debt securities to repay the outstanding balance of million and terminate our credit facility 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible debt securities  we incurred debt issuance costs of million 
common stock proceeds from the issuance of common stock relates to our various stock based employee compensation plans  primarily from the exercise of stock options 
the million of cash received from the issuance of common stock for the year ended december  relates primarily to the exercise of stock options in the second quarter of repurchase of common stock during the second quarter of  our board of directors approved a five million share increase in the number of shares we are authorized to repurchase under our stock repurchase program  bringing the total number of authorized shares to million 
as of december   a summary of the shares repurchased under our program is as follows in thousands  except per share amounts total shares repurchased total amount paid weighted average price per share the shares repurchased under the program are being held as treasury shares  and may possibly be used at our discretion to fulfill issuances of common stock under our various equity compensation plans 
as of december   the total remaining number of shares available for repurchase under the program totaled million shares 
subsequent to december  through the date of this filing  we have repurchased an additional million shares of common stock under the program for million weighted average price of per 
table of contents share  bringing the total remaining number of shares available for repurchase under the program as of the date of this filing to million shares 
we are currently in the process of establishing a formal plan  under the provisions of exchange act rule b  to repurchase shares of our common stock the rule b plan  and expect to have the rule b plan in place in early the b plan would allow us to have a broader period in which to conduct stock repurchases under our stock repurchase plan ie  outside the established open trading window periods 
within the terms of the proposed rule b plan  we expect to allocate up to million per quarter for common stock repurchases  and will establish target purchase volumes based upon various stock prices 
in addition to the above mentioned stock repurchases and outside of our stock repurchase program  during and  we repurchased from our employees and then cancelled approximately  shares and  shares of our common stock for million and million  respectively  in connection with minimum tax withholding requirements resulting from the vesting of restricted stock under our stock incentive plans 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  but are required to be disclosed 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash in thousands 
total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations executive severance retirement total our long term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the contractual obligation amounts reflected for our long term debt is based upon the following assumptions i our convertible debt securities are outstanding through their due date of june   ii upon settlement of the convertible debt securities  our cash obligation will not exceed the principal amount of the convertible debt securities  and iii interest paid through the life of the convertible debt securities at a rate of per annum 
the operating lease obligations are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our purchase obligations consist primarily of our expected base fees under the fdc services agreement discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  contracted services  and data communication services 
the executive severance and retirement contractual obligations are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
of the total contractual obligations and commercial commitments above  approximately million is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and approximately million is not 
capital resources we continue to make investments in client contracts  capital equipment  facilities  research and development  and at our discretion  may continue to make stock repurchases under our board approved stock repurchase program 
see the repurchase of common stock section above for additional discussion of our 
table of contents board approved stock repurchase program 
in addition  as part of our growth strategy  we are continually evaluating potential businesses and asset acquisitions 
we had no significant capital commitments as of december  the convertible debt securities bear interest at a rate of per annum  which is payable semiannually in arrears on june and december of each year 
the convertible debt securities are callable by us for cash  on or after june  the convertible debt securities can be put back to us by the holders for cash at june   and  or upon a change of control  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible debt securities  plus accrued interest 
the convertible debt securities are subject to certain conversion triggers based upon i the price of our common stock  ii the trading price of the convertible debt securities  iii us putting the convertible debt securities back to the holders  and iv the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  to include a change of control 
we do not expect any of the conversion triggers to occur during the next months 
as a result  in the near term  we expect our annual debt service costs related to the convertible debt securities to be limited to the annual interest payments of million 
the interest rate for borrowings under the revolving credit facility  except for same day advances  is chosen at our option and is based upon a base rate or adjusted libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
the base rate represents the higher of a floating prime rate and a floating rate equal to basis points in excess of the federal funds effective rate 
the interest rate for same day advances is based upon base rate  plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margins are dependent on our leverage ratio  as defined  and range from zero to basis points for base rate loans and to basis points for libor loans 
as of december   we had made no borrowings under the new revolving credit facility 
we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
this rate is dependent on our leverage ratio and ranges from to basis points per annum 
as of december   the commitment fee rate was basis points per annum 
as of december   the entire million of the revolving credit facility was available to us 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash and short term investments available to fund our operations 
we believe that our current cash and short term investments balance  together with cash expected to be generated from future operating activities and the amount available under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is computed by dividing fixed charges into earnings 
earnings is defined as income from continuing operations before income taxes  plus fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of interest expense including the amortization of deferred financing costs and the estimated interest component of rental expense 
our consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the year ended december   was  which excludes the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs of million resulting from the prepayment of our outstanding indebtedness under our then existing credit facility in june see exhibit to this document for information regarding the calculation of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges 
market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and fluctuations and changes in the market value of our short term investments 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we have not historically entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
market risk related to long term debt 
prior to june   we were exposed to changes in interest rates under our credit facility 
the interest rates for the credit facility were based on a base rate or adjusted libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
on june   in conjunction with the completion of our convertible debt securities offering  we repaid and terminated the credit facility 

table of contents the convertible debt securities are convertible into shares of our common stock under specified conditions  unless previously redeemed by us or put back to us by the holders 
the interest rate on the convertible debt securities is fixed  and thus  as it relates to our borrowings under the convertible debt securities  we are not exposed to changes in interest rates 
commencing with the six month period beginning june   we will pay contingent interest equal to of the average trading price of the convertible debt securities if the average trading price equals or more of the principal amount of the convertible debt securities 
in september  we entered into a five year  million senior secured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with a syndicate of us financial institutions 
the interest rate for borrowings under the revolving credit facility  except for same day advances  is chosen at our option  and is based upon a base rate or adjusted libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
the base rate represents the higher of a floating prime rate and a floating rate equal to basis points in excess of the federal funds effective rate 
the interest rate for same day advances is based upon base rate  plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margins are dependent on our leverage ratio  as defined  and range from zero to basis points for base rate loans and to basis points for libor loans 
as of december   we had made no borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our long term debt 
market risk related to cash equivalents and short term investments 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
our cash balances are typically swept into overnight money market accounts on a daily basis  and at times  any excess funds are invested in low risk  somewhat longer term  cash equivalent instruments and short term investments 
we have minimal market risk for our cash and cash equivalents due to the relatively short maturities of the instruments 
our short term investments as of december  were million 
currently  we utilize short term investments as a means to invest our excess cash only in the us the day to day management of our cash equivalents and short term investments in the us is done by the money management branch of one of the largest financial institutions in the us this financial institution manages our cash equivalents and short term investments based upon strict and formal investment guidelines established by us 
under these guidelines  short term investments are limited to highly liquid  short term government and corporate securities that have a credit rating of a p or better 
we do not utilize any derivative financial instruments for purposes of managing our market risks related to interest rate risk 
foreign exchange rate risk 
our approximate percentage of total revenues generated outside the us for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the increase between and in revenues generated outside the us is primarily attributable to the reduction in our revenues in the second half of as the result of the comcast arbitration ruling see the significant client relationships comcast section above 
factoring out the effect of the comcast arbitration ruling  the approximate percentage of our total revenues generated outside the us would have been 
we expect that in the foreseeable future  the percentage of our total revenues to be generated outside the us will be comparable to that of we have become more exposed to the impact of the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of the expansion of our international business with the acquisition of the kenan business in february for  approximately and  respectively  of our gss division revenues were denominated in us dollars and euros 
since a significant amount of our revenues are contracted for in us dollars  a decline in the value of local foreign currencies against the us dollar will result in our products and services being more expensive to a potential foreign buyer  and in those instances where our goods and services have already been 
table of contents sold  could result in the accounts receivable being more difficult to collect 
we do at times enter into revenue contracts that are denominated in the currency of the individual country eg  united kingdom  brazil  and japan or the european union eu where we have substantive operations 
this practice serves as a natural hedge to finance the expenses incurred in those locations 
we continue to evaluate whether we should enter into derivative financial instruments for the purposes of managing our foreign currency exchange rate risk  but as of the date of this filing  we have not entered into such instruments 
a hypothetical adverse change of in the december  exchange rates would not have a material impact upon our results of operations
