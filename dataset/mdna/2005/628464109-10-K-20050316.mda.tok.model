on july   the company announced that it was reporting to the us department of justice and the securities and exchange commission sec certain international business practices that are believed to be in violation of us and  possibly  foreign laws 
the practices  which involved a limited number of customers  related to the invoicing of certain sales to foreign customers of the company s distribution segment and sales made by a foreign subsidiary to prohibited customers in certain prohibited international jurisdictions 
these business practices have been discontinued and an investigation  which is not yet completed  is being conducted by outside counsel under the authority of the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
if the government determines that these incidents were unlawful  the government could take action against the company and or some of its employees 
the company will seek to settle any enforcement issues arising from these matters  however  at this time the company cannot reasonably estimate its potential liability and  therefore  has not recorded any provision for any resulting settlement or potential fines and penalties as of december  such amounts could be material to the company s financial statements 
the company believes that the practices in question had no effect on previously filed financial statements  and that the final findings from the investigation will not lead to any restatement of prior reported financial results since it is believed that these transactions were accurately reported in the company s financial statements 
market risk and derivative financial instruments the company has financing arrangements that require interest payments based on floating interest rates 
as such  the company s financial results are subject to changes in the market rate of interest 
our objective in managing the exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the volatility and impact of rate changes on earnings while maintaining the lowest overall borrowing cost 
at present  the company has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on any portion of its financing arrangements with floating rates 
accordingly  based on current debt levels at december   if market interest rates increase one percent  the company s interest expense would increase approximately million 
some of the company s subsidiaries operate in foreign countries and  as such  their financial results are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements 
the company believes that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations do not represent a significant market risk due to the nature of the foreign countries in which we operate  primarily canada and western europe  as well as the size of those operations relative to the total company 
the company uses certain commodities  primarily plastic resins  in its manufacturing processes 
as such  the cost of operations is subject to fluctuation as the market for these commodities changes 
the company monitors this risk but currently has no derivative contracts to hedge this risk  however  the company also has no significant purchase obligations to purchase fixed quantities of such commodities in future periods 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in the summary of significant accounting policies included in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements  the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported are affected by estimates and judgements that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
while estimates and judgements are applied in arriving at reported amounts such as pension benefits and provisions for self insured risks  we believe the following matters may involve a high degree of judgement and complexity 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns  at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
bad debts the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
additionally  the company reviews historical trends for collectibility in determining an estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for approximately percent of the company s inventories and the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
goodwill as a result of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  recorded goodwill is subjected to annual impairment testing 
goodwill impairment testing requires  in part  that we estimate the fair value of our business units which  in turn  requires that we make judgements concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates for those businesses 
our estimate of the fair value of these business units and the related goodwill  could change over time based on a variety of factors  including the actual operating performance of the underlying businesses or the impact of future events on the cost of capital and the related discount rates used 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
sfas requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency were settled for an amount greater than our estimates  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency were settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the effect of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest such earnings for an indefinite period of time 
the company has significant operations outside the united states and in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates both higher and lower than in the united states 
as a result  significant tax and treasury planning and analysis of future operations are necessary to determine the proper amounts of tax assets  liabilities and expense to be recognized 
the company has reserved the deferred tax benefit of certain tax loss carryforwards in foreign countries that  if realized  would reduce future income tax expense by approximately  of this amount   expires in various years through  and  has no expiration date 
in addition  the company has us foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which expire in item a
