the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the future operating results and performance trends of the company may be affected by a number of factors  including  without limitation  those described under risk factors below 
those risk factors  and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions identified from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission  including without limitation  its quarterly reports on form q and its registration statements  could cause the company s actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in the company s various filings with the securities and exchange commission and of changes in general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and or exchange rates and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statements 
risk factors the company s dependence on new product development and the rapid technological change that characterizes the company s industry make it susceptible to loss of market share resulting from competitors product introductions and similar risks 
the communications technology industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and rapidly changing customer requirements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its existing products  to introduce new products to meet changing customer requirements and emerging technologies  and to demonstrate the performance advantages and cost effectiveness of its products over competing products 
failure by the company to modify its products to support new alternative technologies or failure to achieve widespread customer acceptance of such modified products could cause the company to lose market share and cause its revenues to decline 
the company may experience delays in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction  and marketing of these products or product enhancements  or that its new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve any significant or sustainable degree of market acceptance in existing or additional markets 
failure by the 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk factors continued company  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the future introductions or announcements of products by the company or one of its competitors embodying new technologies or changes in industry standards or customer requirements could render the company s then existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that the introduction or announcement of new product offerings by the company or one or more of its competitors will not cause customers to defer the purchase of the company s existing products  which could cause its revenues to decline 
the company intends to continue to devote significant resources to its research and development  which  if not successful  could cause a decline in its revenues and harm its business 
the company intends to continue to devote significant resources to research and development in the coming years to enhance and develop additional products 
for the fiscal years ended   and  the company s research and development expenses comprised   and  respectively  of total net sales 
if the company is unable to develop new products as a result of its research and development efforts  or if the products the company develops are not successful  its business could be harmed 
even if the company develops new products that are accepted by its target markets  the net revenues from these products may not be sufficient to justify its investment in research and development 
a substantial portion of the company s recent development efforts have been directed toward the development of new products targeted to manufacturers of intelligent  network enabled devices and other embedded systems in various markets  including markets in which networking solutions for embedded systems have not historically been sold  such as markets for industrial automation equipment  security equipment and medical equipment 
the company s financial performance is dependent upon the development of the intelligent device markets that the company is targeting  and the company s ability to successfully compete and sell its products to manufacturers of these intelligent devices 
certain of the company s products that generate a substantial amount of its revenue are sold into mature markets  which could limit the company s ability to continue to generate revenue from these products 
certain of the company s products provide asynchronous and synchronous data transmissions via add on cards 
the market for add on asynchronous and synchronous data communications cards is mature 
furthermore  certain applications of the company s embedded network interface cards are also considered mature 
asynchronous  synchronous  and network interface cards generated approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal as the overall market for these products decreases due to the adoption of new technologies  the company expects that its revenues from these products will continue to decline 
as a result  the company s future prospects depend in large part on its ability to acquire or develop and successfully market additional products that address growth markets 
the company s failure to effectively manage product transitions could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
from time to time  the company or its competitors may announce new products  capabilities  or technologies that may replace or shorten the life cycles of the company s existing products 
announcements of currently planned or other new products may cause customers to defer or stop purchasing the company s products until new products become available 
furthermore  the introduction of new or enhanced products requires the company to manage the transition from older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk factors continued products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
the company s failure to effectively manage transitions from older products could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
the company s failure to compete successfully in its highly competitive market could result in reduced prices and loss of market share 
the market in which the company operates is characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards 
the market can be significantly affected by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants 
the company competes for customers on the basis of product performance in relation to compatibility  support  quality and reliability  product development capabilities  price  and availability 
certain of the company s competitors and potential competitors may have greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing  and personnel resources than the company 
present and future competitors may be able to identify new markets and develop products more quickly  which are superior to those developed by the company 
they may also adapt new technologies faster  devote greater resources to research and development  promote products more aggressively  and price products more competitively than the company 
there are no assurances that competition will not intensify or that the company will be able to compete effectively in the markets in which the company competes 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry may result in substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results 
the company s semiconductor products provide networking capabilities for intelligent  network enabled devices and other embedded systems 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and subject to rapid technological change and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints 
as a result  the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions 
loss of one or more of the company s key customers could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues 
tech data and ingram micro  distributors  comprised and of net sales  respectively  during the fiscal year ended during fiscal and tech data comprised and of net sales  respectively  and ingram micro comprised and of net sales  respectively 
the potential loss of distributors tech data and ingram micro would have less impact than if end user customers were lost 
the company s sales are primarily made on the basis of purchase orders rather than under long term agreements  and therefore  any customer could cease purchasing the company s products at any time without penalty 
the decision of any key customer to cease using the company s products or a material decline in the number of units purchased by a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues 
the long and variable sales cycle for certain of the company s products makes it more difficult for the company to predict its operating results and manage its business 
the sale of the company s products typically involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by potential customers and end users  as well as delays frequently associated with end users internal procedures to deploy new technologies within their products and to test and accept new 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk factors continued technologies 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle associated with certain of the company s products is typically lengthy and is subject to a number of significant risks  including end users internal purchasing reviews  that are beyond the company s control 
because of the lengthy sales cycle and the large size of certain customer orders  if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  the company s operating results for that quarter could be materially adversely affected 
the company depends on manufacturing relationships and on limited source suppliers  and any disruptions in these relationships may cause damage to the company s customer relationships 
the company procures all parts and certain services involved in the production of its products and subcontracts most of its product manufacturing to outside firms that specialize in such services 
although most of the components of the company s products are available from multiple vendors  the company has several single source supplier relationships  either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s suppliers will be able to meet the company s future requirements for products and components in a timely fashion 
in addition  the availability of many of these components to the company is dependent in part on the company s ability to provide its suppliers with accurate forecasts of its future requirements 
delays or lost sales could be caused by other factors beyond the company s control  including late deliveries by vendors of components 
if the company is required to identify alternative suppliers for any of its required components  qualification and pre production periods could be lengthy and may cause an increase in component costs and delays in providing products to customers 
any extended interruption in the supply of any of the key components currently obtained from limited sources could disrupt the company s operations and have a material adverse effect on the company s customer relationships and profitability 
the company s use of suppliers in southeast asia involves risks that could negatively impact the company 
the company uses suppliers in southeast asia 
product delivery times may be extended due to the distances involved  requiring more lead time in ordering 
in addition  ocean freight delays may occur as a result of labor problems  weather delays or expediting and customs issues 
any extended delay in receipt of the component parts could eliminate anticipated cost savings and have a material adverse effect on the company s customer relationships and profitability 
the company s ability to compete could be jeopardized if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company s ability to compete depends in part on its proprietary rights and technology 
its proprietary rights and technology are protected by a combination of copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and patents 
the company enters into confidentiality agreements with all employees  and sometimes with its customers and potential customers  and limits access to the distribution of its proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company in this regard will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of its technology 
the company s pending patent applications may be denied and any patents  once issued  may be circumvented by the company s competitors 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are superior to the company s technologies 
despite the company s efforts to protect 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk factors continued its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of its products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate or that competing companies will not independently develop similar technology 
the company s failure to adequately protect its proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on the company s competitive position and result in loss of revenue 
from time to time  the company is subject to claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights or other claims  which could seriously harm the company and require the company to incur significant costs 
the communications technology industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
from time to time  the company receives notification of a third party claim that its products infringe other intellectual property rights 
any litigation to determine the validity of third party infringement claims  whether or not determined in the company s favor or settled by the company  may be costly and divert the efforts and attention of the company s management and technical personnel from productive tasks  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to operate its business and service the needs of its customers 
there can be no assurance that any infringement claims by third parties  if proven to have merit  will not materially adversely affect the company s business or financial condition 
in the event of an adverse ruling in any such matter  the company may be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or be required to obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement 
there can be no assurance that a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any limitations on the company s ability to market its products  or delays and costs associated with redesigning its products or payments of license fees to third parties  or any failure by the company to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition 
see item and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company faces risks associated with its international operations and expansion that could impair its ability to grow its revenues abroad 
in the fiscal years ended september    and  net sales to customers outside the united states were approximately   and  respectively  of total net sales 
the company believes that its future growth is dependent in part upon its ability to increase sales in international markets 
these sales are subject to a variety of risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs  import restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and potentially adverse tax consequences  and export license requirements 
in addition  the company is subject to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally  including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business strategy and financial condition 
if the company loses key personnel it could prevent the company from executing its business strategy 
the company s business and prospects depend to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of its executive officers and its key technical personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk factors continued no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could result in the company s failure to execute its business strategy 
unanticipated changes in the company s tax rates could affect its future results 
the company s future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation 
in addition  the company may be subject to the examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other us and international tax authorities 
the company regularly assesses the potential outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an effect on the company s consolidated operating results and financial condition 
any acquisitions the company has made or will make could disrupt its business and seriously harm its financial condition 
the company will continue to consider acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
in the event of any future purchases  the company could issue stock that would dilute the company s current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  assume liabilities  or incur large and immediate write offs 
the company s operation of any acquired business may also involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies  or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from the company s core business  difficulties integrating businesses in different countries and cultures  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which the company has no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organization 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies  or personnel that the company has acquired or that the company might acquire in the future and any failure to do so could disrupt its business and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  from time to time the company may enter into negotiations for a proposed acquisition  but be unable or unwilling to consummate the acquisition under consideration 
this could cause significant diversion of management s attention and out of pocket expenses to the company 
the company could also be exposed to litigation as a result of an unconsummated acquisition  including claims that it failed to negotiate in good faith or misappropriated confidential information 
the company s failure to effectively comply with the requirements of applicable environmental legislation and regulation could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the company to environmental and other regulations 
in addition  certain states and countries may pass regulations requiring the company s products to meet certain requirements to use environmentally friendly components 
such laws and regulations have recently been passed in jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the european union has issued two

the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive weee makes producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment financially responsible for collection  reuse  recycling  treatment and disposal of equipment placed in the european union market after august  the restrictions of hazardous substances directive rohs bans the use of certain hazardous materials in electric and electrical equipment which are put on the market in the european union after july  in the future  china and other countries are expected to adopt environmental compliance programs 
if the company fails to comply with these regulations  it may not be able to sell its products in jurisdictions where these regulations apply which could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
non gaap financial measures management believes that there are certain non gaap financial measures that provide useful information to investors regarding the company s results of operations and financial condition which permit a more meaningful comparison and understanding of the company s operating performance 
these non gaap financial measures are discussed in the letter to stockholders and the income taxes section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
these non gaap financial measures are as follows earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebtda  income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change excluding unusual items  earnings per diluted share  excluding the impact of the favorable tax settlement with respect to the measures that exclude the favorable tax settlement  management believes that excluding this item provides useful information to investors regarding the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition and permits a more meaningful comparison and understanding of the company s operating performance 
management believes that ebtda helps investors compare operating results and corporate performance exclusive of the impact of the company s capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
in addition  the incentive compensation plans for the company s employees  including executive officers  are partially based on achievement of defined earnings before taxes  depreciation and amortization targets  and the company monitors this statistic on a quarterly basis 
management uses these various non gaap measures to monitor and evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and to gain an understanding of the comparative operating performance of the company 
the company does not consider the non gaap financial measures listed above to be substitutes for performance measured in accordance with gaap 
investors should also view the gaap measures as the most complete measure of the company s overall financial performance

digi also placed a high priority on improving the company s total operating expense to net sales ratio which was in fiscal compared to and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
innovative new product introductions  together with a focus on simplifying infrastructure to improve operational efficiencies and a cost containment focus throughout the company  created a strong increase in operating income to of net sales in fiscal compared to and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company operates in two reportable segments  the connectivity solutions segment and the device networking solutions segment see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the connectivity solutions segment includes products that are mature and are in flat to declining markets as well as products that have recently been introduced and are in growing markets 
declining sales of products in the mature product lines within this segment were offset by increasing sales of growth products in this segment  resulting in a million increase in sales levels in fiscal compared to fiscal and a million increase in sales levels in fiscal compared to fiscal although total sales in the connectivity solutions segment increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  operating income in 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued this segment declined in fiscal relative to the prior year as the continuing decline in net sales of the multi port serial adapter products resulted in a reduction in margins 
improved margins and lower operating expenses resulted in an increase in connectivity solutions segment operating income during fiscal compared to fiscal the company s strategy is to focus on key applications  customers and markets to efficiently manage the migration from mature products and applications to other newer technologies 
the company expects continued long term growth in the device networking solutions segment 
net sales in the device networking solutions segment increased during the three year period ended september  increased net sales as a result of the rabbit and fs forth acquisitions resulted in a decrease in operating loss during fiscal compared to fiscal higher revenue and lower operating costs offset a decline in gross profit margins resulting in a decrease in operating loss during fiscal compared to fiscal the company believes the complementary nature of the device networking products  along with a line of embeddable modules  enhanced by product additions resulting from the rabbit and fs forth acquisitions  will provide an expanded range of products and technology in the future and will allow customers to migrate from an external box to a board or module and eventually to a fully integrated chip without making major changes to their software platforms 
as digi continues to work toward its objective of seamless migration for its customers through connectivity technologies  with a goal of maintaining its leadership position in commercial grade device networking  the segments described above are being reevaluated 
this evaluation results from the migration of core technology across product lines  as well as changes in the company s infrastructure that affects the way management views and assesses its business 
the company is considering a change to a single reporting segment in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of this reevaluation 
the company intends to continue to extend its current product lines with next generation commercial grade device networking products and technologies targeted for selected commercial markets  such as point of sale  industrial automation  office automation  building controls and medical 
the company believes that there is a market trend of device connectivity in these commercial applications that will require communications intelligence or connectivity to the network or the internet 
these devices will be used for basic data communications  management  monitoring and control  and maintenance 
the company believes that it is well positioned to leverage its current products and technologies to take advantage of this market trend

accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
at the time of acquisition  rabbit had a development project in process for the rabbit microprocessor 
the project involved the design and development of a next generation microprocessor that would have increased code execution speed  reduced code size  added security features  and integrated ethernet capabilities 
management estimated that million of the purchase price represented the fair value of acquired in process research and development related to the rabbit microprocessor that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
this amount was expensed as a non tax deductible charge upon consummation of the acquisition 
the company utilized the income valuation approach to determine the estimated fair value of the acquired in process research and development 
these estimates were based on the following assumptions the estimated revenues were based upon the company s estimate of revenue growth over the next six fiscal years  or the estimated life cycle of the rabbit microprocessor  using the assumption that all revenue recorded after that date will be generated from future technologies 
the estimated gross margin was based upon historical gross margin for rabbit s products  with an increase over time attributable to production synergies 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued acquired in process research and development continued the estimated selling  general and administrative expenses were based on consideration of historical operating expenses as a percentage of sales and rabbit s projected operating expenses 
the company believes that projected cash flows for in process research and development technologies are generally of higher variability and risk than existing technologies and this was considered in determining an appropriate rate of return by which to discount the cash flows generated by in process research and development 
the company anticipates that the rabbit microprocessor will be released in march these estimates described above are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur

interest expense was million in fiscal primarily related to interest expense on the million short term loan that was used to finance the rabbit acquisition and interest on capital leases and a revolving line of credit held by rabbit 
the short term loan was paid in full in july other expense was million in both fiscal and fiscal total other income  net was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company realized interest income on marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents of million in both fiscal and fiscal higher average cash and marketable securities balances in fiscal compared to fiscal offset the impact of lower average interest rates during comparable periods

income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal in february  the congressional joint committee on taxation approved a settlement with the internal revenue service on an audit of certain of the company s prior fiscal years income tax returns 
the company had established tax reserves in excess of the ultimate settled amounts 
as a result  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal representing the excess of its income tax reserves over the amount paid 
the estimated annual effective rate for fiscal  adjusted for the million favorable tax settlement  would have been 
the effective tax rate for both fiscal and fiscal is lower than the 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income taxes continued us statutory rate of primarily due to utilization of income tax credits and exclusions for extraterritorial income 
the effective tax rate for fiscal  excluding the million income tax benefit  is higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal as a result of higher income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change  lower tax credits and exclusions for extraterritorial income  and non deductible rabbit acquisition costs 
the company s effective income tax rate was in fiscal the negative effective rate in fiscal is due to the reversal of the valuation allowance associated with the german net operating loss carryforwards based upon current and anticipated future taxable income generated by the company s german operations 
the portion of the valuation allowance related to the german net operating loss carryforwards that was expected to be utilized by the company during the year ended september  was accounted for by reducing the effective income tax rate in fiscal the portion of the valuation allowance related to the german net operating loss carryforwards that was expected to be utilized by the company during periods subsequent to september  resulted in an income tax benefit of million being recorded as a discrete event during fiscal the effective rate for fiscal  adjusted for the million valuation allowance reversal  would have been 
the tax provision for fiscal  adjusted for the million valuation allowance reversal  is recorded at a rate less than the us statutory rate primarily due to an exclusion for extraterritorial income  utilization of income tax credits  and the effect of an increase in acquired deferred tax assets resulting from available netsilicon net operating losses 
the effective tax rate  excluding the million favorable tax settlement in fiscal and the million valuation allowance reversal in fiscal are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
management believes that excluding these one time non recurring items provides useful information to investors regarding the company s effective tax rate in comparison to the us statutory rate 
the reconciliation of this measure to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is disclosed in the non gaap financial measures section of this report 
as of september   the company had domestic federal net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire at various dates through all of the million of net operating loss carryforwards and approximately million of tax credit carryforwards relate to the netsilicon acquisition and are subject to annual use limitations of million  in accordance with provisions of the internal revenue code 
the company is required to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance against those assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes fas 
the company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized based on future projected taxable income and the anticipated future reversal of deferred tax liabilities  and therefore no valuation allowance has been established at september  the amount of the net deferred tax assets realized  however  could vary if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the amounts of future taxable income 
if the company s future taxable income projections are not realized  a valuation allowance would be required  and would be reflected as income tax expense at the time that any such change in future taxable income is determined 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and related change in accounting principle as discussed more fully in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company adopted the provisions of fas as of october  at which time it was determined that there was a total goodwill impairment of million 
the company recorded this charge in the first quarter of fiscal the charge was attributable to an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill related to three acquisitions  primarily that of netsilicon 
the impairment resulted from significant changes in the company s expected future cash flows that resulted from a decline in anticipated future revenues due both to the general downturn in the worldwide economy and to a severe downturn in the networking communications and semiconductor industries 
as a result of the downturn in expected future revenues and a substantial decline in the company s market capitalization during  the indicated fair values of the company s reporting units had declined substantially since the acquisitions 
the charge was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
there was no income tax effect associated with this impairment charge 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june  and a discounted cash flow technique was utilized in determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
since the calculated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded book value  there was no impairment identified 
goodwill of million is recorded on the company s balance sheet as of september  inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations or on its financial position 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations principally with funds generated from operations 
at september   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million compared to million at september  the company s working capital decreased million to million at september   compared to million at september  working capital increased million in fiscal from million at september  to million at september  net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million during fiscal the decline in net cash provided by operating activities of million between comparable fiscal years ended september  and is primarily the result of a payment of million to the irs in november due to the settlement on an audit of certain of the company s income tax returns for prior fiscal years 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million during fiscal fiscal net income of million along with non cash charges including depreciation and amortization expense of million and a million tax benefit related to stock options exercises were the primary factors that resulted in net cash provided by operating activities of million 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million during fiscal non cash charges including a goodwill impairment charge of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million and a provision for inventory obsolescence of million reduced the effect of the fiscal net loss of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal compared to net cash used in investing activities of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  the company paid million and million for the acquisitions of rabbit and fs forth  respectively 
net settlements from marketable securities were million in fiscal compared to net

purchases of property  equipment  improvements and certain other intangible assets were million in both fiscal and fiscal and million in fiscal the company also used million in fiscal and for contingent purchase price payments related to acquisitions 
the company generated million from financing activities in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to cash received from the exercise of stock option and employee stock purchase plans of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the company entered into a million short term loan during the third quarter of fiscal to finance the rabbit acquisition 
the company determined that it was more economical to borrow funds to finance the rabbit acquisition than to liquidate marketable securities prior to their scheduled maturities 
this short term loan was repaid in fiscal during fiscal  the company used million for financing activities  primarily due to the use of million to repurchase  shares of its common stock from sorrento networks corporation 
additionally  the company elected to pay the remaining million of long term debt obligations originally scheduled to be paid in semi annual principal installments through december  these payments in fiscal were partially offset by borrowings under a new short term borrowing agreement with sparkasse dortmund in the amount of million 
this borrowing was repaid in january the company s management believes that current financial resources  cash generated from operations and the company s potential capacity for debt and or equity financing will be sufficient to fund its business operations for the foreseeable future 
the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at september  however  this table excludes up to of additional purchase consideration that may be payable to fs forth in installments of million on october  and million on october  if fs forth achieves certain future milestones 
payments due by fiscal period less than in thousands total year years years thereafter operating leases short term loan capital leases total contractual cash obligations the lease obligations summarized above relate to various operating lease agreements for office space and equipment and have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of million due in the future under noncancellable subleases 
foreign currency the majority of the company s foreign currency transactions are executed in the us dollar  euro or japanese yen 
as a result  the company is exposed to foreign currency transaction risk associated with certain sales transactions being denominated in euros or japanese yen and foreign currency translation risk as the financial position and operating results of the company s foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
the company has not implemented a hedging strategy to reduce foreign currency risk

recent accounting developments in december  the fasb issued fas r which replaces fas and supersedes apb this standard requires the recognition of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
under this statement  the company must measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and the cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide the service usually the vesting period 
in april the sec delayed the effective date of fas r and as a result  the company has adopted the provisions of this standard beginning october  the company expects that the standard will result in an increase in compensation expense which will result in a reduction to net income and net income per common share 
the adoption of this standard is expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the values of purchased assets and assumed liabilities in acquisitions 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of products to its distributors and oem customers  and to a lesser extent from the sale of software licenses  fees associated with technical support  training  professional and engineering services  and royalties 
the company recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and there are no post delivery obligations other than warranty 
under these criteria  product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product to customers 
sales to authorized domestic distributors and oems are made with certain rights of return and price adjustment provisions 
estimated reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments are established by the company based on an analysis of historical patterns of returns and price adjustments as well as an analysis of authorized returns compared to received returns  current on hand inventory at distributors  and distribution sales for the current 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued revenue recognition continued period 
estimated reserves for future returns and price adjustments are charged against revenues in the same period as the corresponding sales are recorded 
material differences between the historical trends used to determine estimated reserves and actual returns and pricing adjustments could result in a material change to the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the company has applied consistent methodologies for estimating reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments for all years presented 
the reserve for future returns and pricing adjustments was million at september  compared to million at september  in fiscal and fiscal the company offered rebates to authorized domestic distributors 
no such rebates were offered in fiscal the rebates were incurred based on key metrics and the level of sales the respective distributors made to end user customers and were charged to operations as a reduction in revenue in the same period as the corresponding sales 
the company also generates revenue from the sale of software and licenses  post contract customer support  fees associated with technical support  training  professional and engineering services  and royalties 
revenue recognized resulting from such non product sales represented of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal  and of net sales in fiscal the company s software development tools and developments boards often include multiple elements  including hardware  software and licenses  post contract customer support  limited training and basic hardware design review 
the company s customers purchase these products and services during their product development process in which they use the tools to build network connectivity into the devices they are manufacturing 
revenue for software licenses and professional and engineering services is recognized upon performance  which includes delivery of a final product version and acceptance by the customer 
for post contract support and fees associated with technical support  revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the contract as service is performed 
royalty revenue is recognized when cash is received from the customer 
unearned post contract customer support and unearned nonrecurring engineering services revenue is included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects the estimate of losses that may result from the inability of some of the company s customers to make required payments 
the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on known circumstances regarding collectibility of customer accounts and historical collections experience 
if the financial condition of one or more of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material differences between the historical trends used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts and actual collection experience could result in a material change to the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
as of september  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million compared to million at september  inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
the company reduces the carrying value of its inventories for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
if actual product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued inventory continued required that could result in a material change to the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the company has applied consistent methodologies for the net realizable value of inventories 
the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at september  and  respectively 
identifiable intangible assets purchased proven technology  customer relationships  license agreements  covenants not to compete and other identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value when acquired in a business acquisition  or at cost when not purchased in a business combination 
purchased in process research and development costs ipr d are expensed upon consummation of the related business acquisition 
all other identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to thirteen years 
useful lives for identifiable intangible assets are estimated at the time of acquisition based on the periods of time from which the company expects to derive benefits from the identifiable intangible assets 
methods of amortization reflect the pattern in which the asset is consumed 
in accordance with fas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  identifiable intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset s undiscounted expected future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value amount 
the company measures impairment loss by utilizing an undiscounted cash flow valuation technique using fair values indicated by the income approach 
impairment losses  if any  are recorded currently 
to the extent that the company s undiscounted future cash flows were to decline substantially  such an impairment charge could result 
there are certain assumptions inherent in projecting the recoverability of the company s identifiable intangible assets 
if actual experience differs from the assumptions made the consolidated results of operations or financial position of the company could be materially impacted 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and is not amortized 
however  in accordance with fas no 
 goodwill is subject to an impairment assessment at least annually which may result in a charge to operations if the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill is reported declines 
there are certain assumptions inherent in projecting the fair value of goodwill 
significant assumptions include the company s estimates of future cash flows and the cost of capital 
these and other estimates are based upon information that the company uses to prepare its annual and five year business plan projections 
if actual experience differs from the assumptions made the consolidated results of operations or financial position of the company could be materially impacted 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june  utilizing a discounted cash flow technique and determined that there was no impairment 
goodwill of million is recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of september  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on fas the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities actually realized could be impacted by differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the amounts of future taxable income 
if management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance would be required  and would be reflected as income tax expense at the time that any such change in estimated future taxable income is determined 
the company has determined that a valuation allowance is not required as of september  tax credits are accounted for under the flow through method  which recognizes the benefit in the year in which the credit is utilized 
the company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the us and outside of the us accordingly  the company must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
this determination requires the company to make several estimates and assumptions 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income  and other complex issues  may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in adjustments to the company s income tax balances that are material to the consolidated financial position and results of operations 
during fiscal  the company adjusted its income tax reserves by million following a settlement with the internal revenue service see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
investments are made in accordance with the company s investment policy and consist of high grade commercial paper and corporate bonds 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate risk as all investments are held to maturity and the majority of the company s investments mature in less than a year 
foreign currency risk the company is exposed to foreign currency transaction risk associated with certain sales transactions being denominated in euros or japanese yen and foreign currency translation risk as the financial position and operating results of the company s foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
the company has not implemented a hedging strategy to reduce foreign currency risk 
during  the average monthly exchange rate for the euro to the us dollar increased by approximately from to and the average monthly exchange rate for the japanese yen to the us dollar increased by approximately from 
to 
a change from the average exchange rate for the euro and yen to the us dollar would have resulted in a increase or decrease in annual net sales and a increase or decrease in stockholders equity 
the above analysis does not take into consideration any pricing adjustments the company may need to consider in response to changes in the exchange rate
