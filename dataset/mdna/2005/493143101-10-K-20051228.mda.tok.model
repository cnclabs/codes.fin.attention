overview sales for the year ended september  were million compared with million for fiscal the company reported net earnings for fiscal of million  or per diluted share  compared with net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal gross margins were lower in fiscal versus fiscal because of a change in the mix of products sold from the prior year 
export and international sales for the fiscal years ended september   and accounted for  and of net sales in each year  respectively 
export sales are expected to increase as a percentage of sales 
the company believes there is significant potential for increased sales of its products outside the united states where sorting and inspection equipment is not as widely adopted as in the us in  the company focused its effort on three major initiatives to achieve its long term revenue growth plan expand and grow its participation in the pharmaceutical market  continue to drive growth in the company s aftermarket product lines  strengthen and grow the level of business in china 
the results from reflected progress on each of these initiatives 
the pharmaceutical initiative focused on the formation of the symetix business unit during fiscal this business unit was formed to dedicate a team of employees to develop and grow key s business in the pharmaceutical market 
a new optical inspection system for high resolution inspections of solid dose pharmaceuticals called vantyx was launched during the year 
this new product 
table of contents extends and advances the company s existing patented  high resolution inspection technology and material handling platforms 
the company also further developed its aftermarket product lines and introduced its new g family of products with enhanced vision engine technology 
upgrades are an important aspect of the aftermarket product lines  and the new modular g product family  which provides advanced image processing capability  has been well received by the company s current customers 
aftermarket sales in fiscal increased substantially over fiscal  and the introduction of additional new products and extensions of current technology are expected to permit the company to further increase its aftermarket business in fiscal the company has been successful in selling tobacco sorters in china 
larger opportunities exist there in the food processing business  and the company is planning further investments in china to enhance sales  service and applications support to build upon its established base 
in february  the company acquired freshline machines pty 
ltd 
as a platform to launch its entry into the fresh cut market 
management continues to see opportunity in this growing market 
the path for is to continue to build upon our direction and solid base that the company developed during the focus for the coming year is to continue to grow the pharmaceutical business  continue to increase revenues in the aftermarket business  and to further increase the company s local presence in china by locating company personnel in country 
the company will also continue to seek investments which will allow it to extend its penetration into other markets and to add products which are complementary to its existing business 
restatement of financial statements the company recently made adjustments in its accounting for deferred rent credits that will require a restatement of the company s financial statements for the second and third fiscal quarters of fiscal ended march  and june   respectively 
as a result of these adjustments  previously issued unaudited quarterly data may not agree to the annual amounts 
see item a of this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies the company has identified its critical accounting policies  the application of which may materially affect the financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require management judgment to make estimates and assumptions in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which will be settled in the future 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates which management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts valuation of inventories long lived assets allowances for warranties accounting for income taxes management has discussed the development  selection and related disclosures of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
additionally  the company sells its goods on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically shipping point  port of loading or port of discharge  depending on the final destination of the goods 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which occurs either upon shipment by the company or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the 
table of contents terms of sale 
revenue earned from services maintenance  installation support  and repairs is recognized ratably over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
if any contract provides for both equipment and services multiple deliverables  the sales price is allocated to the various elements based on objective evidence of fair value 
each element is then evaluated for revenue recognition based on the previously described criteria 
the company s sales arrangements provide for no other  or insignificant  post shipment obligations 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  the company defers revenue recognition 
in the event of revenue deferral  the sale value is not recorded as revenue to the company  accounts receivable are reduced by any amounts owed by the customer  and the cost of the goods or services deferred is carried in inventory 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates whether an allowance for sales returns is necessary 
historically  the company has experienced few sales returns 
if the company believes there are potential sales returns  the company will provide any necessary provision against sales 
in accordance with the financial accounting standard board s emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s product  we account for cash consideration such as sales incentives that we give to our customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that we can identify and for which we can reasonably estimate the fair value 
the company believes that revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate because the company s terms of sale vary significantly  and management exercises judgment in determining whether to recognize or defer revenue based on those terms 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
at september   the company had deferred million of revenue compared to million deferred at september  allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  doubtful accounts based on credit profiles of customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and customers historical payment patterns 
factors that affect collectibility of receivables include general economic or political factors in certain countries that affect the ability of customers to meet current obligations 
the company actively manages its credit risk by utilizing an independent credit rating and reporting service  by requiring certain percentages of down payments  and by requiring secured forms of payment for customers with uncertain credit profiles or located in certain countries 
forms of secured payment could include irrevocable letters of credit  bank guarantees  third party leasing arrangements or ex im bank guarantees  each utilizing uniform commercial code filings  or the like  with governmental entities where possible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to allowances for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management judgment in making assumptions relative to customer or general economic factors that are outside the company s control 
as of september   the balance sheet included allowances for doubtful accounts of  actual charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
accruals for bad debt expense for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
if the company experiences actual bad debt expense in excess of estimates  or if estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  the carrying value of accounts receivable would decrease and charges for bad debts would increase  resulting in decreased net earnings 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company s inventory includes purchased raw materials  manufactured components  purchased components  work in process  finished goods and demonstration equipment 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventories are made after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are the company s purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles and the associated product support 
the company actively manages its exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining low safety stocks and minimum purchase lots  utilizing just in time purchasing practices  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing to sales to production to after sale support 
at september   cumulative inventory adjustments to lower of cost or market totaled million compared to million as of september  amounts charged to expense for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
actual charges to the reserve were  and  for fiscal and 
table of contents  respectively 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs  and a decrease to gross margins 
long lived assets 
the company regularly reviews all of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  investments in joint ventures  and amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of these assets  an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets is recorded 
in addition  goodwill is reviewed based on its fair value at least annually 
as of september   the company held million of property  plant and equipment  investments in joint ventures  goodwill and other intangible assets  net of depreciation and amortization 
there were no changes in the company s long lived assets that would result in an adjustment of the carrying value for these assets 
estimates of future cash flows arising from the utilization of these long lived assets and estimated useful lives associated with the assets are critical to the assessment of recoverability and fair values 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to long lived assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generated throughout the lives of several product lines over extended periods of time  and the potential effect that recognizing an impairment could have on the assets reported on the company s balance sheet and the potential material adverse effect on reported earnings or loss 
changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment  which would result in a reduction to the carrying value and a reduction to net earnings in the affected period 
allowances for warranties 
the company s products are covered by warranty plans that extend between days and years  depending upon the product and contractual terms of sale 
the company establishes allowances for warranties for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  warranty claims based on contractual terms  product conditions and actual warranty experience by product line 
company products include both manufactured and purchased components and  therefore  warranty plans include third party sourced parts which may not be covered by the third party manufacturer s warranty 
ultimately  the warranty experience of the company is directly attributable to the quality of its products 
the company actively manages its quality program by using a structured product introduction plan  process monitoring techniques utilizing statistical process controls  vendor quality metrics  a quality training curriculum for every employee and feedback loops to communicate warranty claims to designers and engineers for remediation in future production 
warranty expense has varied widely in the past due to such factors as significant new product introductions containing defects and design errors on individual projects 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to allowances for warranties is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to significant fluctuation period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future warranty claims relative to potential unknown issues arising in both existing and new products  which assumptions are derived from historical trends of known or resolved issues  and risks associated with third party supplied components being manufactured using processes that the company does not control 
as of september   the balance sheet included warranty reserves of million  while million of warranty charges were incurred during the fiscal year then ended  compared to warranty reserves of  as of september  and warranty charges of million for the fiscal year then ended 
if the company s actual warranty costs are higher than estimates  future warranty plan coverages are different  or estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  reserves for warranty would need to increase  warranty expense would increase and gross margins would decrease 
accounting for income taxes 
the company s provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of management judgment 
the quarterly provision for income taxes is based partially upon estimates of pre tax financial accounting income for the full year and is affected by various differences between financial accounting income and taxable income 
judgment is also applied in determining whether the deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
in management s judgment  when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers  will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
there was no valuation allowance at september  due to anticipated utilization of all the deferred tax assets as the company believes it will have sufficient taxable income combined with the lengthy expiration periods on carryforward items to utilize these assets 
the company maintains reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
these tax jurisdictions include federal  state and various international tax jurisdictions 
potential income tax exposures include potential challenges of various tax credits  export related tax benefits  and issues specific to state and local tax 
table of contents jurisdictions 
exposures are typically settled primarily through audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause management of the company to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
during fiscal   and  there have been no significant changes in these estimates 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures  however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
during the fiscal year ended september   income tax expense was reduced by approximately  due primarily to changes in tax laws which re characterized previously non deductible items 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because it relies on significant management judgment in making assumptions relative to temporary and permanent timing differences of tax effects  estimates of future earnings  prospective application of changing tax laws in multiple jurisdictions  and the resulting ability to utilize tax assets at those future dates 
if the company s operating results were to fall short of expectations  thereby affecting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of the valuation allowance required to be included in the financial statements established in any given period 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance would reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  increase tax expense and reduce net earnings 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was enacted 
this legislation phases out the extra territorial income exclusion eti beginning january  through december  the eti exclusion reduced the company s effective tax rate by  and in  and  respectively 
the legislation also provides for a new deduction for manufacturing income  which phases in beginning in the company s fiscal year through although final regulations have not been written for the new manufacturing income deduction  the company anticipates that this deduction will largely  if not completely  offset the loss of the eti exclusion 
however  the effects in individual fiscal years during the phase in periods may vary and increase the company s effective tax rate during these periods 
the company does not believe that other provisions of the new legislation will have a material effect on the company s income taxes

the primary reason for the decrease in automated systems sales was the decline in shipments of tegra  which experienced a decrease in orders as a result of a cyclical decline in the domestic processed vegetable market  the major market for this product 
an order for tobacco sorters to be delivered to china did not ship prior to year end  further affecting the decrease in the automated inspection 
table of contents business 
the reduction in automated inspection system sales was offset by increases in process system sales and parts and service contracts sales 
process systems increased to million and of net sales in fiscal from million and of net sales in fiscal shipments were up in fiscal across all products within the process systems product line and benefited from the acquisition of freshline machines pty 
ltd 
in fiscal freshline extends the company s capacities into the fresh cut market segment of the food processing market 
one of the major initiatives during was the focus on aftermarket sales 
the increased focus on parts service contracts led to an increase in net sales to million in fiscal from million in fiscal parts and service contracts increased to of net sales from in the primary reason for the increase was additional shipments of upgrades which increased in over the prior year 
the addition of the g upgrade kit introduced during fiscal is expected to give added emphasis to this product category in the g platform standardizes the electro optical components across all of the company s sorting product lines and allows customers to upgrade an application module instead of replacing an entire sorter 
gross profits decreased in due primarily to the mix of products sold during the year 
process systems  which carry the lowest gross margins  increased in percent of total sales from to as noted above 
the automated inspection systems product line  which carries a higher gross margin as a percentage of sales  saw its share of revenues drop from of net sales to 
this change in mix between product lines caused gross margin dollars to drop to million in fiscal from million the prior year 
the gross margin percentage decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal reflecting the product mix change 
the gross margin was also adversely affected in the fourth quarter by a  charge to fully accrue for a product performance issue  which ultimately resulted in a sales concession to a customer 
research and development spending decreased from year to year  dropping to million and of net sales in fiscal from million and of net sales in fiscal the decrease in spending reflects the reduction in workforce and spending controls implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company continues to invest in r d to continue the extension of its product lines and development of new products 
sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly from the prior year 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal expenditures for sales and marketing totaled million during the first half of  but increased to million in the second half of the year as expenses were incurred related to the initiatives to grow the aftermarket business and to increase the company s presence in china 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal versus million in fiscal general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from the year prior 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal due to hiring and relocation costs incurred  consulting fees  stock compensation expenses recorded  and costs incurred in connection with an abandoned acquisition 
other income and expense improved from  of expense in fiscal to  of expense in fiscal interest income was higher by  in fiscal  while interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to lower borrowings  offset slightly by higher interest rates in subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company s us term debt aggregating million was paid from cash on hand 
in  the company entered into an agreement with peco controls corporation to form inspx llc  a joint venture 
the financial results of the joint venture resulted in a million charge to other expense in  including costs for amortization of patents 
in november  the company received a one time settlement of  related to the resolution of a dispute with a licensee over a breach of the licensing agreement which was included in other income in fiscal the effective tax rate for the company was in fiscal compared to in fiscal due to permanent differences arising from extra territorial income exclusions  research and development tax credits and other permanent differences  the effective tax rates varies from the federal statutory tax rate 

table of contents net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal were million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal the principal reasons for the reduced net earnings for fiscal compared to fiscal were lower operating margins related to product mix as described above 
in fiscal  the company will begin to account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r see future accounting changes 
although the effects of adopting this standard have not been fully quantified  the company estimates that it will increase expenses in fiscal in the range of  to  before income taxes for incentive stock options 
in addition  the company will expense a full year of its restricted stock compensation  which expense is estimated to be approximately million to million before income taxes  based on the price of our common stock as of september  fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased to million in fiscal  down million from million in fiscal sales declined in the company s automated inspection systems product line  primarily in the tobacco sorter product line 
contributors to the decline were local competition in china and a strategy change by one of our customers to push product inspection down to its local suppliers 
partially offsetting the decline in tobacco sorters was increased sales in the combined optyx prism lines 
net sales in the company s process systems product line declined in fiscal with reductions appearing in its vibratory lines both in the us and in europe 
sales of parts and service grew on a year over year basis due to increased demand for upgrades and a growth in parts sales 
service sales also showed an improvement year over year of 
gross profit decreased million to million in fiscal from million in gross profit as a percent of sales  however  improved from in to in the dollar decrease is attributable to the volume drop in process systems which also had a slight decrease in gross profit as a percent of sales 
the company s automated inspection systems  while reflecting an overall volume drop from fiscal  delivered improved gross profit margin percentages  particularly in the tegra and optyx product lines 
tobacco sorters  though lower in sales volume  also delivered higher gross profit margins 
partially offsetting the volume drop in process systems and automated inspection systems  aftermarket parts and service sales showed volume improvement with resulting gross profit contribution 
also affecting gross profit for fiscal was a price increase in stainless steel  which is used in many of the company s product lines 
although protected somewhat by supply contracts  the higher stainless steel prices resulted in higher component costs and reduced margins on certain product lines by approximately million 
operating expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and represented and of net sales in each year  respectively 
the principal components of operating expenses are sales and marketing expense  research and development expense and general and administrative expense 
as part of a strategy to grow revenues and expand into new market segments  the company has increased its investment in marketing and product management  spending million in fiscal compared to in fiscal commission expense also increased million year over year as a result of a higher volume of equipment sold through independent sales representatives as opposed to the company s direct sales force 
research and development spending for the year increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company continues to invest in research and development  introducing several new products during the fiscal year 
new products introduced during the year were the kpi key package inspector for the tobacco industry  the adrc for the french fry industry  a multi split product handling system for the fruit industry  a new mechanical size grading approach in vegetable processing  and the g vision engine that has much greater computer processing capacity and speed than prior generation engines 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal were negatively affected by million invested in implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
although the work is largely completed for the documentation phase  the company expects to incur continued expenses as it enters into the testing and maintenance phase of the program 
also affecting the year was a reduction to the company s work force that occurred in late september resulting in a charge of approximately million 

table of contents other income and expense includes interest income and expense  income or expense from the company s inspx joint venture  royalty income and other income or expense from miscellaneous sources 
total other income and expense reflected million expense in fiscal compared to million expense in fiscal interest income increased to  in fiscal compared to  in the prior year due to the company s short term investment of excess cash throughout the year 
interest expense for the period dropped by  reflecting lower interest bearing debt levels and an interest rate reduction 
in july  the company entered into an agreement with peco controls corporation to form inspx llc  a joint venture 
the financial results of the joint venture resulted in a  charge to other expense for fiscal including  for amortization of patents 
the company s effective income tax rate was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate varies from the statutory rate of due to permanent differences arising from extra territorial income exclusions  research and development tax credits  and other permanent differences  plus the inclusion of the effective state income tax rate 
net earnings for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal the principal reasons for the reduced net earnings of fiscal compared to fiscal were lower business volume and increased operating expenses as described above 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million 
net income generated million and non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization provided million and million respectively 
higher business levels at the end of versus resulted in increased accruals and liabilities reflective of the increased business activity 
these increases included higher accounts payable  million  accrued customer support and warranty  million  and other accrued liabilities  million 
the higher level of business activity at the end of is also reflected in the higher amounts of trade accounts receivable  which increased million over the prior year end 
inventories were higher by million  which primarily reflects the tobacco sorter which had been produced but not shipped to a customer in china prior to year end 
cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal the acquisition of freshline machines pty

used million in cash and the purchase of machinery and equipment used million 
the company acquired million in assets related to the freshline purchase and assumed million in liabilities 
cash used in financing activities totaled million in fiscal cash used for the redemption of series b preferred stock and the redemption of warrants was million and million  respectively 
the company also made debt payments which reduced the company s long term debt by million 
these applications of cash were partially offset by the receipt of million due to the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options 
accounts receivable increased million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal receivables older than days and those with extended terms grew by million 
this increase in older receivables reflects the increase in international shipments during because of longer shipment times and special banking requirements associated with foreign shipments  collection of those accounts takes longer and extended payment terms are often granted for those shipments 
inventories increased by million  or  totaling million and million at the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increases were primarily in work in process and finished goods 
the increase in work in process reflects the higher level of production activity at the end of versus due to the higher level of orders in the fourth quarter of versus the prior year 
the increase in finished goods was related to a tobacco sorter order for a chinese customer 
the company normally carries a relatively small amount of finished goods inventory 
the increases in work in process and finished goods were partially offset by a reduction in raw materials and parts

the credit facility also restricts the payment of dividends 
at september   the company was in compliance with all loan covenants 
at september   borrowings under the term loan were million and there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
subsequent to year end  the term loan was paid in full from available cash 
at september   borrowings under the term loan were million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at september  additionally  the company s credit accommodation with a commercial bank in the netherlands provides a credit facility for its european subsidiary 
this credit accommodation totals million and includes term loans of  an operating line of the lesser of million or the available borrowing base  which is based on varying percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventories  and a bank guarantee facility of million 
the term loans require quarterly principal payments of  and mature in october and august the term loans are secured by real property of the company s european subsidiary  while the operating line and bank guarantee facility are secured by all of the subsidiary s personal property 
the credit facility bears interest at the bank s prime rate  with a minimum of  plus 
at september   the interest rate was 
interest rates on the term loans are subject to annual renegotiation 
at september   the company had borrowings under this facility of approximately  in term loans  and had received bank guarantees of  under this agreement 
the company anticipates that the ongoing cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under currently available operating credit lines will be sufficient to fund the company s operating needs for at least the next twelve months 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in the last three years  respectively 
this operating cash flow has allowed the company to fund capital asset purchases  significantly reduce the long term debt outstanding and redeem the preferred stock and associated warrants 
the company anticipates that its cash needs will continued to be met from cash from operations as it embarks on its initiatives to grow the pharmaceutical and aftermarket businesses and expand its china operation 
the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures at september  prior years fiscal and during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million 
cash flow from operating activities was derived from net earnings before non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  of million 
these cash flows were offset by increases in non cash working capital of million 
these increases were primarily due to a reduction of million in customer deposits caused by a reduced customer order backlog at september  versus september  working capital also increased as a result of a reduction of million in accrued payroll liabilities primarily from the payment of profit sharing and other employee incentive plans which were accrued as of the end of fiscal and paid in fiscal these increases in working capital were partially offset by reductions of inventory of million due primarily to inventory management activity that reflected the reduced backlog at september  compared to the prior year end 

table of contents cash flow from operating activities in fiscal was million lower than in fiscal the reduction in cash flow from operations was largely the result of a million reduction in earnings from continuing operations before tax combined with a million increase in cash paid for taxes  as the company was able to utilize fewer nol carryforwards in fiscal while non cash working capital changes provided million of cash in fiscal  non cash working capital changes required cash of million in fiscal  a million net change 
this change was largely driven by changes in customer deposits  which totaled million at september  compared to million at september  and changes in accrued payroll  as discussed above 
these changes in working capital were offset by the timing of collections  as accounts receivable decreased only million while sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal decreased million 
net cash resources used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal in july  the company invested million in the inspx joint venture 
the company s acquisition of capital equipment was million with offsetting cash from the sale of capital equipment of million
