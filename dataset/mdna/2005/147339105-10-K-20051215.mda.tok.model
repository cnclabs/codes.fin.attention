item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of financial statements subsequent to the issuance of the financial statements for the year ended september   management determined that the company s deferred income tax liabilities were not correctly stated as of september     and further  the company s provision for deferred income taxes was not correctly stated for the years ended september    and under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
as a result  beginning retained earnings  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows have been restated 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for a summary of the effects of these changes on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of september   as well as on the company s consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income  shareholders equity and cash flows for fiscal year the accompanying management s discussion and analysis gives effect to these corrections 
the following is management s assessment of the company s financial condition and a discussion of the principal factors that affect consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years ended september    and references herein to   and refer to these fiscal years 
overview the company is a local distribution company ldc serving approximately  customers in the states of washington and oregon 
its service area consists primarily of relatively small cities and rural communities rather than larger urban areas 
the company s primary source of revenue and operating margin is the distribution of natural gas to end use residential  commercial  industrial  and institutional customers 
revenues are also derived from providing gas management and other services to some of its large industrial and commercial customers 
the company s rates and practices are regulated by the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc and the oregon public utility commission opuc 
key elements of the company s strategy remain focused on the natural gas distribution business 
pursue appropriate regulatory treatment  including initiatives to decouple the company s earnings from changing customer consumption patterns  and remove other regulatory impediments to effective management of the business 
economic expansion of its customer base by prudently managing capital expenditures and ensuring new customers provide sufficient margins for an appropriate return on the new investment required to acquire the customers 
continue to focus on operational efficiencies 
manage cash flow to avoid the requirement of additional debt financing 
opportunities and challenges the company operates in a diverse service territory over a wide geographic area relative to the company s overall size and number of customers 
the economies of various parts of the service area are supported by a variety of industries and are affected by the conditions that impact those industries 
management believes there are growth opportunities in the company s service area  especially in the residential and commercial segments 
factors contributing to these opportunities include low market penetration in many of the towns served  and general population growth in the service area  including some areas of rapid growth 
overall revenues and margins are also negatively impacted by higher efficiency in new home and commercial building construction  higher efficiency in gas burning equipment  and customers taking additional measures to reduce energy usage 
the increasing cost of energy in recent years  including the wholesale cost of natural gas  continues to encourage such measures 
the company continues to believe that energy efficiency and conservation are the most viable near term tactics for influencing the wholesale natural gas prices 
it s also a vital strategy for stabilizing the cost of gas over the long term 
the traditional regulatory establishment of rates ties the recovery of cost to volumetric sales 
this traditional rate design creates a financial disincentive for utilities to promote conservation 
the company is working with regulators and other stakeholders in each state to develop an acceptable decoupling mechanism that will enable the company to promote conservation while still earning an adequate return on its invested capital and operating costs 
similar approaches have been implemented in many states and are endorsed by a variety of organizations  including the recent endorsement by the national association of regulated utility commissions 
the results of such rate requests and other initiatives for regulatory relief are subject to significant uncertainties 
the company earns approximately one third of its operating margin from industrial and electric generation customers 
loss of major industrial customers  or unfavorable conditions affecting an industry segment  could have a detrimental impact on the company s earnings 
many external factors over which the company has no control can significantly impact the amount of gas consumed by industrial and electric generation customers and  consequently  the margins earned by the company 
revenues and margins from the company s residential and small commercial customers are highly weather sensitive 
in a cold year  the company s earnings are boosted by the effects of the weather  and conversely in a warm year  the company s earnings suffer 
peak requirements also drive the need to reinforce our systems ie  increase capacity 
our operations group considers innovative approaches such as temporarily utilizing mobile gas supply rather than making large investments in long term capacity increases  which may not be fully utilized 
prospects for continuing strong residential and commercial customer growth are excellent 
the pace of new home and commercial construction remains steady in communities served by the company 
good potential also exists for converting homes and businesses located on or near the company s current lines to gas from other fuels  as well as for expanding the system into adjacent areas 
customer count growth in this sector has been about double the average of us gas utilities 
our customer service call center organization recently voted to accept union representation 
the company plans to negotiate an agreement that will support our effort to cost effectively provide superior customer service 
the timing and results of negotiations are uncertain 
the contract with the union representing our service mechanics and construction staff expires on april  again  we plan to negotiate an agreement that supports superior and cost effective customer service 
the results and timing of negotiations are uncertain 
we continue to pursue operating efficiencies and cost reductions 
during fiscal  we completed the implementation of automated meter reading capability covering our entire service area 
this reduced our staffing needs by full time equivalent positions 
during fiscal  the centralization of our customer service activities and organization reductions  enabled by a variety of other improvements  reduced our staffing by over 
our current organization is able to service more customers at a lower cost than in prior years 
changes completed during fiscal alone resulted in improving our customer per employee ratio from to we continue to look for additional operating improvements 
as discussed in item our description of the business  we carefully analyze the economics of our spending to support growth 
when justified under our tariffs  we work with developers  business owners and residents to share certain construction costs to assure a fair return to cascade 
non revenue generating spending is also managed to assure that we use the most economically attractive solutions while providing for a safe and reliable system 
management continuously seeks improvement opportunities in all areas 
our discussion above covering regulatory change  labor relations  operating practices  our organization and our investment to maintain and expand our gas delivery system are examples 
we will continue to evaluate these and other aspects of our business to improve our customer service and the returns to our shareholders 
results of operations versus the company reported net income for of  or per share  compared to  or per share for references herein to per share earnings refer to both basic and diluted  unless otherwise indicated 
primary factors resulting in the decrease in earnings per share include operating margin factors reduced natural gas usage per residential and commercial customer per share lower margin from gas management services per share unfavorable comparison of mark to market valuations versus per share lower margins from deliveries to industrial customers per share cost of operations factors executive transition costs associated with changes in the chief executive officer and chief financial officer per share severance compensation associated with staffing reductions per share increased depreciation expenses per share write offs of cancelled projects per share increased purchased services expenses per share increased uncollectible accounts expenses per share the above unfavorable comparisons were partially offset by the following factors increase in the number of residential and commercial customers per share revision of estimated liability for oregon earnings sharing per share lower employee benefits expense per share versus the company reported net income for of  or per share  compared to  or per share for primary factors and the resulting increase decrease in earnings per share affecting this comparison include improved margins from residential and commercial customers related to increased per customer consumption and growth in the number of customers per share reduction in employee benefit expenses resulting from the successful implementation of plan changes designed to reduce costs per share recognition in of retirement plan curtailment losses in connection with above mentioned plan changes per share favorable mark to market valuations in and negative valuations in per share contract termination charge in per share the favorable comparisons listed above were partially offset by the following factors increase in depreciation and amortization per share decreased margin from electric generation customers per share decreased margin from gas management services per share operating margin operating margins revenue minus gas cost and revenue taxes by customer category for the fiscal years ended september   and are set forth in the tables below residential and commercial operating margin dollars in thousands degree days average number of customers billed residential commercial average therm usage per customer residential commercial operating margin residential commercial industrial and other operating margin dollars and therms in thousands average number of customers billed electric generation industrial therms delivered electric generation industrial operating margin electric generation industrial gas management services mark to market valuations other service revenue oregon earnings sharing estimates versus residential and commercial operating margin revenue minus gas costs and revenue taxes is primarily a function of customer growth and gas usage per customer 
the net addition of approximately  billed residential and commercial customers in contributed approximately  of additional margin compared to fiscal this was mostly offset by reductions in gas usage per residential and commercial customer of and  respectively  which reduced margins by  the addition of more efficient homes and businesses  reduced consumption per consumer  and slightly warmer weather compared to last year drove the lower consumption rates 
weather statistics indicate that fiscal was warmer than fiscal and warmer than the average of the past five years 
industrial margin from natural gas deliveries to industrial customers decreased by  year to year 
this reduction is due to a variety of reasons including contract changes reducing minimum requirements  a decline in the number of customers and reduced usage by several sectors including chemical and paper manufacturing 
electric generation margin from natural gas deliveries to electric generation customers decreased  for the year with the decline attributable to lower cost hydroelectric supplies and the increased wholesale price of natural gas 
looking ahead  gas usage by generation customers will continue to depend on the variables of regional demand for power  availability of hydro resources  and the relationship between the market price of electricity and the cost of gas 
gas management gas management services margin was down  from last year 
the company has lost sales and margin as a result of increased competition for the sale of gas supplies to large volume customers 
oregon earnings sharing the change in oregon earnings sharing amounts are the result of revised estimates of liability for refunds to oregon customers related to opuc requirements 
as of the end of  the company estimated its liability to be  based on a final analysis approved by the opuc  earnings were not sufficient to trigger a sharing with customers  and in this  was reversed 
management also estimates that there will be no liability for versus residential and commercial margins from residential and commercial customers increased  of this increase  approximately  resulted from the increase of  in the average number of customers billed 
the remaining increase stemmed primarily from increased gas usage per customer  related to somewhat cooler weather 
industrial for the year  gas distribution margins from industrial customers were essentially the same as in the first half of the year  industrial distribution margin showed signs of recovery from the stagnation that followed the energy crisis and a prolonged recession 
however  the upward trend stalled in the third quarter  and in the fourth quarter  margins declined compared to the primary reason for the reversal of the positive trend is believed to be the higher wholesale prices of natural gas 
electric generation margins from electric generation customers were down  in compared to much of the decline was due to an abundance of cheap hydroelectricity and moderate regional demands for power during the first part of the year 
gas management margins from providing gas management services decreased  in from margins in were negatively impacted by an  contract termination charge 
absent this factor  gas management margin would have decreased by  in the re emergence of energy marketers  an industry segment that all but disappeared in the wake of the enron failure  resulted in stiff competition for gas supply sales to larger gas customers 
cascade has lost customers to such marketers  and margins that are available for any sales are smaller than in the past 
cost of operations versus the primary drivers of the  increase in operating expenses are organizational changes in costs of  were recognized related to the replacements of the company s chief executive and chief financial officers 
the expenses were primarily made up of severance compensation for the retiring executives  hiring expenses  and signing bonuses for the new executives 
in the fourth quarter of  the company eliminated employee positions resulting in  in severance expenses 
operating expenses in included the write off of  in capital projects determined to no longer be viable 
the projects were primarily related to development of computer software applications 
purchased services expenses in were higher by  compared to the primary driver of this increase is the costs related to the company s sarbanes oxley compliance work  with increased costs of  over bad debts expense increased  over driving this increase are higher gas costs resulting in higher customer bills 
management believes the increase also stems in part from the transition of customer service and collections activities from offices to a single consolidated customer service call center 
employee benefits expense decreased  the primary drivers of the decrease were reductions in medical and dental expenses  for active employees  and in retiree medical expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  reflecting higher depreciable assets resulting from capital spending 
versus compared to  overall cost of operations was  lower for the year 
within cost of operations  notable changes in operating expenses included the reduction in employee benefits expenses of  the comparison is affected by retirement plan curtailment charges of  in the remaining decrease is primarily attributed to changes in benefit plans initiated in  designed to reduce costs 
benefits expense in was also favorably impacted by recognition of  for the medicare prescription drug subsidy  reflected as a reduction in retiree medical expense 
in addition  expenses included a  severance cost 
the  increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily related to increases in depreciable gas distribution system assets 
income taxes the changes in the provision for income taxes from to  and from to are primarily attributable to the changes in pre tax earnings 
other comprehensive income loss the comparisons of other comprehensive income loss from to  and from to are related to minimum pension liability adjustments 
in and  the value of pension plan assets continued a modest recovery from the declines experienced in and as a result of this recovery  the company has reduced its accrual related to its unfunded accumulated benefit obligation by  and  for and liquidity and capital resources the seasonal nature of the company s business creates short term cash requirements to finance customer accounts receivable and construction expenditures 
to provide working capital for these requirements  the company has a  bank revolving credit commitment 
this agreement has a variable commitment fee and a term that expires in october the company also has a  uncommitted line of credit 
as of september   there was  outstanding under these credit lines 
due to the nature of cascade s business  which is characterized by reliable payments from a stable customer base and our expectations that capital spending will be reduced from the last few years  we expect to have limited need to source additional capital during fiscal year for this reason  combined with the availability of short term credit and the ability to issue long term debt and additional equity  management believes it has adequate financial flexibility to meet its anticipated cash needs 
the table below shows the company s future commitments under contractual obligations as of september  amounts due by fiscal year contract category beyond total dollars in thousands short term debt long term debt interest on debt operating leases gas supply interstate pipeline transportation gas storage and peaking services other total operating activities the decline in net income contributed to lower net cash provided by operating activities 
a significant factor is reflected in deferrals of gas cost changes  resulting from higher wholesale gas costs paid this year relative to the amount built in to customer rates 
this outpaced the amount of  from amortization of gas cost changes 
in october and november  the company implemented new rates designed to collect from customers the amount of fiscal gas costs  plus a temporary component designed to recover approximately million of previously deferred gas costs 
significant factors affecting non cash components of net income are prepaid income taxes and deferred income taxes 
in the fourth quarter of  the company received internal revenue service approval of an application to change the method of accounting for deferred gas costs for purposes of calculating current federal income taxes 
as a result  the company is able to deduct on its federal tax returns amounts included in deferred gas cost charges 
this change is effective retroactive to the tax return for fiscal year  and in  the company filed amended tax returns for its fiscal years and accordingly  the company has accrued an estimated refund of federal and state income taxes for those years of million 
these refunds represent temporary differences between book and taxable income  and deferred income taxes have been accrued so that there is no impact on net income resulting from this change 
as deferred gas cost charges are amortized in future years  the company s income tax liability and cash payments for income taxes will increase accordingly 
investing activities net capital expenditures for were approximately lower than last year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to  expended in on a project to install electronic devices on all the company s customer meters to allow for automated meter reading amr the amr project was begun in and completed in with total expenditures on the project of approximately  financing activities the company retired million in current maturities of long term debt during and million during these retirements were funded with two debt issues totaling million during none of the outstanding long term debt matures during fiscal additionally  during  the company reduced its short term debt by million 
proceeds from issuance of common stock are primarily issuance of new stock through the dividend reinvestment plan  k plan  and on exercise of stock options 
environmental matters there are two claims against the company for cleanup of alleged environmental contamination related to manufactured gas plant sites previously operated by companies that were subsequently merged into the company 
the first claim was received in and relates to a site in oregon 
an investigation has shown that soil and groundwater contamination exists at the site 
there are parties in addition to the company that are potentially liable for cleanup of the contamination 
some of these other parties have shared in the costs expended to date to investigate the site  and it is expected that these and other parties will share in the cleanup costs 
several alternatives for remediation of the site have been identified with preliminary estimates for cleanup ranging from approximately  to  it is not known at this time what share of the cleanup costs will actually be borne by the company 
the second claim was received in and relates to a site in washington 
an investigation has determined that there is evidence of contamination at the site  but there is also evidence that other property owners may have contributed to the contamination 
there is currently not enough information available to estimate the potential liability associated with this claim  but the company and other parties may become more involved in investigations of the nature and extent of contamination  and possible remediation of the site  as increased interest has been expressed concerning its potential for redevelopment 
management first intends to pursue reimbursement from its insurance carriers 
in the event the insurance proceeds do not completely cover the costs  management intends to seek recovery from its customers through increased rates 
there is precedent for such recovery through increased rates  as both the wutc and the opuc have previously allowed regulated utilities to increase customer rates to cover similar costs 
efficiency initiative customer service call center in january  the company began operation of a customer service call center at its existing district office in bellingham  washington 
activation of the call center was phased in  and it became fully operational in march this call center consolidated  in one location  the company s customer service function  which had been spread through offices 
to implement the call center  the company incurred  capital expenditures and  transitional expenses 
after factoring in the transitional expense  there was a small net decrease in expense compared to management expects fiscal to benefit from a full year of approximately  in reduced costs  in addition to improved customer service 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in following gaap  management exercises judgment in selection and application of accounting principles 
management considers critical accounting policies to be those where different assumptions regarding application could result in material differences in financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company has used estimates in measuring certain deferred charges and deferred credits related to items subject to approval of the wutc and the opuc 
estimates are also used in the development of discount rates and trend rates related to the measurement of retirement benefit obligations and accrual amounts  allowances for doubtful accounts  unbilled revenue  valuation of derivative instruments  and in the determination of depreciable lives of utility plant 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates used based on historical experience  current conditions  and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition the company recognizes operating revenues based on deliveries of gas and other services to customers 
this includes estimated revenues for gas delivered but not billed to residential and commercial customers from the latest meter reading date to the end of the accounting period 
regulatory accounting the company s accounting policies and practices are generally the same as used by unregulated companies for financial reporting under gaap 
however  statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  requires regulated companies to apply accounting treatment intended to reflect the financial impact of regulation 
for example  in establishing the rates to be charged to the company s retail customers  the wutc and the opuc may not allow the company to charge its customers for recovery of certain expenses in the same period they are incurred 
instead  rates are expected to be established to recover costs that were incurred in a prior period 
in this situation  following fas no 
requires the company to defer these costs and include them as regulatory assets on the balance sheet 
in the subsequent period when these costs are recovered from customers  the company then amortizes these costs as expense in the income statement in an amount equivalent to the amounts recovered 
similarly  certain revenue items  or cost reductions  may be deferred as regulatory liabilities  which are later amortized to the income statement as customer rates are reduced 
in order to apply the provisions of fas no 
 the following conditions must apply an independent regulator approves the company s customer rates 
the rates are designed to recover the company s costs of providing the regulated services or products 
there is sufficient demand for the regulated service to reasonably assure that rates can be set at a level to recover the costs 
the company periodically assesses whether conditions merit the continued applicability of fas no 
in the event the company should determine in the future that all or a portion of its regulatory assets and liabilities no longer meet the above criteria  it would be required to write off the related balances of its regulatory assets and liabilities and reflect the write off in its income statement 
pension plans the company has a defined benefit pension plan substantially covering all union employees and salaried employees hired before september  the company also provides executive officers with supplemental retirement  death and disability benefits 
these plans were amended in fiscal so that  subsequent to september   benefits under these plans no longer accrue to non bargaining unit employees and officers 
the pension plan remains substantially unchanged for bargaining unit employees at this time 
the company s pension costs for these plans are affected by the amount of cash contributions to the plans  the return on plan assets  and by employee demographics including age  compensation  and length of service 
actuarial formulas are used in the determination of pension costs and are affected by actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
key actuarial assumptions include the expected return on plan assets  the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs  and the assumed rate of increase in employee compensation 
changes in these assumptions may significantly affect pension costs 
changes to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs 
changes in pension plan obligations resulting from these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of pension plan participants 
the company s funding policy is to contribute amounts equal to or greater than the minimum amounts required to be funded under the employee retirement income security act  and not more than the maximum amounts currently deductible for income tax purposes 
the company contributed  in and  in to the pension and supplemental executive retirement plans  and expects to contribute approximately  in the discount rate the company selects is based on the average of the year and above aa debt yields published by moody s 
these are yields considered to be consistent with the expected term of pension benefits 
at september   the company used a discount rate of  down from the rate used at september  a reduction in the discount rate results in increases in projected benefit obligation  pension liability  and pension costs 
in selecting an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets  the company considers past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan 
in and  the company s assumed rate of return on plan assets was 
a reduction in the assumed rate of return would result in increases in pension liability and pension costs 
derivatives the company accounts for derivative transactions according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
these standards require that the fair value of all derivative financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the company s balance sheet and the recognition of unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income or in the calculation of net income  depending on the nature of the hedge 
most of the company s contracts for purchase and sale of natural gas qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales exception under fas no 
 and are not required to be recorded as derivative assets and liabilities 
accordingly  the company recognizes revenues and expenses on an accrual basis  based on physical delivery of natural gas 
the company applies mark to market accounting to financial derivative contracts 
periodic changes in fair market value of derivatives associated with supplies for non core customers are recognized in earnings or  if hedge accounting is applied  in other comprehensive income 
the company applies fas no 
to periodic changes in fair market value of derivatives associated with supplies for core customers and records an offset in regulatory asset and regulatory liability accounts 
new accounting standards information on new accounting standards is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item  of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has evaluated its risk related to financial instruments whose values are subject to market sensitivity 
the company has fixed rate debt obligations but does not currently have derivative financial instruments subject to interest rate risk 
cascade makes interest and principal payments on these obligations in the normal course of its business and may redeem these obligations prior to normal maturities if warranted by market conditions 
the company s natural gas purchase commodity prices are subject to fluctuations resulting from weather  congestion on interstate pipelines  and other unpredictable factors 
the company s purchased gas cost adjustment pga mechanisms assure the recovery in customer rates of prudently incurred wholesale cost of natural gas purchased for the core market 
the company primarily utilizes financial derivatives  and to a lesser extent  fixed price physical supply contracts to manage risk associated with wholesale costs of natural gas purchased for customers 
with respect to derivative arrangements covering natural gas supplies for core customers  periodic changes in fair market value are recorded in regulatory asset or regulatory liability accounts  pursuant to authority granted by the wutc and opuc  recognizing that settlements of these arrangements will be recovered through the pga mechanism 
for derivative arrangements related to supplies for non core customers  which are not covered by a pga mechanism  periodic changes in fair market value are recognized in earnings or in other comprehensive income
