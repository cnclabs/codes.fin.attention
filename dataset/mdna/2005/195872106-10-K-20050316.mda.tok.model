item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto contained in this form k 
general we are a self administered equity reit that owns  develops and operates multifamily  office and retail properties in the sunbelt region of the united states 
we are a fully integrated real estate company  which means that we are engaged in the acquisition  development  ownership  management and leasing of commercial real estate property 
our activities include full or partial ownership of a diversified portfolio of properties as of december   located in alabama  arizona  florida  georgia  mississippi  nevada  new mexico  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  texas  and virginia  development of new properties  acquisition of existing properties  build to suit development  and the provision of management  leasing  and brokerage services for commercial real estate 
as a lessor  the majority of our revenue is derived from tenants under existing leases at our properties 
therefore  our operating cash flow is dependent upon the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants  and the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments 
we believe that the diversified nature of the properties in which we typically invest multifamily  office and retail provides a more stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  in that our diversified property types generally do not have the same economic cycles and while one property type may be experiencing difficulty  the other property types may be maintaining their strength 
the following table summarizes certain key operating performance measures for our properties as of and for the years ended december  and consolidated properties unconsolidated properties total properties as of and for the year as of and for the year as of and for the year ended december  ended december  ended december  multifamily properties physical occupancy same property economic occupancy n a n a same property noi growth n a n a end of month scheduled base rent per unit per month capital expenditures per unit office properties physical occupancy same property noi growth n a n a base rent per square foot capital expenditures per square foot retail properties same property noi growth regional malls physical occupancy base rent per square foot tenant gross sales per square foot shopping centers physical occupancy base rent per square foot tenant gross sales per square foot economic occupancy represents scheduled base rents  less vacancy loss  all concessions adjusted for straightline including but not limited to renewals  move ins  models  employee units  and bad debts divided by scheduled base rents 
noi amounts are based on our segment data 
see note segment information in our notes to consolidated condensed financial statements 
as shown in the table above  multifamily occupancy and base rents continued to trend upward in improvements in were due primarily to the strengthening of the overall economy and acquisitions during of 
table of contents multifamily properties in cities such as atlanta  ga  austin  tx  charlotte  nc  raleigh durham  nc  and tampa  fl 
we expect to continue to make acquisitions of attractive multifamily properties in existing markets as well as in new markets as a result of our exposure to those new markets through joint ventures in multifamily properties 
as previously disclosed  our pending merger with cornerstone is expected to close in april in the event we complete the merger  we will be more subject to the economic trends specific to the multifamily sector  such as changes in job growth  household formation and population growth in our markets  changes in interest rates  supply and demand for apartment properties in our current markets  and competition  which could limit our ability to secure attractive investment opportunities  lease apartment properties  or increase or maintain rents 
as shown in the above table  physical occupancy of our office properties increased from in to in this increase was due primarily to improved leasing activity throughout the year 
our office properties continued to be negatively impacted by the absence of corporate hiring and a buyers market for office space in which increased tenant leverage put pressure on current rental rates 
as a result  our office division s base rent per square foot decreased from in to in  or a change 
additionally  for the year ended december   we had approximately  square feet of early lease terminations and received lease termination fees on a portion of the terminations of approximately million from our office properties 
future rental income from our office properties may be affected by future lease terminations because we may be unable to collect the full amount that was due under the lease and may incur additional cost in re leasing the space 
although there is no way of predicting future lease terminations  we currently anticipate they continue to decrease in we also presently believe the challenges that have faced the office division will continue to decrease throughout and that improved operating performance will be achieved throughout the year 
during  our retail property performance indicators all signaled continued improvement 
our average rents for malls and shopping centers showed continued growth 
tenant sales in our same properties continued to mirror the increase in rents even though the tenant sales for all properties declined slightly due to trade offs resulting from property acquisitions and dispositions 
we had  square feet more leasing activity in than the previous year at higher average rental rates and lower average tenant improvement and leasing costs per square foot 
our occupancy for all retail properties rose from in to in a basis point increase also reflected in our same properties with increases in occupancies in the anchor and big box spaces as well as in our specialty retail spaces 
we acquired six new properties all shopping centers and sold four one mall and three shopping centers 
we completed one new development and one re development in and have four new developments and three re developments in progress 
our total retail assets have grown with a shift from traditional malls to lifestyle and power centers 
we currently expect these retail occupancy and rental rate trends to continue in with our diversified strategy of investing in multifamily  office and retail property types  we are able to alter our asset mix to leverage market timing and maximize our investment returns 
currently  we are encouraged to see the multifamily market beginning to stabilize  and we are positioning our portfolio to benefit from that stabilization 
our diversified strategy allows us to balance risk and reward  and to leverage changing market conditions in three distinct sectors  which we believe lowers our risk profile  adds stability and sets us apart from our industry peers that are invested in a single property type 
cornerstone merger during october  we entered into a definitive merger agreement with cornerstone realty income trust  inc cornerstone  a richmond  virginia based reit focused on multifamily communities 
the transaction  which is expected to close during april of  is valued at approximately billion  including the assumption or repayment of cornerstone debt

more specifically  in the merger  cornerstone shareholders will have the right to elect to receive either a number of colonial common shares equal to the common share conversion rate  which we currently expect to be  or a number of colonial series e preferred depositary shares  liquidation preference per depositary share  equal to the preferred depositary share conversion rate  which we currently expect to be  for each outstanding common share of cornerstone  subject to the restriction that the colonial series e preferred 
table of contents depositary shares issued will not exceed approximately of the total merger consideration 
if the number of colonial series e preferred depositary shares to be issued in the merger or the number of holders of colonial series e preferred depositary shares does not satisfy new york stock exchange listing conditions specified in the merger agreement  then each cornerstone common share will be converted into a number of colonial common shares equal to the common share conversion rate 
in addition  the conversion rates are subject to various adjustments provided for in the merger agreement  although colonial and cornerstone do not currently expect any further material adjustments to the conversion rates 
depending upon the shareholder elections  we expect to issue approximately to million new common shares and up to approximately million of new preferred securities and refinance or assume approximately million of cornerstone s existing secured debt 
the transaction  which remains subject to approval by the common shareholders of colonial and cornerstone  has been unanimously approved by both boards 
cornerstone will have the right to terminate the transaction if our average share price for the trading days preceding trading days prior to the close of the transaction is below 
however  in the event our share price is below such level  we have the right to continue the transaction through the payment  at our sole option  of additional colonial properties common shares or cash to provide cornerstone shareholders value equivalent to that which they would have received had our share price been for such measurement period 
we have the right to terminate if our average share price exceeds for consecutive trading days preceding trading days prior to the close of the transaction

summary of critical accounting policies we believe our accounting policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to our reported operating results land  buildings  and equipment land  buildings  and equipment is stated at the lower of cost  less accumulated depreciation  or fair value 
we review long lived assets and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the asset s fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  as follows useful lives buildings years furniture and fixtures or years equipment or years land improvements or years tenant improvements life of lease repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets 
when items of land  buildings  or equipment are sold or retired  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recorded 
the company recognizes sales of real estate properties only upon the closing of a transaction 
payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits 
profit on real estate sold is recognized using the full accrual method upon closing 
table of contents when the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured and the company is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale 
profit may be deferred in whole or part until the sale meets the requirements of profit recognition on sales of real estate under gaap 
for properties sold to a joint venture in which the company retains an ownership percentage  the company limits the profit recognized from the sale to the portion sold to the outside party 
further  the profit is limited by the amount of cash received for which the company has no commitment to reinvest 
acquisition of real estate assets we account for acquisitions of investments in real estate by allocating the purchase price to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and tenant improvements  and to identifiable intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of other tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
we consider acquisitions of operating real estate assets to be businesses as that term is contemplated in emerging issues task force issue no 
 determining whether a non monetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business 
we allocate purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes the land and building determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant 
the as if vacant value is allocated to land and buildings based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets 
we also allocate value to tenant improvements based on the estimated costs of similar tenants with similar terms 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
the aggregate value of other intangible assets acquired are measured based on the difference between i the property valued with existing in place leases adjusted to market rental rates and ii the property valued as if vacant 
we may engage independent third party appraisers to perform these valuations and those appraisals use commonly employed valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flow analyses 
factors considered in these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  management also includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods depending on specific local market conditions and depending on the type of property acquired 
we also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction 
the total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in place leases  which includes other tenant relationship intangible values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the company s overall relationship with that respective tenant 
characteristics considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of the company s existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement or management s expectation for renewal  among other factors 
the value of in place leases and tenant relationships are amortized as a leasing cost expense over the initial term of the respective leases and any renewal periods  which are primarily expected to range from to years and which have a current weighted average composite life of years 
in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building 
should a tenant terminate its lease  the unamortized portion of the in place lease value and customer relationship intangibles would be charged to expense 
we are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities and will not be successful in all cases 
costs incurred related to these acquisition opportunities are expensed when it becomes probable that we will not be successful in the acquisition 

table of contents real estate development we capitalize all costs  including interest and real estate taxes that are associated with a development  construction  expansion  or leasing of real estate investments as a cost of the property 
all other expenditures necessary to maintain a property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred during predevelopment are capitalized after we have identified a development site  determined that a project is feasible  and concluded that it is probable that the project will proceed 
while we believe we will recover this capital through the successful development of such projects  it is possible that a write off of unrecoverable amounts could occur 
once it becomes probable that a development will not be successful  the predevelopment costs that have been previously capitalized are expensed 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  crlp  cpsi and cpslp 
the minority limited partnership interests in crlp are reflected as minority interest in our consolidated financial statements 
all significant inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
entities in which the company owns  directly or indirectly  a or less interest and does not control are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as investments accounted for under the equity method 
under this method the investment is carried at cost plus or minus equity in undistributed earnings or losses since the date of acquisition 
for those entities in which we own less than of the equity interest  we consolidate the property if we have the direct or indirect ability to make major decisions about the entities activities based on the terms of the respective joint venture agreements which specify the sharing of participating and protective rights such as decisions regarding major leases  encumbering the entities with debt and whether to dispose of entities 
we would also consolidate certain partially owned entities and other subsidiaries if we own less than equity interest and are deemed to be the primary beneficiary as defined by fasb interpretation consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 as revised fin r 
revenue recognition we  as a lessor  have retained substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of our properties and account for our leases as operating leases 
rental income attributable to leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related lease 
certain leases contain provisions for additional rent based on a percentage of tenant sales 
percentage rents are recognized in the period in which sales thresholds are met 
recoveries from tenants for taxes  insurance  and other property operating expenses are recognized in the period the applicable costs are incurred in accordance with the terms of the respective leases 
other income received from long term contracts signed in the normal course of business is recognized in accordance with the terms of the specific contract 
property management and development fee income is recognized when earned for services provided to third parties 
valuation of receivables we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies at our office and retail properties that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  we perform credit review and analysis on all commercial tenants and significant leases before they are executed 
we evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables and record allowances as appropriate 
our policy is to record allowances for all outstanding receivables greater than days past due for our office and retail properties 
due to the short term nature of the leases at our multifamily properties  generally six months to one year  our exposure to tenant defaults and bankruptcies is minimized 
our policy is to record allowances for all outstanding receivables greater than days past due at our multifamily properties 
derivative instruments we enter into derivative financial instruments from time to time  but do not use them for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements are used to reduce the potential impact of increases in interest rates on variable rate debt 
we adjust our balance sheets on an ongoing quarterly basis to reflect current fair market value of our derivatives 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive 
table of contents income  as appropriate 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized into earnings to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged 
the unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income loss will be reclassified to earnings over time and occur when the hedged items are also recognized in earnings 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
this process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedge transaction  the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument s effectiveness in hedging the exposure to the hedged transaction s variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk will be assessed 
both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  we assess whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items 
we discontinue hedge accounting if a derivative is not determined to be highly effective as a hedge or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge 
liquidity and capital resources short term liquidity needs our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses directly associated with our portfolio of properties including regular maintenance items  capital expenditures incurred to lease our space eg  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding debt  and quarterly dividends and distributions that we pay to our common and preferred shareholders and holders of partnership units in our operating partnership 
in the past  we have primarily satisfied these requirements through cash generated from operations 
we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under our unsecured line of credit will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
however  factors described below and elsewhere herein may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow 
the majority of our revenue is derived from tenants under existing leases at our properties 
therefore  our operating cash flow is dependent upon the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants  and the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments 
we believe that the diversified nature of the properties in which we typically invest multifamily  office and retail provides a more stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  in that our diversified property types generally do not have the same economic cycles and while one property type may be experiencing difficulty  the other property types may be maintaining their strength 
we have made an election to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  commencing with its taxable year ending december  if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our shareholders 
even if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the principal amount of our long term debt as it matures  significant non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically at our properties  development projects that we undertake and costs associated with acquisitions of properties that we pursue 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through the most advantageous source of capital at that time  which has included the incurrence of new debt through borrowings through public offerings of unsecured debt and private incurrence of secured and unsecured debt  sales of common and preferred stock  capital raised through the disposition of assets  and joint venture capital transactions 
we believe these sources of capital will continue to be available in the future to fund our long term capital needs 
however  factors described below and elsewhere herein may have a material adverse effect on our access to these capital sources 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our credit ratings  the value of our unencumbered assets  our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our current lenders 
we currently have investment grade ratings for prospective unsecured debt offerings from three major rating agencies 
if we experienced a credit downgrade  we may be limited in our access to capital in the unsecured debt market  which we have historically utilized to fund investment activities  and the interest rate we are paying under our existing credit facility would increase 
our ability to raise funds through sales of common stock and preferred stock is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about our company and the current trading price of our stock 
we 
table of contents will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but the equity markets may not be consistently available on terms that are attractive 
over the last few years  we have maintained our asset recycling program  which allows us to maximize our investment returns through the sale of assets that have reached their maximum investment potential and reinvest the proceeds into opportunities with more growth potential 
during  we disposed of two multifamily properties including one property representing units and our interest in a second property representing units  one office property representing  square feet  and four retail properties including three wholly owned properties representing  square feet and our interest in a fourth property representing million square feet 
the multifamily  office and retail properties were sold for a total sales price of million  which was used to repay a portion of the borrowings under our unsecured line of credit 
our ability to generate cash from asset sales is limited by market conditions and certain rules applicable to reits 
our ability to sell properties in the future to raise cash will be limited if market conditions make such sales unattractive 
as of december   we have an unsecured bank line of credit providing for total borrowings of up to million 
this line of credit agreement bears interest at libor plus a spread calculated based on our unsecured debt ratings from time to time 
based on our current debt ratings  the spread is basis points 
the line of credit is renewable in november and provides for a one year extension 
the line of credit agreement includes a competitive bid feature that will allow us to convert up to million under the line of credit to a fixed rate  for a fixed term not to exceed days 
the credit facility had an outstanding balance of million at december  the floating weighted average interest rate of this short term borrowing facility  including the competitive bid balance  was at december  as of december   we have a million bridge facility with certain participants of our current million unsecured bank line of credit 
base rate loans and euro dollar loans are available under the bridge facility 
generally  base rate loans bear interest at wachovia s designated base rate  plus a base rate margin ranging from to based on our unsecured debt ratings from time to time 
euro dollar loans bear interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to based on our unsecured debt ratings from time to time 
the bridge facility had an outstanding balance of million at december   with an average interest rate of 
this facility matures in november of we are currently in the process of negotiating a new unsecured credit facility that will replace the existing unsecured bank line of credit and bridge facility 
we expect to complete this transaction in the first quarter of however  we are not able to predict the terms of this new unsecured credit facility or whether we will be successful in completing this transaction 
at december   our total outstanding debt balance was billion 
the outstanding balance includes fixed rate debt of billion  or of the total debt balance  and floating rate debt of million  or of the total debt balance 
our total market capitalization as of december  was billion and our ratio of debt to market capitalization was 
we have certain loan agreements that contain restrictive covenants  which among other things require maintenance of various financial ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
effect of cornerstone merger on liquidity and capital resources in the event we complete our merger with cornerstone  we will assume the debt of cornerstone  which was million as of december  we currently expect to repay a portion of cornerstone s outstanding debt with proceeds from previously issued unsecured debt financing and additional unsecured debt financings which we are currently negotiating with prospective lenders 
we currently expect to obtain the additional unsecured debt financings on favorable terms 
however we cannot give assurance that the debt financings will be obtained 
as a result of the increased debt levels associated with the cornerstone merger  additional cash flow from operations will be used to make interest and principal payments on debt rather than for other purposes such as working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate purposes 
however  we currently expect that additional cash flows from operations as a result of the merger will fund such activities 
investing activities during  we acquired multifamily properties containing  units  two office properties containing  square feet and six retail properties  including one retail property that is owned  containing  square feet for an aggregate cost of million

during  we invested an aggregate of million in the development of these aforementioned development projects and certain parcels of land that were acquired for future development 
we regularly incur significant expenditures in connection with the re leasing of our office and retail space  principally in the form of tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly  depending on negotiations with tenants and the willingness of tenants 
we also incur expenditures for certain recurring capital expenses 
during  we incurred approximately million related to tenant improvements and leasing commissions  and approximately million of recurring capital expenditures 
we expect to pay for future re leasing and recurring capital expenditures out of cash from operations 
dividend the dividend on our common stock was per share per quarter or per share annually in we also pay regular quarterly dividends on our preferred stock and units 
the maintenance of these dividends is subject to various factors  including the discretion of our board of trustees  our ability to pay dividends under alabama law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements  which require at least of our taxable income to be distributed to shareholders 
we also make regular quarterly distributions on units in our operating partnership 
financing transactions on february   crlp modified the terms of the million series b preferred units the preferred units  which were originally issued in a private placement 
under the modified terms  the preferred units bear a distribution rate of and are redeemable at the option of crlp  in whole or in part  after february   at the cost of the original capital contribution plus the cumulative priority return  whether or not declared

on april   we completed a million public debt offering of unsecured senior notes by crlp 
the notes  which mature in april bear a coupon rate of  and were priced to yield an effective rate of over the seven year term 
we used the net proceeds of the offering to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on its unsecured line of credit

in anticipation of closing the above mentioned public debt offering  we entered into a million treasury lock on june  with a fixed year treasury rate of 
on june   we settled the treasury lock agreement with a payment of approximately million  which will be amortized over the life of the associated debt 
on october   we entered into an additional million bridge facility with certain participants of its current million unsecured bank line of credit

credit ratings our current credit ratings are as follows rating agency rating last update standard poor s bbb december  moody s baa january  fitch bbb october  ratings outlook is stable

if we experience a credit downgrade  we may be limited in our access to capital in the unsecured debt market  which we have historically utilized to fund its investment activities 
in addition  our spread on our million unsecured line of credit would increase as previously discussed 
market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes that could affect our results of operations and financial condition or cash flow 
we limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures  including the use of derivative instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risk 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes at december  estimated amounts in thousands fair thereafter total value fixed rate debt average interest rate at december  variable debt average interest rate at december  the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  it does not consider those exposures or positions  which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates 
our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we primarily use interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks as part of our cash flow hedging strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
during  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable rate debt  existing lines of credit  and forecasted issuances of debt 
two of our outstanding interest rate swaps at december   hedge the interest rate risk associated with forecasted debt issuances that are expected to occur in accordingly  the maximum period of time over which we are hedging our exposure to variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions other than those related to the payment of variable interest on existing debt is approximately eight months 
we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our fair value hedging strategy 
these swaps involve the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for variable rate amounts over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
during  such swaps were used to hedge the change in fair value of fixed rate debt 

table of contents we have entered into several different hedging transactions in an effort to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
the following table summarizes the notional values  fair values and other characteristics of our derivative financial instruments at december  the notional value at december  provides an indication of the extent of our involvement in these instruments at that time  but does not represent exposure to credit  interest rate  or market risk

further  we have a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  we have not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor do we anticipate any material adverse effect on our net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives 
at december  and  derivatives with a fair value of million and  respectively  were included in other assets and derivatives with a fair value of million and million  respectively  were included in other liabilities 
the change in net unrealized gains losses of million in  million in and million in for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is separately disclosed in the statement of changes in shareholders equity and comprehensive income 
the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges of million is included in other losses in there were not any derivatives not designated as hedges in and no hedge ineffectiveness on fair value hedges was recognized during  and hedge ineffectiveness of  million and  on cash flow hedges due to index mismatches was recognized in other income during  and  respectively

table of contents other commercial commitments total amounts in thousands committed thereafter standby letters of credit guarantees total commercial commitments guarantees and other arrangements during january  we initiated and completed an executive unit purchase program unit purchase program  in which the board of trustees and certain members of our management were able to purchase  units of crlp 
the value of the units purchased under the unit purchase program was approximately million 
under the unit purchase program  the board of trustees and the members of management obtained full recourse personal loans from an unrelated financial institution  in order to purchase the units 
as of december   the outstanding balance on these loans was million as some participants had exited the program and repaid their principal balance 
the units  which have a market value of approximately million at december   are pledged as collateral against the loans 
we have provided a guarantee to the unrelated financial institution for the personal loans  which matured in january at december   no liability was recorded on our books for the guarantee 
in connection with the maturity of the remaining outstanding loans in january  our guarantees for such loans were terminated 
during august  in connection with the purchase of heathrow international business center  we entered into an agreement to acquire one new office building that contains  square feet 
the closing for this acquisition is anticipated to occur upon the earlier of august or at such time that the seller achieves certain leasing targets for the property 
the purchase price will be determined based upon the percentage of gross leasable area actually leased and the net operating income generated by the leases at the time of acquisition 
during december  we sold of our interest in colonial promenade hoover for a total sales price of million  and formed highway llc  in which we maintain ownership and manage the property 
in connection with the formation of highway llc  we executed a guaranty  pursuant to which we would serve as a guarantor of million of the debt related to the joint venture  which is collateralized by the colonial promenade hoover retail property 
our maximum guarantee of million may be requested by the lender  only after all of the rights and remedies available under the associated note and security agreements have been exercised and exhausted 
at december   the total amount of debt of the joint venture was approximately million and matures in december at december   no liability was recorded on our books for the guarantee 
in connection with the contribution of certain assets to crlp  certain partners of crlp have guaranteed indebtedness of the company totaling million at december  the guarantees are held in order for the contributing partners to maintain their tax deferred status on the contributed assets 
these individuals have not been indemnified by the company 
additionally  certain unitholders of crlp and trustees of the company have guaranteed indebtedness of the company totaling million at december  the company has indemnified these individuals from their guarantees of this indebtedness 
outlook management intends to maintain our strength through continued diversification  while pursuing acquisitions and developments that meet our criteria for property quality  market strength  and investment return 
management will continue to use our unsecured line of credit to provide short term financing for acquisition  development  and re development activities and plans to continue to replace significant borrowings under the bank line of credit with funds generated from the sale of additional debt and equity securities and permanent financing  as market conditions permit 
management believes that these potential sources of funds  along with the possibility of issuing limited partnership units of crlp in exchange for properties  will provide us with the means to finance additional acquisitions  developments  and expansions 

table of contents in addition to the issuance of equity and debt  management is investigating alternate financing methods and sources to raise future capital 
private placements  joint ventures  and non traditional equity and debt offerings are some of the alternatives we are contemplating 
management anticipates that our net cash provided by operations and our existing cash balances will provide the necessary funds on a short and long term basis to cover our operating expenses  interest expense on outstanding indebtedness  recurring capital expenditures  and dividends to shareholders in accordance with internal revenue code requirements applicable to real estate investment trusts 
as previously disclosed  our pending merger with cornerstone is expected to close in april in the event we complete the merger  we will be more subject to the economic trends specific to the multifamily sector  such as changes in job growth  household formation and population growth in our markets  changes in interest rates  supply and demand for apartment properties in our current markets  and competition  which could limit our ability to secure attractive investment opportunities  lease apartment properties  or increase or maintain rents 
inflation leases at the multifamily properties generally provide for an initial term of six months to one year and allow for rent adjustments at the time of renewal 
leases at the office properties typically provide for rent adjustments and the pass through of certain operating expenses during the term of the lease 
substantially all of the leases at the retail properties provide for the pass through to tenants of certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance expenses  and insurance 
all of these provisions permit us to increase rental rates or other charges to tenants in response to rising prices and  therefore  serve to minimize our exposure to the adverse effects of inflation 
an increase in general price levels may immediately precede  or accompany  an increase in interest rates 
at december   our exposure to rising interest rates was mitigated by the existing debt level of of our total market capitalization  the high percentage of fixed rate debt and the use of interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on approximately million through may as it relates to the short term  increases in interest expense resulting from increasing inflation is anticipated to be less than future increases in income before interest 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is useful to investors as a measure of performance for an equity reit that provides a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  means income loss before minority interest determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from debt restructuring and sales of depreciated property  plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing our performance 
prior to january   we had also included marketing fees on sales transactions within ffo  in which we used internal employees to complete the asset sales 
effective january  we conformed our ffo definition to adhere to the nareit white paper definition 
as a result  we are no longer including marketing fees on sales transactions and we are no longer excluding straight line rents to arrive at ffo 
we believe that ffo is useful to investors because it provides an additional indicator of our financial and operating performance 
this is because  by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation and gains or losses from sales of properties all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparison of operating performance among equity reits 
our method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
ffo i does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by gaap  ii is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and liquidity  including our ability to make distributions  and iii should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with gaap for purposes of evaluating our operating performance
