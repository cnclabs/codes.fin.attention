although forward looking statements help to provide complete information about us  readers should keep in mind that forward looking statements may not be reliable 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained herein and the notes thereto  along with the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates  set forth below 
overview our company operates primarily in the worldwide billion in vitro diagnostics business 
we develop  manufacture and market oral fluid specimen collection devices using proprietary oral fluid technologies  diagnostic products including immunoassays  and other in vitro diagnostic tests 
we also manufacture and sell medical devices for the removal of warts and other benign skin lesions by cryosurgery  or freezing 
our diagnostic product offerings primarily target the infectious disease and substance abuse testing segments of the larger in vitro diagnostic market  and are used in both laboratories as well as the emerging  and rapidly growing  point of care marketplace 
our orasure and intercept oral fluid collection devices  and their related assays  are processed in a laboratory  while the oraquick rapid hiv antibody tests and the uplink oral fluid rapid drug detection system are designed for use at the point of care 
our cryosurgical products  which are sold under the names histofreezer and freeze off  are also used at the point of care 
in vitro diagnostics have traditionally used blood or urine as the bodily fluids upon which tests are conducted 
however  we have targeted the use of oral fluid in our products as a differentiating factor  and believe that it provides a significant competitive advantage over blood and urine 
our oral fluid tests have sensitivity and specificity comparable to blood and or urine tests and  when combined with their ease of use  non invasive and dignified nature  and cost effectiveness  represent a very competitive alternative to the more traditional testing methods in the diagnostic space 
we have made significant progress in increasing our sales and gaining market acceptance for our products 
as a result  we reported strong financial results for our total revenues were million  or an increase of over  and our net loss for the year was million  representing an improvement of more than million over our liquidity also improved  as we reported million in cash flow from operations in and we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  sales into the infectious disease testing market segment increased significantly in due to the continued market acceptance of our oraquick device 
this increase resulted largely from sales directly to various public health organizations  sales to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc for further distribution in the public health market  and sales to abbott laboratories for distribution primarily to hospitals 
during the period march june  we received fda approval of our new oraquick advance test to detect antibodies to both hiv and hiv in oral fluid  fingerstick whole blood  venous whole blood  and plasma samples  in june  we also obtained a clia waiver for the oraquick advance hiv test for all specimen types except plasma 
this new product was officially launched commercially in october since that time  the demand for oraquick advance has grown quickly  and we are working to convert all oraquick customers to this new product and expect eventually to cease selling our original oraquick hiv test 

table of contents in june  we received a nonexclusive  worldwide sublicense to certain hiv patents held by bio rad laboratories 
we believe that the recently approved oraquick advance test  together with the sublicense from bio rad  will provide a significant competitive advantage by allowing us to sell a versatile rapid hiv test that is capable of detecting antibodies to both the hiv and hiv strains of the virus in oral fluids  finger stick whole blood  venous whole blood and plasma 
in  the cdc and samhsa placed purchase orders totaling million for oraquick devices and related testing materials 
both of these orders were for oraquick advance 
we expect that these agencies  and perhaps other federal governmental agencies  will make future bulk purchases of oraquick advance for further distribution to the public health and other markets throughout the united states 
in february  we entered into a new agreement for the distribution of oraquick advance with abbott laboratories 
under this agreement  abbott was appointed as our exclusive distributor in the us hospital market and as a non exclusive distributor in the us physicians office marketplace 
as our exclusive distributor to hospitals  abbott will sell oraquick advance to federal hospitals under the terms and conditions of our federal supply schedule that is filed with the us general services administration 
we have retained exclusive rights to all other markets  including the public health and criminal justice markets  the military  the cdc  samhsa and other government agencies 
in  we deployed a small sales force that provided direct access to and marketing support for the sales of our oraquick test into the hospital market 
this sales force will now support abbott and will work together with them to maximize the penetration of oraquick advance in the hospital market 
the markets for rapid hiv testing are very competitive and the level of competition is expected to increase  which could affect sales of our oraquick tests 
for example  the ortho diagnostics division of johnson johnson and bio rad laboratories each sell competing laboratory based hiv eias  and calypte  inc sells an hiv screening test for urine  in the united states 
in addition  medmira and trinity biotech have each received fda approval to sell competing rapid hiv blood tests and bio rad recently received fda approval for a rapid hiv blood test 
we believe these tests  under their current fda approvals  will compete with our oraquick tests in the hospital or other laboratory settings 
in addition  trinity biotech has received clia waiver for its rapid fingerstick hiv blood test  and we believe that this test will compete with our oraquick tests in the public health and other markets outside of the traditional hospital and laboratory settings 
these companies  or others  may continue to expand the bodily fluids with which a rapid hiv test may be performed or develop and commercialize new rapid tests  either of which would provide further competition for our oraquick tests 
sales to the substance abuse testing market also increased during  reflecting the growing acceptance of our intercept collection device and related oral fluid drug assays  as corporate and criminal justice customers continued to shift to oral fluid and away from traditional urine based drug testing 
this increase was partially offset by lower sales of our drug assays to the forensic toxicology market 
we expect continuing growth in the utilization of our intercept product line  primarily in the united states and united kingdom 
in march  the fda responded to our application for k clearance of the uplink rapid oral fluid drugs of abuse detection system  by indicating that additional performance data would be needed in order to obtain clearance 
we are evaluating the fda s requirements and whether any modifications to our uplink system will be required in order to provide that data 
at this time  we cannot predict if or when we will resubmit an application for k clearance of the uplink system 
however  the absence of k clearance will not affect our ability to sell the uplink system internationally 
in april  we launched our uplink system in germany and other european countries  primarily in the roadside testing market  with our partner  dr ger safety 
in april  samhsa published proposed guidelines that would  if adopted  include oral fluid testing as an accepted drug testing method for federal employees 
we have responded to samhsa s proposed guidelines with a comment letter and await the final guidelines that will apply to both our intercept and uplink drugs of abuse test 
we are unable to predict at this time whether additional modifications may be required to bring our 
table of contents uplink or intercept drug testing systems into compliance with the guidelines when finally adopted or what effect  if any  non compliance with the final guidelines will have on our product offerings 
compliance with the guidelines will be required in order for us to sell our drug testing products to federal employees and possibly other industries that are influenced by the federal guidelines in structuring their drug testing programs 
sales to the cryosurgical systems market during have grown substantially 
the cryosurgical systems market represents sales of histofreezer into both the domestic and international physicians office markets and sales of the over the counter otc formulation of this product  called freeze off  to our partner  medtech holdings  inc medtech  a wholly owned subsidiary of prestige brands holdings  inc medtech distributes freeze off to consumers under its compound w trademark in the otc market in the united states 
in july  we filed a lawsuit against schering plough healthcare products  inc schering plough for infringement of several of our patents relating to the technology for the cryosurgical removal ie  freezing of warts and other benign skin lesions 
the suit was commenced in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania  and alleges that schering plough s manufacture and sale of its dr 
scholl s freeze away cryosurgical wart removal product in the over the counter market infringes three of our patents 
we are seeking injunctive relief and the payment of damages  and schering plough has raised several defenses  including that their freeze away device does not infringe our patents and that one or more of our patents are either invalid or unenforceable 
we currently expect that a final trial on the merits in this matter will occur in the spring of sales to the insurance risk assessment market continued to decline in  primarily as a result of lower device and assay sales to our largest customer  labone  inc the assays have experienced substantial competitive pressure from home brew assays internally developed by this customer 
sales of these products are not expected to recover 
we anticipate little growth in the insurance risk assessment market until we are successful in developing new oral fluid based diagnostic tests for additional predictive health markers desired by the insurance industry 
during  we received all necessary fda approvals to transfer the manufacture of our intercept and orasure collection devices and our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory test from oregon to our facilities in bethlehem  pennsylvania 
this transfer has been completed and is expected to reduce our annual operating expenses and improve our ability to control the quality of the transferred products 
in january  the lease on our oregon facility expired and all operations at that location have now ceased 
the absence of this lease will reduce our operating expenses 
because of the regulatory approvals needed for most of our products  we often are required to rely on sole source providers for critical components and materials 
this is particularly true for our oraquick tests and oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory product 
if we are unable to obtain necessary components or materials from these sole sources  the time required to develop replacements and obtain the required fda approvals could disrupt our ability to sell the affected products 
in addition  any delay or interruption in our ability to manufacture the oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory test would adversely affect sales of our orasure oral fluid collection device  as our customers are not expected to purchase orasure devices if an oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory test is not readily available 
we generated approximately of our revenues in the us marketplace 
consequently  we are evaluating strategies to increase our sales penetration in markets outside the us as our business in foreign countries increases  we will be exposed to additional risks  including economic  political  exchange rate  regulatory and cultural risks 

table of contents results of operations twelve months ended december  compared to december  total revenues increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  primarily as a result of increased sales of our freeze off wart removal product  oraquick rapid hiv antibody test and intercept oral fluid collection device and related drug assays  partially offset by a decline in assay revenues in the insurance risk assessment market 
revenues derived from products sold in countries outside the us were approximately million and million  or and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the table below shows the amount of our total revenues in thousands  except generated in each of our principal markets and by licensing and product development activities 
years ended december  dollars change percentage of total revenues market revenues insurance risk assessment infectious disease testing substance abuse testing cryosurgical systems product revenues licensing and product development total revenues sales to the insurance risk assessment market declined by to approximately million in from approximately million in  primarily as a result of lower insurance testing assay sales 
we expect that sales of our urine assays will continue to come under competitive pressure because of sluggish sales and competitive conditions in the life insurance testing market 
as a result of these conditions  our laboratory customers have eliminated or reduced their purchases of these products and instead use lower cost  internally developed ie  home brew assays or testing products purchased from our competitors 
we currently expect that our revenues in this market segment will remain at approximately the levels attained in sales to the infectious disease testing market increased to approximately million in  primarily as a result of higher sales of our oraquick rapid hiv antibody test 
oraquick and orasure sales during totaled approximately million and million  respectively  as compared to approximately million and million  respectively  for during  we recorded approximately million in direct sales of oraquick to the us public health market and approximately million to the cdc 
we also had oraquick sales of approximately million to abbott  approximately  directly to hospital customers  and approximately million to the international marketplace 
during  we recorded approximately million in direct sales of oraquick to the us public health market and approximately million to the cdc 
we also had oraquick sales of approximately million to abbott and approximately  to the international marketplace in as previously indicated  during we received a total of million in purchase orders from the cdc and samhsa for oraquick advance rapid hiv antibody tests  of which approximately  were shipped in we expect to complete shipment of the remaining devices pursuant to these purchase orders in we believe that our oraquick advance device  which is approved for detecting antibodies to both hiv and in oral fluid  fingerstick and venous whole blood  and plasma samples  and is clia waived for use 
table of contents with all sample types except plasma  provides a significant competitive advantage and will allow us to more fully implement a strategy to sell oraquick internationally 
this new test was commercially launched in late october  and initial shipments of this product began in early november we are currently pursuing ce marking for our oraquick advance product which would allow us to sell our product in europe 
our goal is to obtain a ce mark for oraquick advance by the summer of  and obtain several country specific registrations to allow us to launch the product in europe later this year 
although sales of oraquick are expected to increase  such sales may negatively impact sales of our orasure oral fluid collection device in the infectious disease testing market 
customers who now or in the future may purchase our orasure device for hiv testing may elect instead to purchase our oraquick tests 
it is not possible at this time  however  to estimate the timing or extent of such change in purchasing patterns or the financial impact of replacing orasure sales with sales of our oraquick tests  if it occurs at all 
sales to the substance abuse testing market increased to approximately million in as a result of higher sales of our intercept oral fluid collection device and related drug assays in the workplace  criminal justice and international marketplaces 
sales of our intercept device and related drug assays in increased  or by approximately million over the comparable period in we expect continued growth in intercept sales in as customers continue to shift from urine based to oral fluid based testing methods 
in april  we launched our uplink rapid oral fluid drug detection system  including assays for the detection of drugs of abuse commonly identified by the national institute for drug abuse nida as the nida ie  cocaine  opiates  amphetamines methamphetamines  pcp and marijuana with our partner  dr ger safety 
this product is being initially sold to the roadside testing market in europe 
revenues from this product were approximately  in as part of our recently concluded strategic review of the business  we concluded that the roadside drugs of abuse market may not be as attractive as a number of other opportunities 
consequently  we are exploring our options with respect to this product including transitioning the manufacturing of the product to dr ger  which is permitted under our agreement with dr ger 
in exchange  we would expect to receive a royalty on future sales by dr ger while retaining the right to sell uplink in the workplace testing and other markets 
sales of our products in the cryosurgical systems market which includes both the physicians office and otc markets increased to approximately million in this increase was primarily the result of an increase of million in sales of our otc cryosurgical product  called freeze off  to medtech  the owner of the compound w line of wart removal products 
in  we entered into a distribution agreement with medtech following receipt of fda k clearance for the sale of our cryosurgical system in the otc market in the us medtech launched the freeze off product in the third quarter of  and there were million of sales to medtech during freeze off is being sold under medtech s compound w trademark 
our five year distribution agreement requires minimum purchases by medtech of at least million each year over the life of the contract in order for medtech to maintain its exclusive distribution rights to the otc market in the us however  based on additional purchase orders received to date  we expect sales of product to medtech to reach at least million during the first quarter of we have concluded a review of the market potential for over the counter cryosurgical product in the european union and have entered negotiations with a select number of top tier distribution partners 
we expect to announce a distributor in the near future and intend to launch an otc product in selected european countries later in sales of our histofreezer product to physicians offices in the us and international markets increased and to approximately million and million  respectively  in  when compared to  primarily as a result of higher distributor purchases 
we anticipate that us sales of histofreezer in the professional market will continue to increase in sales in the international market are expected to increase above levels as we secure additional distributors in countries where the product is currently not sold 

table of contents although not our experience to date in the us professional marketplace  it is possible that sales of the freeze off product in the us otc market may reduce the number of individuals that will seek to obtain treatment of their warts by a physician  which in turn could negatively affect sales of our histofreezer product in the professional market 
however  it is not possible at this time to estimate the timing or financial impact of such a change  if it occurs at all 
medtech  our largest customer  accounted for approximately and of total revenues for and  respectively 
labone accounted for approximately and of total revenues for and  respectively 
licensing and product development revenues decreased to approximately  in  from approximately  in the comparable period in licensing and product development revenues in were primarily related to our collaborative uplink and oral fluid research project with the university of pennsylvania  under a grant awarded by the national institutes of health 
the current annual phase of this grant expires in june and our share of funding is expected to be approximately  for that period 
further revenues beyond june will depend on progress achieved in the research and future funding awarded by the national institutes of health 
the company s gross margin was in  compared to in our gross margin was positively impacted by more efficient utilization of the company s manufacturing capacity  offset by higher production costs associated with the company s uplink rapid oral fluid drug detection system  a less favorable product sales mix  and higher scrap as a result of the transfer of production from oregon 
research and development expenses decreased to approximately million in  from approximately million for the comparable period in  primarily as a result of lower staffing costs and costs associated with transferring our manufacturing operations from oregon to bethlehem 
research and development costs are expected to increase in primarily as a result of costs associated with the development of new product offerings and product enhancements for the infectious disease and substance abuse markets 
sales and marketing expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was primarily the result of higher product advertising expenditures  costs associated with our hospital sales force and increased staffing related expenses 
included in advertising expenses was million and million for and  respectively  paid to medtech as reimbursement for marketing expenses incurred for the compound w freeze off product 
we expect that sales and marketing expense will increase in at a more moderate rate compared to as we attempt to increase our presence in the international marketplace  we will incur additional expenses related to this effort 
promotional expenses are also expected to increase as we continue in our efforts to expand market awareness and acceptance for our oraquick  intercept and histofreezer products 
pursuant to our agreement with medtech  we will also continue to co invest in medtech s marketing activities for the compound w freeze off product  and we will reimburse medtech  on a declining basis over the next two years of the agreement  for a portion of medtech s out of pocket costs of advertising and promoting this product in the otc market 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was primarily attributable to legal fees associated with the schering plough litigation  transition costs for the retirement of our former chief executive officer and the additional costs of hiring our new chief executive officer  consulting fees for strategic planning  increased staffing related expenses and increased professional fees related to compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of general and administrative expenses are expected to increase further in versus as a result of legal fees associated with the schering plough patent litigation 
interest expense decreased to approximately  in from approximately  in  as a result of lower outstanding debt balances 
interest income increased to approximately  in from approximately  in  as a result of substantially larger balances available for investment

in september  we entered into a million credit facility the credit facility with comerica bank 
the credit facility  when originally executed  was comprised of an  mortgage loan  a million term loan  a million non revolving equipment line of credit  and a million revolving working capital line of credit 
in september  we executed an amendment to the credit facility 
pursuant to this amendment  the million non revolving equipment line of credit the original non revolving line was replaced with a new million non revolving line of credit for the purchase of both capital equipment and software the new non revolving line 
as a result  the original non revolving line has expired and any new non revolving borrowings for equipment or software will be made under the new non revolving line 
borrowings outstanding under the original non revolving line at the time of the amendment will not be applied against the credit limit for the new non revolving line and will remain payable in accordance with their original terms 
the amendment also extended the maturity date of the million revolving working capital line of credit by one year  and provided for certain modifications to our financial covenants under the credit facility 
the term loan and mortgage were not affected by the amendment 
in september  the credit facility was amended further to extend the maturity date of our revolving working capital line of credit to april  the  mortgage loan matures in september  bears interest at an annual floating rate equal to comerica s prime rate at december   and is repayable in fixed monthly principal and interest installments of  through september  at which time the interest rate and fixed monthly repayment

off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue recognition  restructuring costs  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we consider the following accounting estimates  which have been discussed with our audit committee  to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
revenue recognition 
we follow us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

this bulletin draws on existing accounting rules and provides specific guidance on revenue recognition for up front non refundable licensing and development fees 
we license certain products or technology to outside third parties  in return for which we receive up front licensing fees 
some of these fees can be significant 
in accordance with sab no 
 we recognize this revenue ratably over the related license period 
we also enter into research and development contracts with corporate  government and or private entities 
these contracts generally provide for payments to us upon achievement of certain research or development milestones 
product development revenues from these contracts are recognized only if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the customer and payment from the customer is probable 
any amounts received prior to the performance of product development efforts are recorded as deferred revenues 
recognition of revenue under these contracts can be sporadic  as it is the result of achieving specific research and development milestones 
furthermore  revenue from future milestone payments will not be recognized if the underlying research and development milestone is not achieved 
we recognize product revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has passed and collection is reasonably assured 
product revenues are net of allowances for any discounts or rebates 
we do not grant price protection or product return rights to our customers  except for warranty returns 
where a product fails to comply with its limited warranty  we can either replace the product or provide the customer with a refund of the purchase price or credit against future purchases 
historically  returns arising from warranty issues have been infrequent and immaterial 
accordingly  we expense warranty returns as incurred 
while such returns have been immaterial in the past  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rate of warranty claims as we have in the past 
any significant increase in product warranty claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which the claims occur 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are reduced by an estimated allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
on an ongoing basis  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon the customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we also continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that are identified  we use our judgment to establish and evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for estimated credit losses  which was  at december  while credit losses have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  these losses can vary from period to period   and  in  and  respectively 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we will experience credit losses at the same rates as we have in the past 
also  at december   approximately million  or of our accounts receivable  was due from two major customers 
any significant changes in the liquidity or financial position of these customers  or others  could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we continually evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in the opinion of 
table of contents management  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  either a reserve is established against the inventories carrying value or the inventories are completely written off 
we base these decisions on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements over the next twelve months and the expiration dates of raw materials and finished goods 
during  and  we wrote off inventory which had a cost of approximately   and million  respectively  as a result of scrap levels and product expiration issues 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the carrying value of our inventories and reported operating results 
long lived and intangible assets 
our long lived assets are comprised of property and equipment and an investment in a nonaffiliated entity  and our intangible assets primarily consist of patents and product rights 
together  these assets have a net book value of approximately million or of our total assets at december  our investment in a privately held nonaffiliated company is recorded under the cost method of accounting because we do not have a controlling interest in this company nor do we have the ability to exert significant influence over the operating and financial policies of this investee company 
property and equipment  patents and product rights are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which we determine based upon our estimate of the period of time over which each asset will generate revenues 
an impairment of long lived or intangible assets could occur whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger an asset impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of an asset or in our strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  shortening of product life cycles or changes in technology  and negative financial performance of the nonaffiliated investee company 
if we believe impairment of an asset has occurred  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the net book value of the affected assets to the fair value of these assets  which is generally determined based upon the present value of the expected cash flows associated with the use of these assets 
if the net book value exceeds the fair value of the impaired assets  we would incur an impairment expense equal to this difference 
we currently believe the future cash flows to be received from our long lived and intangible assets will exceed their book value and  as such  we have not recognized any impairment losses through december  any unanticipated significant impairment in the future  however  could have a material adverse impact to our balance sheet and future operating results 
deferred tax assets 
at december   we have federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million 
the net deferred tax asset associated with these nols and other temporary differences is approximately million at december  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon our cumulative and recent history of losses and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized  we believe that a full valuation allowance is necessary at december  our level of future profitability could cause us to conclude that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realizable 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset and would begin to provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates at that time 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into various contractual relationships with strategic corporate partners  customers  distributors  research laboratories and universities  licensors  licensees  suppliers  vendors and other parties 
as such  we could be subject to litigation  claims or assessments arising from any or all of these relationships 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 

table of contents requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires that we use our best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
certain relationships and related transactions in connection with the announcement in march that mike gausling  our former president and chief executive officer  intended to retire from the company by the end of  we entered into a transition agreement with mr 
gausling  which replaced and terminated his employment agreement 
in june  mr 
gausling resigned from his position as president  chief executive officer and a member of the board  and his successor was named 
pursuant to his transition agreement  mr 
gausling remained an employee of our company through december  during  mr 
gausling received an annual base salary of  received full executive benefits under our group health and other benefit arrangements and earned a cash bonus under our self funding annual bonus plan 
mr 
gausling was also granted a non qualified option to purchase  shares of common stock  pursuant to our stock award plan 
during  mr 
gausling will receive salary continuation payments in an aggregate amount of  payable in four equal installments at the end of each fiscal quarter during if mr 
gausling elects to obtain continuing coverage under our health benefit plan pursuant to cobra beginning january   we will reimburse mr 
gausling for the cost of his cobra premiums for the month period ending december  we have entered into a commercial lease the lease with tech iii partners  llc tech partners  which provided for the construction of a  square foot facility on land adjacent to our bethlehem  pennsylvania headquarters  and the lease of that facility to us 
tech partners is owned and controlled by mr 
gausling  the company s former president and chief executive officer  and dr 
r 
sam niedbala  the company s former executive vice president and chief science officer 
the facility houses manufacturing and administrative operations required to support the expected growth of our business 
construction of the facility was completed in october the lease  as amended  has an initial ten year term ending in october and a base rent starting at  and increasing to  per year over that term 
the base rental rate may be increased after the fifth year of the initial term in order to reflect changes in the interest rate on debt incurred by tech partners to finance construction of the leased facilities 
we have not guaranteed any debt incurred by tech partners 
the lease also provides us with options to renew the lease for an additional five years at a rental rate of  per year  and to purchase the facility at any time during the initial ten year term based on a formula set forth in the lease 
prior to deciding to enter into the lease and an amendment increasing the base rental to reflect the cost of certain tenant fit out improvements  our board of directors retained imperial realty appraisal llc  an independent commercial real estate appraisal firm  to evaluate the proposed base rental rate 
imperial realty issued opinions indicating that the annual base rent set forth in the lease  as amended  is below the market rental rate we could otherwise expect to pay to lease a comparable commercial property in the same general geographic market 
the terms of the lease are otherwise substantially similar to a commercial lease we entered into with a third party for our existing bethlehem  pennsylvania headquarters 

table of contents in january  we terminated the employment agreement with robert d 
thompson  our former chief executive officer  and mr 
thompson entered into a severance agreement pursuant to which mr 
thompson received approximately  we also held a  note receivable previously made to mr 
thompson in connection with his relocation from portland  oregon  which was repaid during recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  which amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
sfas no

additionally  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overhead costs be based on normal capacity 
sfas no

the implementation of sfas no

in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no

sfas no 
r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service period 
the requirements of sfas no 
r are effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  sfas no 
r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition 
the company is considering the potential implementation of different valuation models to determine the fair value of stock based compensation and  therefore  has not yet completed evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
r on its results of operations 
if the company had applied the provisions of sfas no 
r to the financial statements for the period ending december   net loss would have increased by approximately million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not hold any amounts of derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and  accordingly  we have no material derivative risk to report under this item 
our holdings of financial instruments are comprised of certificates of deposit  commercial paper  us government and agency obligations  state and local government agency obligations  and us corporate bonds 
all such instruments are classified as available for sale securities 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
if changes in interest rates would affect the investments adversely  we could decide to hold the security to maturity or sell the security

we typically invest in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum 
we do not currently have any foreign currency exchange contracts or purchase currency options to hedge local currency cash flows 
we have operations in the netherlands  which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of revenues and expenses for these operations from euros to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results
