overview the year ended december  was an outstanding year for us 
we drilled a record wells during  of which were completed  resulting in a success rate and significantly increased production and reserves 
in  gross production increased  to bcfe  while net production after production payment delivery obligations that do not contribute to cash flow from operating activities increased compared to natural gas and oil reserves increased to bcfe as of december  compared to bcfe as of december  in total  we added bcfe of proved reserves during  of which was through the drill bit 
total oil and gas capital expenditures were million 
in  we continued to execute our strategies of focusing on low risk development and exploitation drilling in our core operating areas and to commit approximately of our capital expenditure budget to moderate risk  higher potential exploration prospects primarily in the onshore gulf coast region 
in  we plan to commit approximately to of our capital expenditure budget to such exploration projects 
we continue to focus primarily on natural gas prospects 
we have continued our disciplined hedging program designed to protect against price declines while participating to a large extent in future price increases 
in this way  we endeavor to ensure that we generate a sufficient level of cash flow to carry out a capital expenditure program sufficient to at least replace our expected production and still benefit if prices rise 
we further strengthened our financial condition in and provided additional financial flexibility by completing a million senior notes offering 
the new senior notes bear interest at an annual rate of and mature in the proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem our million senior subordinated notes due  including an early redemption premium  and to repay the million outstanding under our bank credit facility 
as of december   we had million of cash on hand and million of unused committed borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility 
we plan to maintain a conservative capital structure 
please read note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our senior notes and our bank credit facility 
in the mid continent region  we concentrate our drilling programs primarily in north louisiana  east texas  oklahoma anadarko and arkoma basins and west texas 
our mid continent region operations provide us with a solid base for production and reserve growth 
we plan to continue to exploit areas within the various basins that require low risk exploitation wells for additional reservoir drainage 
our exploitation wells are generally step out and extension type wells with moderate reserve potential 
during  we drilled wells in this region with a success rate of 
in  we plan to drill to wells in this region  approximately half of which are planned in the elm grove field which is our largest field 
we will also pursue drilling programs in the sawyer canyon  joaquin  terryville and talihina fields and have budgeted million to commence development of the properties being acquired in april in the gulf coast region  we concentrate our drilling programs primarily in south texas 
we also have working interests in several minor non operated offshore and mississippi salt basin properties 
we conduct development programs and pursue moderate risk  higher potential exploration drilling programs in this region 
our gulf coast operations have numerous exploration prospects that are expected to provide us additional growth 
during  we drilled exploratory and development wells in this region with a success rate of 
we anticipate drilling to wells in this region in  approximately three fourths of which will be exploratory 
in  exploration success was achieved in the la reforma and coquat fields 
in the third quarter of  we acquired a  acre lease on the o connor ranch and license to approximately square miles of d seismic data in goliad county  texas 
the drilling program will be concentrated in o connor ranch  la reforma  coquat and austin deep fields and the west mission valley area 
we believe that the steps taken over the last several years position us to continue growing our reserves and production through a balanced investment program including low risk exploitation and development activities in the mid continent and gulf coast regions and moderate risk  higher potential exploration drilling programs primarily in the onshore gulf coast region 
major influences on results of operations oil and natural gas prices 
oil and natural gas prices have been  and are expected to continue to be  volatile 
prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  and a variety of additional factors beyond our control  including  among others  worldwide political conditions especially in the middle east and other oil producing regions  the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the level of consumer demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall domestic and global economic conditions 
the average price we receive for our natural gas production is generally to cents below nymex prices at the henry hub 
the primary factors for this differential are the geographic locations of our producing properties and the btu content of our natural gas 
the average btu content of our natural gas is in excess of  btu per cubic foot 
the price we receive for our oil production is generally to per barrel below the koch west texas intermediate posted prices for sweet crude in texas new mexico 
we use commodity derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
our strategy is to maintain a disciplined approach by layering in a series of derivative contracts at different price levels depending on market conditions and other factors 
we typically target hedging to of our near term production 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
excluding the effect of impact of the terminated derivative instruments discussed below  hedging activities decreased realized prices by and in and  respectively and increased realized prices by in certain terminated derivative instruments also affect our reported realized prices 
in february  we terminated per mmbtu swaps on million mmbtu through that we inherited when we acquired medallion california properties company and related entities 
this resulted in a million hedge loss that is being amortized as a non cash reduction of revenue over the original term of the derivative instruments 
the effect of this amortization of the cost of these terminated swaps was to reduce realized prices by  and per mcfe in  and  respectively 
our reported realized prices for oil and natural gas are also affected by the production payment we sold in february at a weighted average discounted price realized of per mcfe which has the effect of lowering our reported realized price in periods when cash prices exceed per mcfe and raising our reported realized prices when cash prices are lower than per mcfe 
the effect of the production payment was to reduce realized prices by per mcfe and per mcfe in and  respectively  and to increase realized prices by per mcfe in production 
the primary factors affecting our production levels are capital availability  the success of our drilling program and  in  the sales of certain non core properties and the winding down and expiration of our purchased vpp program 
in  our main objective was to position ourselves to meet our senior note obligations that were due in january in order to do so  we curtailed our capital spending program and sold certain non core producing properties 
as a result of the property sales and curtailed drilling  our production declined significantly compared to in and  we were able to direct our cash flow to our drilling operations and significantly grow production levels and natural gas and oil reserves 
in  bcfe  or  of our production was derived from our purchased vpp program 
we have not made any vpp investments since final deliveries under our existing vpps were received in november although specific terms of our vpps varied  we were generally entitled to receive delivery of the scheduled oil and natural gas volumes at agreed delivery points  free of drilling and lease operating expenses and free of state production taxes 
during the life of the program  we invested million to acquire reserves of bcfe of natural gas and oil and realized approximately million from the sale of oil and natural gas acquired as well as an additional bcfe under a vpp that was converted to a working interest 
our reported production includes volumes dedicated to the production payment discussed below 
however  we view the net production after our delivery obligations associated with the production payment as more important because it is net production that generates cash flow 
for example  while total production increased  from bcfe in  to bcfe in  our net production actually increased  from bcfe in  to bcfe in as delivery obligations associated with the production payment declined from bcfe in to bcfe in this bcfe less production committed to the production payment obligations in resulted in incremental cash flow of approximately million 
sale of production payment 
in february  we sold a production payment in connection with our emergence from chapter the net proceeds from this sale of approximately million was recorded as deferred revenue and is amortized over the five year period that scheduled deliveries of production are made 
deliveries under this production payment are recorded as non cash oil and gas revenue with a corresponding reduction of deferred revenue at the weighted average discounted price realized of approximately per mcfe 
we also reflect the production volumes and depletion expense as deliveries are made 
however  the associated oil and natural gas reserves are excluded from our oil and natural gas reserve data 
amortization of deferred revenue comprised  and of our oil and gas revenue during  and  respectively 
as of december   bcfe remained to be delivered under the production payment of which bcfe will be delivered in and bcfe in operating costs 
we monitor our business to control costs from both a gross dollar standpoint and from a per unit of production perspective 
we are able to control our lease operating expenses because we are focused in certain core areas which allows us to operate efficiently 
lease operating expenses were million in  million in and million in these costs reflect the levels of production and workover activities and  in  increased service costs experienced by the oil and gas industry 
in order to measure our operating performance  we monitor lease operating expenses on a per unit of production basis 
lease operating expenses excluding production from purchased vpps per mcfe were in  in and in general and administrative expenses are monitored closely with the objective of operating an efficient organization with an appropriate cost structure 
in  we reduced our staff in response to limited capital availability and curtailed drilling activity 
in and  we added staff modestly in response to our resumed growth 
general and administrative expenses were million  or per mcfe  in  million  or per mcfe  in and million  or per mcfe  in factors affecting comparability sale of emission credits 
we sold emission credits totaling million in which are reflected in other  net in our statements of consolidated operations 
we did not sell any emission credits in and only a minor amount in we currently do not anticipate any significant emission credit sales in stock compensation 
stock compensation was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these non cash expenses reflect the amortization of restricted stock grants and expenses associated with certain stock options granted in that are subject to variable accounting 
the stock option expenses can fluctuate significantly as the expense recognized during a reporting period is directly related to the movement in the market price of our common stock during that period 
redemption premium on early extinguishment of debt 
on may   we redeemed our million senior subordinated notes due pursuant to the indenture  we paid an early redemption premium of million  which was charged against earnings in the second quarter of income taxes 
during the second quarter of  uncertainty resulting from relatively low commodity prices and the january maturity date for our senior notes led management to increase the valuation allowance against net deferred income tax assets by million 
this increase in the valuation allowance reduced the carrying value of net deferred assets to zero and was reflected as income tax expense on our statements of consolidated operations 
since that time  we have generated significant levels of taxable income due to drilling success and strong natural gas and oil prices 
we believe that the future outlook for continued generation of taxable income is positive based on existing available information  including prices quoted on the new york mercantile exchange and our production levels 
during  we reversed approximately million of the valuation allowance and in reversed the remaining million of the valuation allowance related to expected taxes on future years taxable income 
these amounts are reflected as an income tax benefit in our statements of consolidated operations 
in  while we continue to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and pay alternative minimum tax of approximately to of pre tax income  we anticipate that we will record book income tax expense close to the statutory corporate income tax rate of 
accounting changes 
our results included a million charge against earnings related to our change to the unit of production method of accounting for depreciation  depletion and amortization 
this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax 
in  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and recorded a million charge against earnings as a cumulative effect of an accounting change  net of tax 
there were no accounting changes that affected us in critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of each of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following discussion details the more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations the accounting for our business is subject to accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities i the successful efforts method  and ii the full cost method 
we have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties 
under this method  we capitalize all acquisition  exploration and development costs into one country wide cost center 
these costs include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  completion  equipment  certain salaries and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities 
these costs are then amortized over the remaining life of the aggregate oil and natural gas reserves using the unit of production method of calculating depletion expense discussed below under amortization of oil and gas properties 
the full cost method embraces the concept that dry holes and other expenditures that fail to add reserves are intrinsic to the oil and gas exploration business and are therefore capitalized 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  they are part of a program from which we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
as a result  we believe the full cost method of accounting is appropriate and accurately reflects the economics of our programs for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
under the successful efforts method  costs of exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs that would be capitalized under the full cost method would be charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur 
accordingly  our financial position and results of operations may have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any oil and natural gas reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also may change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  as we use the unit of production method of calculating depletion expense  the amortization rate of our capitalized oil and gas properties incorporates the estimated units of production attributable to the estimates of proved reserves 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in large part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
the estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves have been audited or prepared by netherland  sewell associates  inc  independent petroleum engineers 
amortization of oil and gas properties effective january   we began amortizing the capitalized costs related to our oil and gas properties under the unit of production  or uop  method using proved oil and natural gas reserves 
under the uop method  the depreciation  depletion and amortization rate is computed based on the ratio of production to total reserves 
this rate is applied to the amortizable base of our oil and gas properties the net book value of oil and gas properties less the costs of unevaluated oil and gas properties plus estimated future costs to develop the oil and gas properties with proved reserves 
the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization requires the use of significant estimates pertaining to oil and natural gas reserves and future development costs 
bad debt expense we routinely review all material trade and other receivables to determine the timing and probability of collection 
many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties we operate 
therefore  we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings 
we market the majority of our production and these receivables are generally collected within a month 
the receivables for the remaining production are typically collected within two months 
we accrue a reserve for a receivable when  based on the judgment of management  it is doubtful that the receivable will be collected in full and the amount of any reserve required can be reasonably estimated 
revenue recognition oil and natural gas revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at fixed or determinable prices  when delivery has occurred and title has transferred and collection of the revenue is probable 
we follow the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenues 
under this method of accounting  revenues are recognized based on actual production volume sold 
the volume of natural gas sold may differ from the volume to which we are entitled based on our wi 
an imbalance is recognized as a liability only when the estimated remaining reserves will not be sufficient to enable the under produced owner s to recoup its entitled share through future production 
natural gas imbalances can arise on properties for which two or more owners have the right to take production in kind 
in a typical gas balancing arrangement  each owner is entitled to an agreed upon percentage of the property s total production 
however  at any given time  the amount of natural gas sold by each owner may differ from its allowable percentage 
two principal accounting practices have evolved to account for natural gas imbalances 
these methods differ as to whether revenue is recognized based on the actual sale of natural gas sales method or an owner s entitled share of the current period s production entitlement method 
we have elected to use the sales method 
if we used the entitlement method  our reported revenues may have been materially different 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in making this assessment  we perform an extensive analysis of our operations to determine the sources of future taxable income 
the analysis consists of a detailed review of all available data  including our budget for the ensuing year  forecasts based on current as well as historical prices  and the independent petroleum engineers reserve report 
the determination to establish and adjust a valuation allowance requires significant judgment as the estimates used in preparing budgets  forecasts and reserve reports are inherently imprecise and subject to substantial revision as a result of changes in the outlook for prices  production volumes and costs  among other factors 
it is difficult to predict with precision the timing and amount of taxable income we will generate in the future 
our current net operating loss carryforwards aggregating approximately million have remaining lives ranging from to years 
however  we examine a much shorter time horizon  usually two to three years  when projecting estimates of future taxable income and making the determination as to whether the valuation allowance should be adjusted 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to remove equipment and restore land at the end of oil and natural gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
estimating future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments as most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and because contracts and regulations often contain vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations requires us to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of tangible long lived assets in the periods in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  we increase the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to the fair value at the time of settlement over the useful life of the asset  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
in addition  increases in the discounted asset retirement obligation resulting from the passage of time will be reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
derivatives we use commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we account for our commodity derivative contracts in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas no 
realized gains and losses from our cash flow hedges  including terminated contracts  are generally recognized in oil and natural gas production revenue when the hedged volumes are produced and sold 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
results of operations income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change for increased to million compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in natural gas and oil production increase in net production contributing to cash flow from operating activities and a increase in natural gas and oil prices  partially offset by lower non oil and gas revenue  higher operating expenses and a million redemption premium associated with the early redemption of our senior subordinated notes due in income tax benefit for was million compared to million in due to changes in our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset

for further information  please read  major influences on results of operations 
natural gas revenue 
in  natural gas revenue increased million  to million  compared to million in as a result of a increase in production and a increase in realized natural gas prices 
the production increase was primarily due to our successful drilling program 
in  natural gas revenue increased million  to million  compared to million in as a result of a increase in realized natural gas prices and a decrease in production 
the production decrease was primarily due to the expiration of our vpp program  as new production from the successful drilling program essentially offset the impact of property sales and the natural decline of producing wells 
oil and liquids revenue 
in  oil and liquids revenue increased million to million due to a increase in average realized prices  partially offset by an decrease in production 
in  oil and liquids revenue increased million to million due to a increase in average realized prices offset by a decrease in production 
the decrease in oil and natural gas liquids production reflected the natural decline associated with our oil and natural gas liquids properties as our drilling program over the last several years has been focused almost entirely on natural gas prospects 
other  net 
in  other  net was a loss of million  of which million was due to losses associated with certain derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to sfas no 
this compares to other  net revenue of million in which was primarily attributed to the sale of emission reduction credits 
other  net was million in compared to a net cost of million in the increase was primarily attributed to the sale of emission reduction credits 
we do not anticipate that there will be any significant sales of emission credits in lease operating expenses for the year ended december   lease operating expenses  or loe  increased million  to million  compared to million in due to generally higher service costs experienced industry wide and the increase in the number of producing wells as a result of our expanded drilling program 
on a per unit of production basis  loe was per mcfe of wi production in compared to per mcfe in for the year ended december   loe increased million  to million  compared to million in the increase was primarily attributed to a higher level of workover activity on oil and gas wells in on a per unit of production basis  loe was per mcfe of wi production in compared to per mcfe in production and other taxes production and other taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased production severance taxes due to higher oil and gas revenue and higher ad valorem taxes due to the higher value of our oil and gas properties 
production and other taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to higher oil and natural gas revenue and higher production tax rates in louisiana where we significantly increased our production in the elm grove field 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  or g a  increased million to million in  compared to million in primarily due to increased costs to comply with corporate governance initiatives mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of and the new york stock exchange and higher insurance costs 
on a per unit of the production basis  g a was per mcfe in and g a decreased million to million in  compared to million in on a per unit of production cost basis  g a was per mcfe for and for the overall decrease resulted from lower labor costs associated with a reduced work force  partially offset by a higher incentive compensation expense resulting from improved operating results 
stock compensation stock compensation reflects the non cash expense associated with stock options issued in that are subject to variable accounting in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  or fin  and the non cash expense associated with the amortization of restricted stock grants 
under variable accounting for stock options  the amount of expense recognized during a reporting period is directly related to the movement in the market price of our common stock during that period 
for  stock compensation was million compared to million in stock compensation was million in compared to million in primarily due to the significant increase in the market price of our common stock during accretion of asset retirement obligation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
accretion of our asset retirement obligation was million in and million in depreciation  depletion and amortization we amortize our oil and gas properties using the uop method based on proved reserves 
for the year ended december   depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million per mcfe compared to million per mcfe for the year ended december  this million increase reflects the higher production associated with our successful drilling program and the increased cost of drilling wells 
for the year ended december   depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million per mcfe compared to million per mcfe for the year ended december  this million decrease was primarily attributable to reduced production as a result of the expiration of our vpp program and the sale of certain non core oil and gas properties in interest and other income interest and other income was million in compared to million in and million in these amounts primarily represent interest income earned on accumulated cash and cash equivalents 
redemption premium on early extinguishment of debt on may   we redeemed our million senior subordinated notes due pursuant to the indenture  we paid an early redemption premium of million  which was charged against earnings in the second quarter of interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in this significant decrease in interest expense in reflects reduced amounts of average outstanding debt and substantially lower borrowing costs 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the higher interest expense in reflects the million write off of deferred financing costs and a million early termination fee paid to a previous lender as a result of amending and restating our bank credit facility in november to increase availability and reduce future interest costs 
interest expense excluding amortization of deferred financing costs was million lower in compared to primarily due to lower average outstanding debt in income taxes income tax benefits were million in compared to million in and income tax expense of million in these amounts reflect changes in our valuation allowance against net deferred income tax assets 
in making our assessment of the valuation allowance  we perform an extensive analysis of our operations to determine the sources of future taxable income 
the analysis consists of a detailed review of all available data  including our budget for the ensuing year  forecasts based on current as well as historical prices  and our oil and gas reserve report 
during the second quarter of  uncertainty resulting from relatively low commodity prices and the january maturity date for our senior notes led management to increase the valuation allowance by million 
this increase in the valuation allowance reduced the carrying value of net deferred assets to zero 
since that time  we have generated significant levels of taxable income due to drilling success and strong natural gas and oil prices 
we believe that the future outlook for continued generation of taxable income is positive based on existing available information  including current prices quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
therefore  during  we reversed approximately million of the valuation allowance and in reversed the remaining million of the valuation allowance related to expected taxes on future years taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are for the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  operating expenses and debt service 
we expect to fund our drilling activities primarily with internally generated cash flow and to have sufficient capital resources available to allow us the flexibility to be opportunistic with our drilling program and to fund larger acquisitions and working capital requirements 
we believe this approach allows us to maintain an appropriate capital structure that allows us to increase our oil and gas reserves and to reduce debt per mcfe 
in  we accelerated our drilling program given the relatively high oil and gas price environment and drilled wells with a success rate 
as a result  we were able to significantly increase oil and gas production  reserves and cash flow 
cash used in investing activities  primarily for our drilling program  was million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million 
proceeds from our senior notes offering discussed below funded the remainder of our drilling program 
in april  we completed a private placement of million of senior notes due the net proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem our million senior subordinated notes due  to repay the million outstanding under our bank credit facility and for general corporate purposes  including our drilling program 
on may   we redeemed our million senior subordinated notes due pursuant to the indenture  we paid an early redemption premium of million 
please read note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our senior notes  including a discussion of restrictive covenants 
we also have a bank credit facility that currently provides up to million of revolving credit capacity and matures on november  there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of december  borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base currently million and is reviewed at least semi annually and may be adjusted based on the lenders valuation of our oil and natural gas reserves and other factors 
please read note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our bank credit facility  including a discussion of restrictive covenants 
in february  we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire certain oil and gas properties and related assets for approximately million  subject to certain purchase price adjustments 
the transaction is subject to due diligence and other conditions prior to closing  which is scheduled to occur in mid april we expect to initially finance the acquisition with cash on hand and borrowings under our bank credit facility 
please read note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding this acquisition 
in  we have budgeted approximately million for capital investments in natural gas and oil properties  excluding the cost of acquisitions  and anticipate drilling approximately wells 
we expect to fund our exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows 
the amount and allocation of our capital investment program is subject to change based on operational developments  commodity prices  service costs  acquisitions and numerous other factors 
generally  we do not budget for acquisitions 
our net working capital position as of december  was a deficit of million 
on that date  we had million of unused availability under our bank credit facility and million of cash on hand 
working capital deficits are not unusual in our industry 
we  like many other oil and gas companies  typically maintain relatively low cash reserves and use any excess cash to fund our capital expenditure program or pay down borrowings under our bank credit facility 
the december  working capital deficit was higher than usual due mainly to the high level of accrued drilling costs million as a result of our active drilling program 
we believe that cash on hand  net cash generated from operations and unused committed borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility will be adequate to fund our capital expenditure program and satisfy our liquidity needs 
in the future  we may also utilize various financing sources available to us  including the issuance of debt or equity securities under our shelf registration statement or through private placements 
our ability to complete future debt and equity offerings and the timing of these offerings will depend upon various factors including prevailing market conditions  interest rates and our financial condition 
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for was million compared to million in the improvement in our cash flow in was primarily due to higher production  higher realized oil and natural gas prices and decreased delivery obligations under the production program 
the net increase in trade accounts receivable also reflects the higher natural gas and oil price environment in and the timing of cash receipts for sales of our increased production 
the net change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is primarily attributable to our expanded drilling program 
net cash provided by operating activities for was million compared to million in the improvement in our cash flow in was primarily due to higher realized oil and natural gas prices and substantially less production dedicated to repayment of the production payment 
the net increase in trade accounts receivable reflects the higher natural gas and oil price environment in and the timing of cash receipts 
the net change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is primarily attributable to increased drilling well pre payments received from non operating working interest owners and higher incentive compensation accruals

provides interpretive guidance on how full cost companies should reflect asset retirement obligations  or aro  in their full cost ceiling and depreciation  depletion and amortization expense calculations 
sab no 
requires future cash outflows associated with settling aro s that have accrued on the balance sheet to be excluded from the computation of the present value of estimated future net revenues for purposes of the full cost ceiling calculation 
sab no 
also requires the inclusion of the estimated amount of aro that will be incurred as a future development activity on proved reserves in the costs to be amortized 
since we were already applying the provisions of sab no 
 there was no impact on us after adoption 
on december   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb statement no 
revised share based payment  or sfas r  which is a revision of sfas statement no

commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is to oil and natural gas prices  which have historically been volatile 
realized prices are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and regional spot prices for natural gas production 
we have utilized  and may continue to utilize  derivative contracts  including swaps  futures contracts  options and collars to manage this price risk 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
while these derivative contracts are structured to reduce our exposure to decreases in the price associated with the underlying commodity  they also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from price increases 
we maintain a system of controls that includes a policy covering authorization  reporting and monitoring of derivative activity 
as of december   we had derivative instruments outstanding covering million mmbtu of natural gas production  million mmbtu of natural gas production and million barrels of oil production  with a fair market value of million 
in addition  we had commodity basis swaps outstanding covering million mmbtu 
as of december   we had derivative instruments outstanding covering million mmbtu of natural gas production and million barrels of oil production  with a fair market value of million

commodity price swaps 
commodity price swap agreements require us to make payments to  or entitle us to receive payments from  the counter parties based upon the differential between a specified fixed price and a price related to those quoted on the new york mercantile exchange for the period involved 
futures contracts 
oil or natural gas futures contracts require us to sell and the counter party to buy oil or natural gas at a future time at a fixed price 
option contracts 
option contracts provide the right  not the obligation  to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price 
by buying a put option  we are able to set a floor price for a specified quantity of our oil or natural gas production 
by selling a call option  we receive an upfront premium from selling the right for a counter party to buy a specified quantity of oil or natural gas production at a fixed price 
price collars 
selling a call option and buying a put option creates a collar whereby we establish a floor and ceiling price for a specified quantity of future production 
buying a call option with a strike price above the sold call strike establishes a way collar that entitles us to capture the benefit of price increases above that call price 
commodity basis swaps 
commodity basis swap agreements require the us to make payments to  or receive payments from  the counterparties based upon the differential between certain pricing indices and a stated differential amount
