item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial statement restatement in a review of its accounting treatment of various interest rate swaps  the company has determined that it is necessary to restate its previously issued financial statements for periods ending on or prior to september  in its review of its accounting policies  the company determined that the accounting for its interest rate swaps did not comply with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap 
although management believes the economics of the interest rate swaps achieved the original objectives of converting certain variable rate debt to effectively fixed rate obligations  certain technical documentation requirements for hedge accounting under financial accounting standards board fas statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related interpretations were not met 
historically  the company treated these interest rate swaps as embedded derivatives part of debt agreements and did not separately record these derivatives as assets liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
as a result  the company disclosed the variable rate borrowings as fixed rate obligations as if they were altered by the interest rate swap agreements 
since these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives must be recorded in the company s income statement as an income expense in the period that such changes occurred 
these non cash fair value adjustments have the effect of decreasing net income for periods prior to january  by approximately  decreasing net income by approximately  for the year ended december   increasing net income by approximately  for the year e nded december  and increasing net income for the nine months ended september  by approximately  there is no effect on historical or future net cash flows provided by operating activities

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the company s financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgment and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
for a detailed description of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
management has discussed each of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
real estate investments the company applies financial accounting standards board statement no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  statement to measure impairment in real estate investments 
rental properties are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis without interest from a rental property is less than its historical net cost basis 
these expected future cash flows consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred  rental properties are reduced to their fair value 
for properties to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property  less the estimated co st to sell  is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time there is a commitment to sell the property and or it is actively being marketed for sale 
a property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value  less its cost to sell 
subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition  depreciation expense is not recorded 
securities available for sale investments in non real estate assets consist primarily of marketable securities 
management reviews our marketable securities for impairment on a periodic basis when events or circumstances occur 
if a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recognized against earnings and the cost basis of the individual security shall be written down to fair value as the new cost basis 
management s evaluation includes consideration of events that may be attributable to the unrealized loss  including  among other things  the credit worthiness of the issuer  length of time that a security had a continuous unrealized loss  the financial position of the issuing company  and the period of expected recovery in value 
other estimates are used when accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  potentially excess and obsolete inventory and contingent liabilities  among others 
these estimates are susceptible to change and actual results could differ from these estimates 
the effects of changes in these estimates are recognized in the period they are determined

r  share based payments  which establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions with employees  and carries forward without change prior guidance for share based payments for transactions with non employees 
sfas no 
r eliminates the intrinsic value measurement objective in apb opinion no 
and generally requires an issuer to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires grant date fair value to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
such cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period which is usually the vesting period 
the standard also requires an issuer estimate the number of instruments that will ultimately be issued  rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
this statement is effective for reporting periods beginning aft er june  an issuer is required to use either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  an issuer must recognize compensation cost for all awards granted after the adoption of the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that are outstanding on that date 
under the modified retrospective method  an issuer must restate previously issued financial statements to recognize the amounts previously calculated and reported on a pro forma basis  as if the prior standard had been adopted 
under both methods  an issuer is permitted to use either a straight line or an accelerated method to amortize the cost as an expense for awards with graded vesting 
the company will utilize the prospective method on a straight line basis 
this statement will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk

if prime increased or decreased by  the company believes its interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately  based on the balance of long term debt outstanding at december  the company also has approximately thousand in variable rate debt due on demand 
this debt primarily consists of inventory financing loans 
the interest rates on these loans range from to at december  the carrying value of the company s variable rate debt approximates fair value at december  the company invests in both debt and equity securities of other reits and is primarily exposed to equity price risk from adverse changes in market rates and conditions

to reduce exposure of the debt securities portfolio to market rate fluctuations  the company invests in futures contracts of ten year treasury notes 
these contracts are marked to market with changes in market recognized in income
