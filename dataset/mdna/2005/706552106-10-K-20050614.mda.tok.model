item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the selected financial data section of this report and our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
the forward looking statements in this discussion regarding the electronics manufacturing services industry  our expectations regarding our future performance  liquidity and capital resources and other non historical statements in this discussion include numerous risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
see cautionary statements below 
overview we provide a comprehensive range of global engineering  product design  automation and test  manufacturing and fulfillment services to customers in the communications  computing and data storage  industrial equipment  and medical industries 
we provide these services on a global basis through strategic locations in the americas  asia and europe 
these customer solutions support our customers products from initial development and design through manufacturing to worldwide distribution and aftermarket support 
pemstar was founded in january by a group of eight senior ibm managers who had led the storage product operations at ibm s rochester  minnesota facility 
we have maintained a significant relationship with ibm  which remains our largest customer 
since our inception  we have diversified our customer base to include industry leading and emerging original equipment manufacturers 
we have also expanded our geographic presence  enhanced our product and service offerings and increased our volume production capabilities 
our key growth initiatives have been the opening of facilities in guadalajara  mexico  navan  ireland  singapore  hortolandia  brazil  yokohama  japan  and bangkok  thailand and the acquisition of established businesses in almelo  the netherlands  san jose  california  dunseith  north dakota  taunton  massachusetts  mountain view  california  and chaska  minnesota 
recently  we have completed expansions in our austin  texas and tianjin  china operations as well as entered into a joint venture start up agreement in brasov  romania as of april  these growth initiatives have given us expanded geographic presence in established and emerging markets and strengthened our presence in target industries  enhanced product and service offerings in our chosen geographies  while allowing us to offer cost effective manufacturing and engineering capabilities  access to new customers or additional business from existing customers  and specialized product design  automation and test and manufacturing customer solutions 
our sales are generally derived from master supply and manufacturing agreements  with current demand evidenced by purchase orders  or from specific purchase orders for discrete projects 
we charge our customers separately for engineering and manufacturing services 
we recognize revenues from product sales  net of product returns and warranty costs  typically at the time of product shipment 
in limited circumstances  although the product remains in our facilities  
table of contents we recognize revenue when title to  and risks and rewards of ownership of  the products have contractually passed to the customer 
revenue from services is recognized as they are performed and collection is reasonably certain 
our sales from engineering services  which include process test and automation equipment and prototype development  accounted for  and of our total net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
manufacturing services  including process test and automation equipment and prototype production  accounted for  and of our total net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
our cost of goods sold includes the cost of components and materials  labor costs and manufacturing overhead 
the procurement of raw materials and components requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of these items 
our production volumes are based on purchase orders for the delivery of products 
these orders typically do not commit firm production schedules for more than to days in advance 
we work to minimize the risk of obsolete inventory by ordering materials and components only to the extent necessary to satisfy existing customer orders 
to the extent our orders of materials and components for specific jobs exceed products ultimately delivered to our customers and they are not held fully responsible for our excess inventory  due to their financial condition or business relationship considerations  we may incur a charge for inventory obsolescence for the excess inventory 
we believe we are largely protected from the risk of inventory price increases  because we generally can pass these costs through to our customers 
our operating results are also impacted by the level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities  indirect manufacturing labor  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
during periods of high capacity utilization  our gross margins and operating margins generally improve  while during periods of lower capacity utilization  our gross margins and operating margins generally decline 
our infrastructure will support substantially higher levels of sales than our current net sales 
reduction in production space during fiscal and and increases in our austin  texas and tianjin  china facilities during fiscal were made in response to market conditions in the affected geographies 
we continue to evaluate market conditions and capacity requirements and will make appropriate adjustments as needed 
results of operations the table below sets forth certain operating data expressed as a percentage of our net sales for the years indicated year ended march  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring operating loss other income expense net interest expense loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change income tax benefit expense loss before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net loss fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales our net sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal these totals include sales of excess inventory of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sales of excess inventory include proceeds from the return of excess inventory at cost to customers under the terms of sales contracts 
excluding inventory sales  fiscal sales were up by million when compared to fiscal increased sales resulted from expanded operations with an existing customer of million  increased orders 
table of contents from our largest customer of million  and winning new business from new and existing customers primarily in the industrial and communications sector 
this increase was  offset by the phase out of certain underperforming consumer projects in the communications and computing and data storage markets 
sales to the medical industry also decreased primarily as a result of customer project life cycles and transitions 
specifically  industrial sales were up million  offset by a decrease in sales of million in our computing and data storage business  million in our communications sector and million in medical 
industrial equipment industry net sales increased to of sales from in fiscal this large increase is chiefly a result of a full year of operations in austin  texas operations accounting for million of growth over fiscal net sales to the computer and data storage industry decreased to of sales versus a year ago and net sales to the medical industry were of sales compared to in fiscal net sales to communication customers for fiscal decreased as a percentage of total sales to of sales compared to in fiscal included in these changes in sales by market was an increase in our engineering services sales to of net sales from in fiscal engineering services includes sales from our product development  test and automation projects 
the company s five largest customers for fiscal accounted for approximately of net sales with ibm accounting for and applied materials comprising of fiscal sales 
gross profit our gross profit decreased million in fiscal to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal both fiscal years include sales of excess inventories at cost of materials and cause our gross profit percentage from total net sales to be lower than if no such sales were included in that period 
the gross margin excluding inventory sales would have been and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the lower sales to communications customers resulted in decreased gross profit of million 
our gross profit to the industrial market decreased million on overall higher sales  however was impacted by a lower margin mix of projects and a slowing of semi conductor capital equipment orders in the second half of the fiscal year 
these decreases were offset by improved margin performance in our medical and computing and data storage business of million and million respectively 
included in these changes in gross profit was a significant decline in gross profit at one of our product development operations compared to the prior year due to the delay of a major project 
we anticipate the project to resume in fiscal also included in the gross profit changes are increased inventory write downs of million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  we continued our planned restructuring efforts including the reduction of headcount and consolidation of certain facilities to further reduce our cost structure 
the facilities and headcount infrastructure may result in additional under absorbed capacity if sales volumes decrease 
we will continue to monitor and take actions in order to balance our cost structure to the anticipated level of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal we incurred charges for accounts receivable of million in fiscal due to uncertainty of collection of accounts receivable from emerging companies and customers in bankruptcy compared to million in fiscal other factors affecting the selling  general  and administrative expenses were higher accounting and audit fees of million  expanded asia operations of million  salaries and benefits of million  full year expenses associated with the austin  texas operations of million  and increased legal fees of million 
corporate restructuring initiatives and site resource reorganizations during fiscal were taken to reduce selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal restructuring costs in fiscal  we recognized restructuring costs of million related to numerous actions taken to reduce our cost structure compared to million in fiscal the actions include  but are not limited to  personnel severance costs of million  consolidation of certain facilities and lease commitments of million and write offs of certain assets of million 
these actions were taken due to continued sluggish end market demand and a slow down in semi conductor capital equipment orders leading to increased excess capacity and net losses in the americas region 
the actions taken were to close our hortolandia  brazil and taunton  massachusetts facilities and eliminate surplus space in rochester  minnesota and chaska  minnesota 
in addition  we combined overhead infrastructure resources in our midwest and west coast operations 
we also eliminated positions from americas and corporate operations 
these position eliminations ranged from production workforce to senior management 
savings related to facility consolidations  overhead reorganizations and headcount reductions during fiscal are expected to be million annually 
amortization amortization of other intangibles was and million in fiscal and as of april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of this statement resulted in no amortization being taken in fiscal or for new or existing goodwill on the balance sheet  however  it did result in an impairment charge of million at the april  transition date for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  which has been reflected in the fiscal net loss 

table of contents other income expense other income  net  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this change in other income was primarily a result of a gains losses on sale of land and other assets million in fiscal offset by reduced million currency exchange gains in certain foreign locations compared to fiscal amounts 
interest expense interest expense increased million to million in fiscal from million expense in fiscal this increase largely reflects increased borrowings under our asian credit facilities 
income tax expense benefit the income tax benefit was million in fiscal compared to expense of million in fiscal the low effective tax rate for fiscal is a result of no tax benefits being recognized on operating losses in the united states  mexico and netherlands 
our effective income tax rate in these countries will continue to be low until these operations are profitable 
in addition  we have tax holidays and reduced rate benefits in singapore  china and thailand  which caused our effective rate to be low 
as these holidays expire  we expect the effective rate to increase 
the fiscal benefit includes special claims for prior taxes paid of million in china based upon reinvested profits and million of deferred tax assets recorded related to prior operating loss carryforwards of currently profitable operations in israel 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales our net sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal these totals include sales of excess inventory of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
excluding inventory sales  fiscal sales were up by million when compared to fiscal increased sales resulted from expanded operations with an existing customer of million and increased orders from existing customers of million 
this increase was  offset by decreased sales in the communications market of million due to continued sluggish demand in our optical and infrastructure business and new product transitions with wireless handset customers 
sales to the medical industry also decreased primarily as a result of customer project life cycles and transitions 
specifically  industrial sales were up million  computing and data storage sales were up million  offset by a decrease in sales of million in our communications business and million in medical 
over the year  we continued to diversify our revenue base within the industries we serve 
industrial equipment industry net sales increased to of sales from in fiscal this large increase is chiefly a result of our expanded austin  texas operations which accounted for million in fiscal net sales to the computer and data storage industry increased to of sales versus a year ago and net sales to the medical industry were of sales compared to in fiscal net sales to communication customers for fiscal decreased as a percentage of total sales to of sales compared to in fiscal again  this decrease resulted from challenging economic conditions facing the communications industry due to lower demand 
the company s five largest customers for fiscal accounted for approximately of net sales with ibm accounting for of fiscal sales 
gross profit our gross profit increased million in fiscal to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal this increase was due to a change in sales mix including increased sales and higher gross profit industrial customers for million  increased sales to our computing and data storage customers adding million 
these increases were somewhat offset by lower gross margin associated with our decreased communications business accounting for a million decrease  and lower sales to higher margin medical customers  accounting for a decrease in gross profit of million compared to the prior year 
included in these changes in gross profit by market was cost savings from restructuring actions and lower inventory write downs of million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  we continued our planned restructuring efforts including the reduction of headcount and consolidation of certain facilities to further reduce our cost structure 
the facilities and headcount infrastructure may result in additional under absorbed capacity if sales volumes decrease 
we will continue to monitor and take actions in order to balance our cost structure to the anticipated level of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses increased slightly to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal we incurred charges for accounts receivable of million in fiscal due to uncertainty of collection of accounts receivable from emerging companies and customers in bankruptcy compared to million in fiscal other factors affecting the selling  general  and administrative expenses were new expenses associated with the austin  texas operations of million  higher information technology it costs from continued worldwide it implementations of million  increased domestic employee benefit costs of million  and higher commissions associated with the different sales mix of million  partially offset by savings from restructuring efforts 
restructuring costs in fiscal  we recognized restructuring costs of million related to numerous actions taken to reduce our cost structure compared to million in fiscal the actions include  but are not limited to  personnel 
table of contents severance costs of million  consolidation of certain facilities and lease commitments million for fiscal actions and million of adjustment to fiscal action provisions  and write offs of certain assets of million 
savings related to facility consolidations and headcount reductions during fiscal were million 
these savings are reflected in the discussion above with respect to gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses 
amortization amortization of goodwill and other intangibles were million in fiscal and as of april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of this statement resulted in no amortization being taken in fiscal or for new or existing goodwill on the balance sheet  however  it did result in an impairment charge of million at the april  transition date for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  which has been reflected in the fiscal net loss 
other income expense other income  net  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this change in other income was primarily a result of higher currency exchange gains in certain foreign locations of million 
interest expense interest expense decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease largely reflects reduced and fewer bank and waiver fees on our domestic lines of credit of million 
income tax expense benefit the income tax expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the low effective tax rate for fiscal is a result of no tax benefits being recognized on operating losses in the united states  mexico and netherlands 
our effective income tax rate in these countries will continue to be low until these operations are profitable 
in addition  we have tax holidays in singapore  china and thailand  which caused our effective rate to be low 
as these holidays expire  we expect the effective rate to increase liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations from the proceeds of bank debt  private and public offerings of equity and convertible debt  cash generated from operations and lease financing of capital equipment 
historically  our principal uses of cash have been to fund our working capital needs  business acquisitions  expanded operations  capital expenditures and debt service requirements 
we anticipate these uses will continue to be our principal uses of cash in the future 
net cash provided by used in operating activities for fiscal   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal improved significantly due to decreased levels of accounts receivable generating million  lower inventories accounting for million  and decreased prepaid expenses providing million 
these increases resulted from decreased requirements given customer sales volume reductions in late fiscal and sales of excess inventories during fiscal these increases were offset by a net loss of million and a lower accounts payable balances accounting for million  again related to customer purchase requirements 
depreciation expense  which is non cash reconciling item to the net loss was million for fiscal the cash cycle consisting of days sales outstanding and days inventories held less days of open payables  was days in fiscal compared to days in fiscal customer accounts receivable and inventory held are believed to be recoverable based upon the ongoing review of customer credit worthiness  the strength of customer contracts and our review of our own operating business practices 
the net cash used in operating activities for fiscal increased significantly due to increased levels of inventories accounting for million and accounts receivable accounting for million 
the cash cycle lengthened to days in fiscal from days in fiscal primarily due to the inventory needed to support the significant growth in our industrial business in the second half of fiscal the net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal increased significantly due to decreased levels of inventories accounting for million  accounts receivable providing million and increased levels of accounts payables producing million from a focus on the cash cycle 
the cash cycle improved from days in fiscal to days in fiscal improving our liquidity 
in addition  net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal as a result of lower operating losses 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in fiscal were million in fiscal or a decrease of million as compared to the prior fiscal year 
capital expenditures were principally used for expanding asia operations  including million in our china facility 
in fiscal  our cash used in investing activities included million used to pay additional purchase price for pacific consultants llc  completing payment of all conditional obligations in this agreement 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal or an increase of million as compared to the prior fiscal year 
capital expenditures were principally used for expansion of our china facility accounting for million 
in fiscal  
table of contents our cash used in investing activities included million used to pay additional purchase price for pacific consultants llc  due after the first anniversary of the purchase 
the original purchase agreement provides for additional purchase price  payable in cash or common stock  of up to million if earnings targets are met for the acquired business in the two years following the close  which will be recognized as additional goodwill 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal or a decrease of million as compared to the prior fiscal year 
capital expenditures were principally used for upgrades in certain facilities for manufacturing machinery and equipment and information technology equipment 
net cash used in provided by financing activities for fiscal   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
our principal use of cash in financing activities in fiscal was due to slightly greater pay down of borrowings compared to borrowings advanced 
our principal provider of cash in financing activities in fiscal was million from stock sales  during the second quarter of fiscal  when pemstar completed an offering of million shares of its common stock 
our principal use of cash in financing activities in fiscal included a net decrease of revolving credit facilities and long term borrowings of million offset by proceeds from the sale and leaseback of equipment of million and our worldwide headquarters facility in rochester  mn of million 
as of march   we had total borrowings of million  made up of million of revolving credit facilities  debt obligations totaling million and capital lease obligations of million 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
within the revolving credit facilities  we had approximately million outstanding under our domestic credit facilities  million outstanding under our icbc industrial commercial bank of china credit facility  million under our krung thai bank facility  and million outstanding under local facilities in europe and asia 
liquidity  which is defined as worldwide cash plus available domestic borrowing capacity  was million 
as of april   pemstar entered into a three year  million revolving credit facility to replace its facility with ibm credit and us bank 
this new facility  as amended  is with wachovia capital finance corporation and bank of america na formerly fleet national bank of connecticut 
this bank agreement provided a larger facility with generally more favorable terms 
the bank agreement was amended on october  to provide more favorable interest rates and extended the expiration of the domestic credit limit agreement to april at march   pemstar entered an agreement with krung thai bank public company limited  which included million of revolving credit collateralized by customer purchase orders and other debt obligations of up to million 
in china  pemstar maintains relationships with several banks  which provide for million of facilities available for short term financing notes  which are renewable 
banking arrangements in singapore and the netherlands provide an additional million of available funding on a short term basis with renewable terms 
all of these credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets 
domestic credit facilities include a covenant to attain minimum earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  for domestic and worldwide operations 
these domestic agreement covenants do not apply however  if we maintain at least million in available domestic borrowing capacity 
as of march   we had million of available domestic borrowing capacity 
we are required under certain foreign credit facilities to meet various financial covenants  including minimum location net worth  maximum debt to equity ratios  and minimum location net income  all of which we were in compliance with at march  our continued viability depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain additional sources of funds for working capital 
our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity depends  in part  on our achieving anticipated revenue targets  improving working capital management and intended expense reductions from our restructuring activities 
we believe  as a result of the restructuring actions we have taken in fiscal  and to reduce cash expenditures  the efforts we continue to make to increase revenues from continuing customers  as well as efforts to generate new customers in various industry sectors  continued focus on working capital management  and our new revolving credit facilities  which provides additional borrowing capacity  that we have sufficient cash flow to meet our needs for fiscal we may not achieve these targets  realize the intended expense reductions or improve working capital levels 
if our operating goals are not met  we may be required to secure waivers of any resulting covenant violations under existing lending facilities  secure additional financing from lenders or sell additional securities 
we regularly review acquisition and additional facilities expansion or joint venture opportunities  as well as major new program opportunities with new or existing customers  any of which may require us to sell additional equity or secure additional financing in order to fund the requirement 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
we cannot provide assurance that financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts  such as debt agreements  lease agreements  and unconditional purchase obligations 
the following table represents contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments of the company as of march  amounts in thousands total due in fiscal due in fiscal due in fiscal due in fiscal due in fiscal due thereafter revolving credit facilities other long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations domestic revolving credit facilities of  included above will not require repayment on a current basis  provided that credit facility covenants continue to be met or minimum excess borrowing capacity is maintained 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements amounts in thousands committed total amounts amount of commitment expiration year years years years years over years standby letters of credit the outstanding standby letters of credit are in support of our domestic workers compensation program and a building lease in our san jose facility 
there are no additional off balance sheet financing arrangements employed during fiscal  and critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and adjustments  including those related to returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
bad debts the company has a diverse customer base 
the creditworthiness of customers is evaluated before sales are approved 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on past history  current economic conditions and the composition of its accounts receivable aging  and in some instances  makes allowances for specific customers based on several factors  such as the creditworthiness of those customers and payment history 
actual write offs may differ from the allowances for doubtful accounts  and this difference may have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
inventories we value our inventories on a first in  first out basis at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
given the volatility of the markets in which the company operates  the company makes adjustments to its value of inventories based on estimates of potentially excess and obsolete inventory after considering customer forecasted demand  forecasted average selling price and its ability to sell excess inventory quantities back to its customers within contract terms 
however  forecasts are subject to revisions  cancellations  and rescheduling 
actual demand will inevitably differ from such anticipated demand  and such differences may have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations  if additional write offs are required 

table of contents goodwill and intangible impairment effective april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this standard  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
this standard also requires  at a minimum  that we perform an annual assessment of the carrying value of these assets 
if the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized 
during the year ended march   we recorded a million impairment loss as the transition date cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  included herein 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these cash flow estimates take into account current customer volumes and the expectation of new or renewal projects  historic gross margins  historic working capital parameters and planned capital expenditures 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying value of long lived may not be recoverable 
long lived assets are considered not recoverable when the carrying amount of a long lived asset asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset asset group 
if we determine that a long lived asset asset group is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset asset group over the long lived asset s asset group s fair value 
fair value is the amount at which the long lived asset asset group could be bought or sold in a current transaction between a willing buyer and seller  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
income taxes in determining the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  we must assess the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income in related tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions to realize the benefit of these assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates quarterly whether the deferred tax assets may be realized and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances or reduction of existing allowances quarterly 
we recorded million and million of additional valuation allowances in the years ended march  and  respectively  related to our net deferred tax assets  bringing the total allowance to million as of march  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revision to statement no 
revised  share based payment 
statement r will  with certain exceptions  requires entities that grant stock options and shares to employees to recognize the fair value of those options and shares as compensation cost over the service vesting period in their financial statements 
the measurement of that cost will be based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
statement r is required to be adopted by the company in the first interim period beginning after our fiscal year as part of this adoption  the company will begin expensing its options effective april  and has also elected to not restate prior period results 
since the company will continue to issue stock options to employees as a form of incentive compensation and because the company has outstanding stock options that will vest on or after april   the adoption of this fasb is expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements  but has not yet determined the impact 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
the guidance in apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged

 however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends apb no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the company is currently assessing the impact of the provisions 
the provision of sfas no 
is effective in periods beginning after june  the company does not believe that the adoption of the provisions of sfas no

cautionary statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws that may include statements regarding intent  belief or current expectations of pemstar inc and our management 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement 
we desire to take advantage of these safe harbor provisions 
accordingly  we hereby identify the following important factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from any such results which may be projected  forecast  estimated or budgeted by us in forward looking statements made by us from time to time in reports  proxy statements  registration statements and other written communications  or in oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our officers and agents 
the following list is not exhaustive and we disclaim any obligation to subsequently revise any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
risks relating to our business and industry reductions in demand and other factors have caused net losses 
the continuing reduction in capital spending by businesses for new technologies  the remaining effects of the recent recession and the market disruptions caused by the september terrorist attacks in the united states and threats of hostilities in the middle east and asia have reduced demand in many of the technology markets we serve 
as a result of these market conditions  we experienced a significant reduction in demand for our services during fiscal  continuing through fiscal with some effects for us lingering through fiscal a new recession  additional outbreaks of hostilities or any other events leading to excess capacity or a continued or increased downturn in the markets we serve would likely negatively affect our net sales 
in addition  the communications  computing and data storage  industrial and medical equipment markets of the electronics manufacturing services industry are characterized by intense competition  relatively short product life cycles and significant fluctuations in product demand 
these markets are also subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
if any of these factors or other factors reduce demand for specific products or components that we design or manufacture for our customers  our net sales would likely be negatively affected 
due to these market conditions and factors  we may experience net losses in future periods 

table of contents we depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales and the loss of any of our major customers would harm us 
we depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales 
our two largest customers in fiscal were ibm and applied materials  which represented approximately of our total net sales 
in addition  our ten largest customers in fiscal accounted for approximately of our net sales 
we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net sales 
because our major customers represent such a large part of our business  the loss of any of our major customers could negatively impact our business 
our major customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels or at all 
in the past  we have lost customers due to the acquisition of our customers  product discontinuation and customers shifting production of products to internal facilities 
we may lose customers in the future for similar reasons 
we may not be able to expand our customer base to make up any sales shortfalls if we lose a major customer 
our attempts to diversify our customer base and reduce our reliance on particular customers may not be successful 
our business has been adversely affected by reductions or delays in customer orders 
we do not typically obtain firm long term purchase orders or commitments from our customers 
we work closely with our customers to develop forecasts for future orders  but these forecasts are not binding 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities from forecast volumes or delay production for a number of reasons beyond our control 
any material delay  cancellation or reduction of orders from our largest customers could cause our net sales to decline significantly and could result in us holding excess inventories of components and materials 
in fiscal  these and similar factors caused us to recognize charges for inventory reserves and adjustments of million 
we may be required to recognize similar charges in future periods 
many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed 
as a result  a reduction in customer demand can decrease our gross profit and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to satisfy the financial covenants under our worldwide credit facilities  our availability may be limited or we may have to obtain alternative sources of financing 
we have historically experienced violations of covenants under our revolving credit facilities and have been required to seek waivers for such violations 
compliance with these covenants in our credit facilities or maintaining a minimum excess borrowing capacity  which provides an exemption from domestic covenant maintenance  is dependent upon us achieving certain revenue and expense targets in our fiscal operating plan 
if we do not comply with these covenants or if we default on our payment obligations under other debt obligations  our availability under our credit facilities could be reduced or our lenders could declare a default under the credit facilities 
in the event of a default or a substantial reduction of availability  we would be required to obtain alternative financing  which could be more expensive than our current arrangement  be dilutive to existing shareholders and divert management s time and attention 
moreover  we cannot assure that we would be able to obtain alternative financing on favorable terms and on a timely basis  if at all 
our failure to meet any of our covenants under our credit facilities could significantly harm our liquidity and financial position 
we require additional sources of funds for working capital 
our continued viability depends on our ability to generate additional cash from operations or obtain additional sources of funds for working capital 
our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity depends  in part  on our achieving anticipated revenue targets and intended expense reductions from our restructuring activities 
we may not achieve these targets or realize the intended expense reductions 
if our operating goals are not met  we will be required to secure additional financing from lenders or sell additional securities 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital when we want or need it  and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms 
if we issue additional equity securities or convertible debt to raise capital  it may be dilutive to your ownership interest 
in addition  any additional capital may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business  such as financial or operating covenants 
we have been unable to collect all our accounts receivable 
falling demand for the products of our technology customers and liquidity difficulties for these companies have forced us to reach accommodations with a portion of our customers and have at times limited our ability to collect fully our accounts receivable from these customers in fiscal and in addition  several significant customers in recent years have 
table of contents filed for bankruptcy protection  which limits our recovery of accounts receivable from these customers 
in fiscal  these and similar factors caused us to recognize charges for accounts receivable adjustments of million 
we may be required to recognize similar charges in future periods 
our acquisition strategy may not succeed 
as part of our business strategy  we have acquired other companies  assets or product lines that complement or expand our existing business 
these acquisitions have not been entirely successful  and in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred approximately million of goodwill impairment charges related to facilities acquired by us in the past three years 
as a result of implementing new accounting pronouncements in fiscal  we recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of million 
although we anticipate seeking further acquisition opportunities  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or finance and complete transactions that we select 
we may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business 
in addition  its key personnel may decide not to work for us 
we may also have difficulty in integrating acquired businesses  products  services and technologies into our operations 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and workforce  increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results 
furthermore  we may incur significant debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments 
the issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our shareholders 
failure to execute our acquisition strategy may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during periods of significant growth or restructuring  we may have trouble managing our expanded operations 
rapid growth or contraction can place a significant strain on our management  financial resources and on our information  operations and financial systems 
we face risks associated with coordinating multinational operations and reporting systems  diverse technologies and multiple products and services 
in addition  our growth has increased our expenses and working capital requirements 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  it may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
similarly  managing reduction in personnel during business restructuring can present control issues  as well 
we cannot assure you that we will manage our growth or restructuring activities effectively 
our financial condition could suffer if we fail to successfully defend shareholder lawsuits 
we have been a defendant  along with several current and former officers and directors  in a consolidated putative class action captioned in re pemstar securities litigation 
we and our board were also defendants in a consolidated shareholder derivative action that is based on many of the same facts that gave rise to the securities class action 
for further information about the nature of these actions see item in our annual report on form k for the year ended march  the securities action has been settled 
if we are not able to successfully obtain final settlement of the consolidated shareholder derivative actions or other similar actions that could arise in the future  our business and financial condition could suffer 
increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our services 
the electronics manufacturing services industry is highly competitive and characterized by low margins 
we compete against numerous us and foreign service providers with global operations  as well as those who operate on a local or regional basis 
in addition  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally 
consolidation in the electronics manufacturing services industry results in a continually changing competitive landscape 
the consolidation trend in the industry also results in larger and more geographically diverse competitors who have significant combined resources with which to compete against us 
some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial  manufacturing  engineering  technical  financial  systems  sales and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  have greater name recognition  critical mass and geographic and market presence  be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities  adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements  and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their services 

table of contents we also may be operating at a cost disadvantage as compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers  distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures 
increased competition from existing or potential competitors could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share 
we anticipate that our net sales and operating results will fluctuate which could affect the price of our common stock 
our net sales and operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
a substantial portion of our net sales in any given quarter may depend on obtaining and fulfilling orders for assemblies to be manufactured and shipped in the same quarter in which those orders are received 
further  a significant portion of our net sales in a given quarter may depend on assemblies configured  completed  packaged and shipped in the final weeks of such quarter 
our operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  including variations in customer orders relative to our manufacturing capacity  variations in the timing of shipment of products to customers  our ability to recognize revenue with respect to products held for customers  introduction and market acceptance of our customers new products  changes in competitive and economic conditions generally or in our customers markets  effectiveness of our manufacturing processes  including controlling costs  changes in cost and availability of components or skilled labor  and the timing and price we pay for acquisitions and related acquisition costs 
our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  any unanticipated shortfall in revenue in a quarter would likely adversely affect our operating results for that quarter 
also  changes in our product assembly mix may cause our margins to fluctuate  which could negatively impact our results of operations for that period 
results in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected in any future period 
it is possible that in one or more future periods our results of operations will fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  and the price of our common stock could decline significantly 
our predictions of future operating results may not be achieved 
from time to time in earnings releases and otherwise  we may publish forecasts or other forward looking statements  or comment on the estimates of financial analysts  regarding our future results  including estimated revenues or net earnings 
any forecast of  or comment on  our future performance reflects various assumptions 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties  and as a matter of course  any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
further  the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or comments or that the variation from such forecasts or comments will not be material and adverse 
you are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forward looking information  as well as other available information affecting us and our services  when evaluating our prospective results of operations 
shortages or price fluctuations in component parts specified by our customers could delay product shipments and adversely affect our profitability 
many of the products we manufacture require one or more components that we order from sole source suppliers 
supply shortages for a particular component can delay production of all products using that component or cause cost increases in 
table of contents the services we provide 
in the past  some of the materials we use  such as capacitors and memory and logic devices  have been subject to industry wide shortages 
as a result  suppliers have been forced to allocate available quantities among their customers and we have not been able to obtain all of the materials desired 
our inability to obtain these needed materials could slow production or assembly  delay shipments to our customers  increase costs and reduce operating income 
in certain circumstances  we may bear the risk of periodic component price increases 
accordingly  some component price increases could increase costs and reduce our operating income 
in addition  if we fail to manage our inventory effectively  we may bear the risk of fluctuations in materials costs  scrap and excess inventory  all of which adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are required to forecast our future inventory needs based upon the anticipated demand of our customers 
inaccuracies in making these forecasts or estimates could result in a shortage or an excess of materials 
a shortage of materials could lengthen production schedules and increase costs 
an excess of materials may increase the costs of maintaining inventory and may increase the risk of inventory obsolescence  both of which may increase expenses and decrease our profit margins and operating income 
if we are unable to respond to rapidly changing technologies and process developments  we may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and continuing process developments 
the future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  to develop and market products and services that meet changing customer needs and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
our core technologies could in the future encounter competition from new or revised technologies that render existing technology less competitive or obsolete or that reduce the demand for our services 
we cannot assure you that we will effectively respond to the technological requirements of the changing market 
if we determine that new technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the development  acquisition and implementation of these technologies may require us to make significant capital investments 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain capital for these purposes in the future or that investments in new technologies will result in commercially viable technological processes 
the loss of revenue and earnings to us from these changing technologies and process developments could adversely affect us 
operating in foreign countries exposes us to increased risks  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently have foreign operations in china  ireland  israel  japan  mexico  the netherlands  romania  singapore and thailand some of which have incurred continuing losses 
there is a risk that such losses may be ongoing or require a discontinuance of operations 
in such an event  we may not be able to do so without incurring additional losses 
we may in the future expand into other international regions 
we have limited experience in managing geographically dispersed operations and in operating in foreign countries 
we also purchase a significant number of components manufactured in foreign countries 
because of the scope of our international operations  we are subject to the following risks  which could adversely impact our results of operations economic or political instability  transportation delays and interruptions  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  increased employee turnover and labor unrest  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  incompatibility of systems and equipment used in foreign operations  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel and diverse cultures  and less developed infrastructures 

table of contents in addition  changes in policies by the united states or foreign governments could negatively affect our operating results due to increased duties  increased regulatory requirements  higher taxation  currency conversion limitations  restrictions on the transfer of funds  the imposition of or increase in tariffs and limitations on imports or exports 
also  we could be negatively affected if our host countries revise their policies away from encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade  including tax holidays 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property  or we may be deemed to be infringing the intellectual property rights of others  either of which would negatively affect our ability to compete and our results 
we rely on our proprietary technology  and we expect that future technological advances made by us will be critical to remain competitive 
therefore  we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is  and will continue to be  important to the success of our business 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology 
we cannot be certain that patents we have or that may be issued as a result of our pending patent applications will protect or benefit us or give us adequate protection from competing technologies 
we also cannot be certain that others will not develop our unpatented proprietary technology or effective competing technologies on their own 
from time to time  third parties including our customers and competitors  may assert patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us 
in this regard  in august  we were named as defendant in one of a number of actions currently being pursued by the lemelson foundation partnership based on alleged infringements of patent rights it claims in certain imaging analysis technology 
the litigation has been stayed pending the resolution of other litigation  to which we are not a party  asserting the invalidity and or unenforceability of certain lemelson patents 
patents held by other companies  including lemelson  may be determined to be valid  and some of our products may ultimately be determined to infringe the patents or other intellectual property of other companies 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with respect to intellectual property rights relevant to our products  we could be required to obtain licenses to the infringing technology  to pay substantial damages under applicable law  to cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products or to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
licenses may not be available from third parties  either on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention  even if we ultimately prevail 
accordingly  any infringement claim or litigation against us could significantly harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business could suffer if we lose the services of  or fail to attract  key personnel 
our future success largely depends on the skills and efforts of our executive management and our engineering  manufacturing and sales employees 
we do not have employment contracts or non competition agreements with any of our executive management or other key employees 
the loss of services of any of our executives or other key personnel could negatively affect our business 
our continued growth will also require us to attract  motivate  train and retain additional skilled and experienced managerial  engineering  manufacturing and sales personnel 
we face intense competition for such personnel 
we may not be able to attract  motivate and retain personnel with the skills and experience needed to successfully manage our business and operations 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws  which expose us to potential financial liability 
our operations are regulated under a number of federal  state  provincial  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  which govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling  storage and disposal of such materials 
compliance with these environmental laws is a significant consideration for us because we use metals and other hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes 
we may be liable under environmental laws for the cost of cleaning up properties we own or operate if they are or become contaminated by the release of hazardous materials  regardless of whether we caused the release 
in addition  we  along with any other person who arranges for the disposal of our wastes  may be liable for costs associated with an investigation and remediation of sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes  if such sites become contaminated  even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws 
in the event of contamination or violation of environmental laws  we could be held liable for damages including fines  penalties and the costs of remedial actions and could also be subject to revocation of our discharge permits 
any such penalties or revocations could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities  thereby harming our business 

table of contents failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial results and have a material adverse impact on our business and stock price 
effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports our operating results could be harmed 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  areas of our internal controls that need improvement 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments 
during the course of this assessment with respect to our fiscal year ended march   we identified several material weaknesses in our system of internal control which weaknesses we are now trying to remediate 
failure to successfully identify and remediate material weaknesses in our system of internal control could affect the accuracy of our financial reporting which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price when any such inaccuracies are discovered and disclosed 
risks relating to our common stock the market price of our common stock could fluctuate in response to quarterly operating results and other factors 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future in response to quarterly operating results and other factors  including many over which we have no control and that may not be directly related to us 
the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
fluctuations or decreases in the trading price of our common stock may adversely affect your ability to trade your shares and you may lose all or part of your investment 
in addition  these fluctuations could adversely affect our ability to raise capital through future equity financings 
future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline and may cause dilution to our existing shareholders 
as of may   our directors  executive officers and largest shareholder beneficially owned an aggregate of  shares  or  of our common stock 
in addition  substantially all of our outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradable without restriction or further registration 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our shareholders or even the potential for such sales  may cause the market price of our common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities 
as noted above  we may need additional funding  which may be raised through issuances of equity securities and securities convertible into equity securities  to provide us with the capital to reach our objectives 
we also have the right to issue  at the discretion of our board of directors  shares upon such terms and conditions and at such prices as our board of directors may establish 
in addition  we may in the future issue preferred stock that might have priority over our common stock as to distributions and liquidation proceeds 
such offerings would dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders and could cause a dilution of the net tangible book value of such shares 
provisions in our charter documents and minnesota law may delay or prevent an unsolicited takeover effort to acquire our company  which could inhibit your ability to receive an acquisition premium for your shares 
provisions of our amended articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and provisions of minnesota law may delay or prevent an unsolicited takeover effort to acquire our company on terms that you may consider to be favorable 
these provisions include the following no cumulative voting by shareholders for directors  a classified board of directors with three year staggered terms the ability of our board to set the size of the board of directors  to create new directorships and to fill vacancies the ability of our board  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock  which may have rights and preferences that are superior to our common stock  
table of contents the ability of our board to amend the bylaws  a shareholder rights plan  which discourages the unauthorized acquisition of or more of our common stock or an unauthorized exchange or tender offer  restrictions under minnesota law on mergers or other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock  and a requirement that at least two thirds of our shareholders and at least two thirds of our directors approve certain amendments of our articles of incorporation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the variable rates associated with our borrowings 
on march   we had total borrowings of million bearing variable interest rates 
an adverse change of one percent in the interest rate of all borrowings  which bear interest at variable rates  would cause us to incur a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
foreign currency exchange risk fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of countries other than the us in which we conduct business could adversely affect our financial results 
except for sales in the netherlands  ireland  israel  romania and china  our sales are principally denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have relatively limited exposure to foreign currency exchange risk on our sales 
for fiscal  sales denominated in euros totaled million and sales denominated in chinese renminbi totaled million 
costs related to these sales are largely denominated in their respective currencies  thereby limiting our transaction risk exposures 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  and if we price our products and services in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products and services in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices being uncompetitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
the reported results of our foreign operations will be influenced during their translation into us dollars by currency movements against the us dollar 
the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar from march   and levels relative to each of the currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of approximately million  million and million  respectively  for the fiscal years ended march   and at march  and  the amount we consider permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and translated into dollars using the year end exchange rate was million and million  respectively  and the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical strengthening in the value of the us dollar currency exchange rate amounts to million and million  respectively 
actual amounts may differ 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  however  we may hedge such exposures in the future 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not dependent upon moderate changes in the inflation rate
