table of contents our results of operations as a result of completing the gulfterra merger on september   our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended december  includes three months of results of operations from the gulfterra assets 
the effective closing date of our purchase of the south texas midstream assets was september   thus  our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended december  includes four months of results of operations from the south texas midstream assets 
as a result of the gulfterra merger  we have reorganized our reportable business segments  as described below 
we have also revised our prior segment information in order to conform to the current business segment operations and presentation 
we have segregated our business activities into four reportable business segments offshore pipelines services  onshore natural gas pipelines services  ngl pipelines services  and petrochemical services 
our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the type of services rendered and products produced and or sold 
for a listing of the major components of each of our four new business segments  and the principal operating assets included within each of the major components  please read note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
the offshore pipelines services business segment consists of i approximately  miles of offshore natural gas pipelines strategically located to serve production areas in some of the most active drilling and development regions in the gulf of mexico  ii approximately miles of gulf of mexico offshore crude oil pipeline systems and iii seven multi purpose offshore hub platforms located in the gulf of mexico  which are included in our offshore pipelines services business segment 
the onshore natural gas pipelines services business segment consists of approximately  miles of onshore natural gas pipeline systems that provide for the gathering and transmission of natural gas in alabama  colorado  louisiana  mississippi  new mexico and texas 
in addition  this segment includes two salt dome natural gas storage facilities located in mississippi  which are strategically located to serve the northeast  mid atlantic and southeast domestic natural gas markets 
this segment also includes leased natural gas storage facilities located in texas and louisiana 
the ngl pipelines services business segment includes our i natural gas processing business and related ngl marketing activities  ii ngl pipelines aggregating approximately  miles and related storage facilities  which include our strategic mid america and seminole ngl pipeline systems and iii ngl fractionation facilities located in texas and louisiana 
this segment also includes our import and export terminaling operations 
the petrochemical services business segment includes four propylene fractionation facilities  an isomerization complex  and an octane additive production facility 
this segment also includes various petrochemical pipeline systems 
the other non segment category is presented for financial reporting purposes only to reflect the historical equity earnings we received from gulfterra gp and our underlying investment in this entity at december  we acquired a membership interest in gulfterra gp on december  in connection with step one of the gulfterra merger 
our investment in gulfterra gp was accounted for using the equity method until the gulfterra merger was completed on september  on that date  gulfterra gp became a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of ours 
since the historical equity earnings of gulfterra gp were based on net income amounts allocated to it by gulfterra  it is impractical for us to allocate the equity income we received during the periods presented to each of our new business segments 
therefore  we have segregated equity earnings from gulfterra gp from our other segment results to aid in comparability between the periods presented 
we evaluate segment performance based on the non gaap financial measure of gross operating margin 
gross operating margin either in total or by individual segment is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
this measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results 

table of contents the gaap measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income 
our non gaap financial measure of total segment gross operating margin should not be considered as an alternative to gaap operating income 
we define total or consolidated segment gross operating margin as operating income before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  operating lease expenses for which we do not have the payment obligation  gains and losses on the sale of assets  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions  provision for income taxes  minority interest  extraordinary charges and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses net of the adjustments noted above from segment revenues  with both segment totals before the elimination of intercompany transactions 
we have historically included equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin and operating income 
our equity investments with industry partners are a vital component of our business strategy 
they are a means by which we conduct our operations to align our interests with those of our customers  which may be suppliers of raw materials or consumers of finished products 
this method of operation also enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed versus what we could accomplish on a stand alone basis 
many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other business operations 
our integrated midstream energy asset system including the midstream energy assets of our equity method investees provides services to producers and consumers of natural gas  ngls and petrochemicals 
our asset system has multiple entry points 
in general  hydrocarbons can enter our asset system through a number of ways  including an offshore natural gas or crude oil pipeline  an offshore platform  a natural gas processing plant  an ngl gathering pipeline  an ngl fractionator  an ngl storage facility  an ngl transportation or distribution pipeline or an onshore natural gas pipeline 
at each link along this asset system  we earn revenues based on volume or an ownership of products such as ngls 
many of our equity investees are present within our integrated midstream asset system 
for example  we have ownership interests in several offshore natural gas and crude oil pipelines through our investments in poseidon  cameron highway  deepwater gateway  neptune and nemo 
we also have a number of investments in ngl transportation or distribution pipelines such as those owned by belle rose and dixie prior to our purchasing consolidating interests in dixie in january and february 
other examples include our use of the promix ngl fractionator to process ngls extracted by our gas plants 
the ngls received from promix then can be sold in our ngl marketing activities 
given the integral nature of our equity investees to our operations  we believe treatment of earnings from our equity method investees as a component of gross operating margin and operating income is appropriate 
for additional information regarding our investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates  please read note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
for additional information regarding our business segments  please read note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
our gross operating margin by segment and in total is as follows for the periods indicated year ended december  gross operating margin by segment onshore natural gas pipelines services ngl pipelines services petrochemical services offshore pipeline services other  non segment total segment gross operating margin

refinery grade propylene represents an average of cmai spot prices 
polymer grade propylene represents average cmai contract pricing 
crude oil price is representative of an index price for west texas intermediate 
the indicative gas processing gross spread is a relative measure used by the ngl industry as an indicator of the gross economic benefit derived from extracting ngls from natural gas production on the us gulf coast 
specifically  it is the amount by which the economic value of a composite gallon of ngls exceeds the value of the equivalent amount of energy of natural gas based on ngl and natural gas prices on the us gulf coast 
it is assumed that a gallon of ngls is comprised of ethane  propane  normal butane  isobutane and natural gasoline 
the value of a composite gallon of ngls is determined by multiplying these component percentages by industry index prices listed in the table above 
the value of the equivalent amount of energy of natural gas to one gallon of ngls is of the price of a mmbtu of natural gas 
the indicative gas processing gross spread does not consider the operating and fuel costs incurred by a natural gas processing plant to extract the ngls nor the transportation and fractionation costs to deliver the ngls and natural gas to market

the following information highlights the significant year to year variances in gross operating margin by business segment  selling  general and administrative costs  and interest expense onshore natural gas pipelines services 
gross operating margin for our onshore natural gas pipelines services segment was million for compared to million for the majority of the million increase in gross operating margin for this segment is attributable to assets acquired in the gulfterra merger  including various onshore natural gas pipelines and the petal and hattiesburg natural gas storage facilities 
additionally  gross operating margin for our acadian gas pipeline system increased million period to period due to higher natural gas transportation volumes and natural gas sales margins during the natural gas throughput volumes on our acadian system were bbtus d for compared to bbtus d for ngl pipelines services 
gross operating margin from ngl pipelines services segment was million for compared to million for gross operating margin for natural gas processing increased million period to period due to improved processing economics in  the addition of gross operating margin attributable to assets acquired in the gulfterra merger  including the chaco  indian basin and south texas natural gas processing facilities  both partially offset by lower results from our ngl marketing activities in indicative gas processing gross spreads on the us gulf coast averaged cpg during compared to cpg in  which resulted in an increase in the amount of ngls extracted 
equity ngl production was mbpd for versus mbpd in natural gas processing volumes under contracts with fee based components increased to  mmcf d for from mmcf d in reflecting amendments to our natural gas processing contract mix 
gross operating margin from ngl pipelines and storage services decreased million period to period due to i a million non cash asset impairment charge we recognized in on an ngl storage facility  ii increased expenses associated with our pipeline integrity inspection program  and iii lower gross operating margin from our lou tex ngl pipeline resulting from a mbpd decrease in volumes due to our election to maximize total gross operating margin by diverting mixed ngls and refinery grade propylene to our other facilities 
partially offsetting these decreases  was improved gross operating margin from our mid america and seminole pipelines resulting from a increase in throughput volumes 
overall  net ngl transportation volumes were  mbpd for compared to  mbpd in 
table of contents gross operating margin from ngl fractionation increased million period to period 
ngl fractionation volumes were mbpd in compared to mbpd in gross operating margin from our norco facility increased by million primarily due to i a mbpd increase in volumes resulting from an expansion completed in the fourth quarter of and ii the effect of higher prices on and an increase in ngl volumes sold by norco that it earns ownership of through percent of liquids based fractionation contracts 
additionally  an increase in gross operating margin of million is attributable to the south texas fractionators which we acquired in the gulfterra merger 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in gross operating margin period to period from our mont belvieu ngl fractionator primarily attributable to the timing of gains and losses associated with the measurement of ngls in storage pending fractionation and increased operating costs due to higher natural gas prices 
petrochemical services 
gross operating margin from our petrochemical services segment was million in compared to million in gross operating margin from octane enhancement increased million period to period primarily due to i a non cash asset impairment charge of million recorded in related to our investment in bef and ii consolidating the results of bef after our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest during the third quarter of gross operating margin from propylene fractionation increased million period to period primarily due to higher petrochemical marketing sales volumes  which benefited from the effects of higher polymer grade propylene prices in offshore pipelines services 
gross operating margin for our offshore pipelines services segment was million for compared to million for the million increase in this segment is primarily attributable to assets acquired in the gulfterra merger  including various offshore oil and natural gas pipelines and offshore platforms 
partially offsetting this increase in gross operating margin is decreased equity earnings from our neptune natural gas pipeline investment resulting from a decrease in volumes from the brutus and hickory fields and natural depletion of other production fields served by this system 
selling  general and administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative costs were million for compared to million during the million increase is primarily attributable to assets acquired or consolidated during interest expense 
interest expense increased to million during from million in the million increase is primarily due to additional debt we incurred as a result of the gulfterra merger  partially offset by reduced loan cost amortization primarily related to our repayment during of the billion senior unsecured day term loan which we used to fund the acquisition of our interests in the mid america and seminole pipelines 
our weighted average debt principal outstanding was billion during compared to billion during for additional information regarding our debt obligations and changes in our debt obligations since december   please read our liquidity and capital resources our debt obligations  included within this item comparison of year ended december  with year ended december  revenues for increased billion over those recorded during likewise  costs and expenses increased billion over those of the increase in revenues and costs and expenses is primarily due to higher product sales and purchase prices and the financial results of business acquisitions  both of which offset the effect of lower volumes at some of our pipelines and facilities 
in addition  costs and expenses for includes a million loss related to commodity hedging activities 
in general  higher market prices result in increased revenues from our various marketing activities  however  these same higher prices also increase our cost of sales within these activities as feedstock and other purchase prices rise 
in addition  higher natural gas market prices during increased energy related costs for many of our businesses versus the same period in the weighted average market price of ngls was cpg during versus cpg during the market price of natural gas averaged per mmbtu during versus per mmbtu during when compared to  volumes at some of our downstream pipelines and facilities were lower due to a combination of i decreased demand for ngls  principally ethane  by the ethylene segment of the petrochemical 
table of contents industry the ethylene industry and ii lower ngl extraction rates at domestic gas processing facilities 
the most significant determinant of the relative economic value of ngls is demand by the ethylene industry for use in manufacturing plastics and chemicals 
during  this industry operated at lower utilization rates when compared to primarily due to a recession in the domestic manufacturing sector 
also during  as a result of the higher relative cost of ngls to crude based alternatives such as naphtha  the ethylene industry utilized crude based feedstock alternatives in greater quantities than during the resulting weaker demand for ngls by this industry limited the ability of ngl producers to sell at higher product prices  which in turn resulted in decreased ngl extraction rates during equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates decreased million year to year primarily due to a million decrease in equity earnings from bef 
the million decrease in equity earnings from bef is primarily due to a million asset impairment charge we recorded during the third quarter of  increased facility downtime during for maintenance and economic reasons  and an overall decrease in mtbe sales margins 
in addition to lower earnings from bef  approximately million of the overall decrease in equity earnings is due to a rate case settlement recorded by starfish in as a result of items noted in the previous paragraphs  operating income for increased million from that posted during total segment gross operating margin increased million year to year due to the same general reasons underlying the increase in operating income 
operating income includes costs such as depreciation and amortization and selling  general and administrative expenses that are excluded from the non gaap financial measure of total segment gross operating margin 
net income increased million to million for compared to million for net income for reflected the million increase in operating income discussed in the previous paragraph offset by a million increase in interest expense due to acquisition related borrowings 
the following information highlights the significant year to year variances in gross operating margin by business segment  selling  general and administrative costs  and interest expense onshore natural gas pipelines services 
gross operating margin from our onshore natural gas pipelines services segment was million for compared to million for the decrease in gross operating margin was primarily due to lower natural gas sales volumes attributable to an increase in natural gas prices period to period 
overall  natural gas throughput volumes were bbtus d during versus bbtus d during the market price of natural gas averaged per mmbtu during versus per mmbtu during ngl pipelines services 
gross operating margin from our ngl pipelines services segment was million for versus million for gross operating margin from natural gas processing increased million period to period 
our results for include million in commodity hedging losses  the underlying strategies of which were discontinued in our commodity hedging results for were a gain of million 
equity ngl production at our gas processing plants averaged mbpd during compared to mbpd during the decrease in equity ngl production year to year was largely attributable to reduced demand for ngls  principally ethane  by the ethylene industry and higher natural gas prices relative to ngl prices  which caused most natural gas processors to minimize the amount of ngls extracted at their facilities 
during  we renegotiated a number of our natural gas processing contracts 
in general  our objective has been to convert our traditional keepwhole arrangements to either margin band keepwhole contracts  percent of liquids contracts or fee based contracts 
the goal of these renegotiations is to minimize our direct exposure to the volatility of natural gas prices  especially to the extent it increases the ptr cost we would pay under traditional keepwhole arrangements to the point that processing natural gas to extract ngls becomes uneconomical for us 
when ngl extraction is uneconomical  ngls are left in the natural gas stream to the extent allowed while keeping the natural gas in compliance with pipeline quality specifications  thus reducing the amount of ngls available for downstream activities such as pipeline transportation and ngl fractionation 

table of contents gross operating margin from ngl pipelines and storage increased million period to period 
the increase in gross operating margin was primarily due to our acquisition of mid america and seminole 
these two systems earned gross operating margin of million during on aggregate net volumes of mbpd 
the period includes million in gross operating margin for the five months during that we owned interests in these systems august through december 
when compared to their historical operating rates  net pipeline transportation volumes on the mid america and seminole systems recorded for were lower than those reported by these systems for the full year of primarily due to decreased demand for ngls  principally ethane  by the ethylene industry and lower ngl extraction rates at regional gas processing facilities 
excluding the contributions of mid america and seminole  gross operating margin from ngl pipelines and storage was million for versus million for net pipeline throughput volumes excluding mid america and seminole increased to mbpd during from mbpd during the period 
gross operating margin from ngl fractionation improved million year to year 
the increase in ngl fractionation gross operating margin is primarily due to i mixed ngl measurement gains we recognized during at our mont belvieu facility and ii higher percent of liquids revenues during at norco attributable to the general increase in ngl prices  both of which more than offset a decline in gross operating margin from our other ngl fractionation facilities generally due to lower volumes and higher energy related costs 
net ngl fractionation volumes decreased to mbpd during from mbpd during the decrease in ngl fractionation volumes period to period was primarily due to lower ngl extraction rates at gas processing facilities and reduced demand for ngls by the petrochemical industry 
petrochemical services 
gross operating margin from our petrochemical services segment was million for the period compared to for the period 
gross operating margin from propylene fractionation declined million year to year primarily due to lower petrochemical marketing margins resulting from higher feedstock and energy related operating costs 
net propylene fractionation volumes were mbpd for compared to mbpd during gross operating margin from butane isomerization increased million year to year 
the increase in gross operating margin from isomerization was generally attributable to higher isomerization fees and by product revenues  which were partially offset by lower volumes and higher energy related operating costs 
isomerization volumes were mbpd during the period compared to mbpd during the period 
our equity and consolidated earnings from octane enhancement were a loss of million for compared to equity income of million during the million decrease in equity earnings is primarily due to a million impairment charge we recorded during the third quarter of for our share of an impairment charge recorded by bef  increased downtime during for maintenance and economic reasons  and an overall decrease in mtbe sales margins 
net mtbe production from this facility decreased to mbpd during from mbpd during offshore pipelines services 
gross operating margin from our offshore pipelines services segment was million for compared to million for overall  natural gas throughput volumes were bbtus d during versus bbtus d during the decrease in gross operating margin is primarily due to a million reduction in equity earnings from starfish related to the settlement of a rate case in selling  general and administrative costs 
these expenses were million for compared to million during the period includes approximately million that we paid to williams for transition services associated with our acquisition of mid america and seminole compared to million paid in for these services 
these payments ceased in february when we began operating these two pipeline systems 
interest expense

table of contents general outlook for we expect our business to be affected by the following key trends and events during our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect  our expectations may vary materially from actual results 
drilling activity in the major producing areas  including the deepwater gulf of mexico  rocky mountains and san juan  and the improving economy  have increased demand for our integrated midstream energy services 
over the next two years we expect large volumes of new production from both the deepwater and the rockies to flow into our integrated system of assets 
our natural gas and ngl facilities in central louisiana and our owned cameron highway oil pipeline began receiving first production from the mad dog and holstein developments in the southern green canyon area of the deepwater gulf of mexico 
these volumes  along with oil volumes received by our owned poseidon oil pipeline from the front runner development  should steadily increase during as these developments ramp up to full production 
in addition  we expect initial production from the k and k north fields to begin flowing into our facilities in mid as a result of the continued strong demand for ngls  most of our pipelines  fractionators and processing plants should continue to run at high utilization rates 
the strength of the domestic and global economic recoveries should continue to drive increased demand for all forms of energy despite higher commodity prices 
our largest ngl consuming customers in the ethylene industry have seen strong demand for their products  which has enabled them to raise prices to mitigate higher fuel and feedstock costs 
with the unusually high price of crude oil relative to natural gas  ethane and propane are the preferred feedstocks of the ethylene industry 
with strong demand for their products  the ethylene industry has been operating at utilization rates in excess of  which results in strong demand for all ethylene feedstocks 
as a result of the gulfterra merger  we significantly increased our midstream assets located in the gulf of mexico 
we have several projects that have either recently started operations or are scheduled to become operational soon 
for additional information regarding these projects and our other capital spending  please read our liquidity and capital resources capital spending 
the effects of hurricane ivan have reduced volumes delivered to some of our pipelines  natural gas processing and ngl fractionation facilities in eastern louisiana since the middle of september we estimate that this reduction in volumes resulted in a million decrease in gross operating margin for the year ended december  this amount is prior to any potential recoveries under our business interruption insurance 
in december  volumes to these pipelines and facilities started to increase and we expect the volumes to return to normal levels by mid our liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses and debt service  are for capital expenditures  business acquisitions and distributions to our partners 
we expect to fund our short term needs for such items as operating expenses and sustaining capital expenditures with operating cash flows 
capital expenditures for long term needs resulting from internal growth projects and business acquisitions are expected to be funded by a variety of sources either separately or in combination including cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under commercial bank credit facilities  the issuance of additional partnership equity and public or private placement debt 
we expect to fund cash distributions to partners primarily with operating cash flows 
for additional information regarding our quarterly cash distributions  please read item of this annual report 
our debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and or refinancing arrangements 
as noted above  certain of our liquidity and capital resource requirements are fulfilled by borrowings made under debt agreements and or proceeds from the issuance of additional partnership equity 
at december  
table of contents we had approximately billion in principal outstanding under various debt agreements 
for additional information regarding our debt  please read our debt obligations 
as a result of our growth objectives  we expect to access debt and equity capital markets from time to time and we believe that additional financing arrangements to support our goals can be obtained on reasonable terms 
furthermore  we believe that maintenance of an investment grade credit rating combined with continued ready access to debt and equity capital at reasonable rates and sufficient trade credit to operate our businesses efficiently provide a solid foundation to meet our long and short term liquidity and capital resource requirements

in general  we provide services for producers and consumers of natural gas  ngls and crude oil from the wellhead to the end user 
the products that we process  sell or transport are principally used as fuel for residential  agricultural and commercial heating  feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing  and in the production of motor gasoline 
reduced demand for our services or products by industrial customers  whether because of general economic conditions  reduced demand for the end products made with our products or increased competition from other service providers or producers due to pricing differences or other reasons could have a negative impact on our earnings and thus the availability of cash from operating activities

cameron highway 
in july  cameron highway entered into a million project loan facility  consisting of a million construction loan and million of senior secured notes  to finance a substantial portion of the cost to construct the cameron highway oil pipeline 
the construction loan bears interest at a variable rate 
once the cameron highway oil pipeline has commenced operations and transported a certain level of volumes as specified in the credit agreement  the construction loan will convert to a term loan maturing in july  subject to the terms of the loan agreement 
at the end of the first quarter following the first anniversary of the conversion into a term loan  cameron highway will be required to make quarterly principal payments of million  with the remaining unpaid principal amount payable on the maturity date 
if the construction loan fails to convert into a term loan by january  the construction loan and senior secured notes become fully due and payable 
at december   cameron highway had million outstanding under its construction loan at an average interest rate of the interest rate on cameron highway s senior secured notes is over the rate on year us treasury securities 
principal payments of million are due quarterly from september through december  million each from march through december  and million each from march through the principal maturity date of december at december   cameron highway had million outstanding under its senior secured notes at an average interest rate of 
the project loan facility as a whole is secured by substantially all of cameron highway s assets  including  upon conversion to a term loan  a debt service reserve capital account  and all of the equity interest in cameron highway 
other than the pledge of our equity interest and our construction obligations under the relevant producer agreements  the debt is non recourse to us 
the construction loan and senior secured notes prohibit cameron highway from making distributions to us until the construction loan is converted into a term loan and cameron highway meets certain financial requirements 
deepwater gateway 
in august  deepwater gateway  our unconsolidated affiliate which owns the marco polo tension leg platform  obtained a million project finance loan to finance a substantial portion of the cost to construct the marco polo tension leg platform and related facilities 
construction of the marco polo tension leg platform was completed during the first quarter of  and in june  deepwater gateway converted the project finance loan into a term loan which matures in june the term loan is payable in twenty equal 
table of contents quarterly installments of million each which began on september   and the remaining outstanding principal of million is due on the maturity date 
interest rates are variable and the loan is collateralized by substantially all of deepwater gateway s assets 
deepwater gateway is required to maintain a debt service reserve of not less than the projected principal  interest and fees due on the term loan for the immediately succeeding six month period 
if deepwater gateway defaults on its payment obligations under the term loan  we would be required to pay the lenders all distributions we or any of our subsidiaries have received from deepwater gateway up to million 
as of december   the average interest rate charged under this term loan was 
in accordance with terms of the credit agreement  deepwater gateway has the right to repay the principal amount plus any accrued interest due under its term loan at any time without penalty 
deepwater gateway has decided to extinguish its term loan 
we and our joint venture partner in deepwater gateway  cal dive  will make equal cash contributions to deepwater gateway to fund the repayment 
at march   the term loan principal amount owed by deepwater gateway was million 
poseidon 
poseidon is party to a million revolving credit facility which matures in january the interest rates poseidon is charged on balances outstanding under its revolving credit facility are variable and depend on its ratio of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
this credit agreement is secured by substantially all of poseidon s assets 
as of december   the average interest rate charged under poseidon s revolving credit facility was 
evangeline 
at december   long term debt for evangeline consisted of i million in principal amount of fixed rate series b senior secured notes that are due in december and ii a million subordinated note payable 
the series b senior secured notes are collateralized by evangeline s property  plant and equipment  proceeds from a gas sales contract  and by a debt service requirement 
scheduled principal repayments on the series b notes are million annually through with a final repayment in of approximately million 
the trust indenture governing the series b notes contains covenants such as requirements to maintain certain financial ratios 
evangeline incurred the subordinated note payable in connection with its acquisition of a contract based intangible asset in the early s 
this note is subject to a subordination agreement which prevents the repayment of principal and accrued interest on the note until such time as the series b note holders are either fully cash secured through debt service accounts or have been completely repaid

credit ratings our current corporate credit ratings are baa investment grade with a stable outlook as rated by moody s investor services  bb non investment grade with a positive outlook as rated by standard and poor s and bbb investment grade with a stable outlook by fitch ratings 
depending on our future operating results  these credit rating agencies may view our current levels of debt negatively 
if one or more of these credit rating agencies were to downgrade our credit standing  we could experience an increase in our borrowing costs  difficulty accessing capital markets or a reduction in the market price of our common units 
such a development could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and to refinance indebtedness 
additionally  if our credit rating by moody s declines below baa in combination with our credit rating at standard poor s remaining at bb or below  the million principal balance of our pascagoula mbfc loan  and all related accrued and unpaid interest would become immediately due and payable days following such event 
if such an event occurred  we would have to redeem the pascagoula mbfc loan or provide an alternative credit agreement to support our obligation under the pascagoula mbfc loan

we are committed to the long term growth and viability of the company 
part of our business strategy involves expansion through business combinations  growth capital projects and investments in joint ventures 
in recent years  major oil and gas companies have sold non strategic assets in the midstream energy sector in which we operate 
we forecast that this trend will continue  and expect independent oil and natural gas companies to consider similar divestitures 
management continues to analyze potential acquisitions  joint ventures and similar transactions with businesses that operate in complementary markets or geographic regions 
we believe that we are positioned to continue to grow through acquisitions that will expand our system of assets and through growth capital projects 
the combination of our operations with those of gulfterra provides us with incremental growth opportunities for both onshore and offshore projects 
we currently estimate that our capital spending over the next two to three years could approximate up to billion  primarily for growth projects in the gulf of mexico and western regions of north america 
of this amount  we expect to spend approximately million during the ability to execute our growth strategy and complete our projects is dependent upon our access to the capital necessary to fund projects and acquisitions 
our success with capital raising efforts  including the formation of joint ventures to share costs and risks  continues to be the critical factor which determines how much we actually spend 
we believe our access to capital resources is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future operating growth needs  and although we currently intend to make the forecasted expenditures discussed below  we may adjust the timing and amounts of projected expenditures as necessary to adapt to changes in the capital markets 

table of contents we estimate our forecasted expenditures based upon our strategic operating and growth plans  which are also dependent upon our ability to provide capital from operating cash flows or otherwise obtain the capital necessary to accomplish our operating and growth objectives 
these estimates may change due to factors beyond our control  such as weather related issues  changes in supplier prices or poor economic conditions 
further  estimates may change as a result of decisions made at a later date  which may include acquisitions or decisions to take on additional partners 
as previously noted  we estimate our capital spending for property  plant and equipment during to approximate million  which includes estimated expenditures of million for growth capital projects and acquisitions and approximately million for sustaining capital expenditures which result from improvements to and major renewals of existing assets 
the following table summarizes our forecasted expenditures during for announced acquisitions and significant growth capital projects in millions of dollars growth capital projects independence hub platform independence trail pipeline system constitution gathering system san juan optimization project ngl expansion projects iso octane conversion project petal conversion project acquisitions additional interests in dixie pipeline company indian springs natural gas gathering and processing assets total for information regarding these acquisitions  please read recent developments  included within this item we also expect to invest approximately million in the capital projects of our unconsolidated affiliates during as of december   we had approximately million in outstanding purchase commitments related to our share of capital projects  the majority of which pertain to pipeline and platform growth projects in the gulf of mexico 
significant announced growth capital projects prior to the gulfterra merger  gulfterra had a number of midstream energy projects underway 
in addition  we have announced various new growth capital projects that are currently underway 
the following is a discussion of our significant growth capital projects  including those acquired with in the gulfterra merger independence hub platform and independence trail pipeline system 
in november  we entered into an agreement with the atwater valley producers group consisting of anadarko  dominion  kerr mcgee  spinnaker and devon for the dedication  processing and gathering of natural gas and condensate production from several natural gas fields in the atwater valley  desoto canyon and lloyd ridge areas collectively  the anchor fields of the deepwater gulf of mexico 
we will design  construct  and own independence hub  a foot deep draft  semi submersible platform with a two level production deck  which will be capable of processing mmcf d of natural gas 
the platform  which is estimated to cost approximately million  will be operated by anadarko  and is designed to process production from its anchor fields and has excess payload capacity to support ten additional pipeline risers 
in december  we entered into an agreement with cal dive to sell them a indirect interest in the independence hub platform 
under the terms of the agreement  we will have access to cal dive s fleet of vessels  which will assist us in the construction of the independence hub platform and the related export pipeline 
independence hub platform will be located on mississippi canyon block  in a water depth of  feet 
this location was selected for the permanently anchored platform based on favorable seafloor conditions and proximity to the identified anchor fields 
first production is expected in under the terms of the 
table of contents agreement  the production fields served by the independence hub platform will include the dedicated anchor fields in addition to future discoveries on surrounding undeveloped blocks 
additionally  we will construct  own  and operate the mile independence trail natural gas pipeline system  which will have a throughput capacity of approximately mmcf d of natural gas 
the pipeline system  which is estimated to cost million  will transport production from the independence hub platform to the tennessee gas pipeline 
we entered into an agreement with tennessee gas pipeline under which they will pay us million for contributions in aid of construction to connect the independence trail natural gas pipeline system to their pipeline system 
in november  tennessee gas pipeline reimbursed us million for construction costs incurred 
the balance of million would be reimbursed by tennessee gas pipeline when additional costs are incurred and is contingent upon our completion of the independence trail project  which is expected during constitution gathering system 
in july  gulfterra entered into a definitive agreement to construct  own  and operate oil and natural gas pipelines to provide production gathering services for the constitution field  which is owned by kerr mcgee 
the constitution field is located at a depth of  feet in green canyon blocks and in the central gulf of mexico 
the new million natural gas pipeline will be a mile  inch pipeline with a transport capacity of up to mmcf d and will connect to our existing anaconda gathering system 
the new million oil pipeline will be a mile  inch pipeline with a minimum transport capacity of mbpd that will connect with the cameron highway oil pipeline and poseidon oil pipeline system at our ship shoal b platform 
these pipelines are expected to start transporting volumes in the first half of san juan optimization project 
in may  we commenced a project relating to our san juan basin assets 
this project  which is estimated to cost approximately million  is expected to be completed in stages through and will result in increased capacity of up to mmcf d on our san juan natural gas gathering system and increased market opportunities through a new interconnect at the tailgate of our chaco plant 
rocky mountain ngl pipeline expansion and related ngl fractionation projects 
in january  we started a project to expand our mont belvieu ngl fractionator to accommodate increased production of ngls being transported to mont belvieu from the rocky mountain area 
our mont belvieu facility s current fractionation capacity is up to mbpd of mixed ngls 
this project  which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of at an estimated total cost of million  will increase total fractionation capacity at this facility by mbpd and reduce its energy costs 
additionally  we are reviewing a proposal to construct a new ngl fractionator at our mont belvieu complex that could add an additional mbpd of fractionation capacity at this industry hub 
currently  the rocky mountain segment of our mid america pipeline system transports up to mbpd of ngls from the major producing basins in wyoming  utah  colorado and new mexico to the hobbs station on the texas new mexico border 
the western expansion project would increase the capacity of this pipeline to mbpd 
permitting  engineering and design work are in progress 
we submitted a draft environmental assessment and plan of development to the appropriate regulatory agencies during the first quarter of contingent upon receiving all required permits and regulatory approvals  construction could begin as early as the fourth quarter of iso octane conversion project 
as a result of environmental concerns related to mtbe  we are currently in the process of modifying our bef facility to produce iso octane  a motor gasoline octane enhancement additive derived from isobutane 
we expect iso octane to be in demand by refiners to replace the amount of octane that is lost as a result of mtbe being eliminated as a motor gasoline blendstock 
depending on the outcome of various factors including pending federal legislation the facility may be further modified in the future to produce alkylate 
petal conversion project 
in the third quarter of  we began to convert an existing brine well at our existing propane storage complex in hattiesburg  mississippi to natural gas service 
this conversion  which is expected to cost million  will create a new natural gas storage cavern with bcf of working gas capacity that will be integrated with our existing petal natural gas storage facility 
we expect to have the cavern in service during the second quarter of we have executed long term storage agreements with bp for the entire capacity of the new natural gas storage cavern

epco has assigned to us the purchase options associated with the retained leases 
during  we exercised our option to purchase an isomerization unit and in october purchased the unit at a cost of million  which approximated fair value 
additionally  in december  we purchased equipment related to the isomerization unit for million pursuant to our purchase option 
should we decide to exercise the remaining purchase options associated with the retained leases which are also at fair value  an additional million would be payable in and million in pipeline integrity costs our ngl  petrochemical and natural gas pipelines are subject to pipeline safety programs administered by the us department of transportation  through its office of pipeline safety 
this federal agency has issued safety regulations containing requirements for the development of integrity management programs for hazardous liquid pipelines which include ngl and petrochemical pipelines and natural gas pipelines 
in general  these regulations require companies to assess the condition of their pipelines in certain high consequence areas as defined by the regulation and to perform any necessary repairs 
in connection with the new regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines  we developed a pipeline integrity management program in in connection with the new regulations for natural gas pipelines  we developed a pipeline integrity management program in during  we spent approximately million to comply with these new regulations  of which million was recorded as an operating expense of our ngl pipelines services segment and million was recorded as an operating expense of our onshore natural gas pipelines services segment 
the remaining million we spent to comply with the new regulations was capitalized 
based on information currently available  our cash outlays for our pipeline integrity program associated with these new regulations are estimated to be approximately million for the forecasted cost for is net of an indemnification we will receive from el paso 
in april  gulfterra acquired several midstream assets located in texas and new mexico from el paso the epn holdings acquisition 
the assets acquired included the texas intrastate system  the permian basin system and the indian basin gas processing facility 
pursuant to an amended purchase and sale agreement between gulfterra and el paso for these assets  el paso agreed to indemnify gulfterra against all pipeline integrity costs incurred whether paid or payable with respect to the assets acquired in the epn holdings acquisition for each of the years ending december   and  to the extent that such annual costs exceed million  however  the amount reimbursable by el paso for  and shall not exceed million

recent accounting developments fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation of arb no 
addresses requirements for accounting consolidation of a variable interest entity vie with its primary beneficiary 
in general  if an equity owner of a vie meets certain criteria defined within fin  the assets  liabilities and results of the activities of the vie should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the owner 
our adoption of fin as amended by fin r in has had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
due to the complexity of fin as amended by fin r and interpreted  the fasb is continuing to provide guidance regarding implementation issues 
since this guidance is still continuing  our conclusions regarding the application of this guidance may be altered 
as a result  adjustments may be recorded in future periods as we adopt new fasb interpretations of fin eitf  participating securities and the two class method under sfas no 
this accounting guidance  which is applicable for the period beginning april   requires the two class method for calculating earnings per share for certain securities that are considered to participate in earnings with common shareholders 
under the two class method  distributions to equity owners are subtracted from earnings  and any remaining earnings would be allocated to the various classes of owners in proportion to their right to receive distributions as if those earnings had been distributed 
the total distributions to each class of owner plus the amount allocated to each class would be used to compute earnings per unit for that class 
since our distributions to owners exceeded earnings during the periods presented  as has historically been the case  the two class method did not produce any change from the way we have traditionally computed earnings per unit 
as a result  our adoption of this standard had no effect on our earnings per unit calculations 
sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this accounting guidance  which is applicable for fiscal years beginning after june   amends arb no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this accounting guidance  which is applicable for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june   replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb no 
 and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
this statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
employee share purchase plans will not result in recognition of compensation cost if certain conditions are met  those conditions are much the same as the related conditions in sfas no 
a public entity will initially measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments based on its current fair value  the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period 

table of contents the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
we are continuing to evaluate the provisions of sfas no 
r and will fully adopt the standard during within the prescribed time periods 
upon the required effective date  we will apply this statement using a modified version of prospective application as described in the standard 
our critical accounting policies in our financial reporting process  we employ methods  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements 
these methods  estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect 
the following describes the estimation risk underlying our most significant financial statement items depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment in general  depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost  less its residual value if any  to the periods it benefits 
we use the straight line method to depreciate the majority of our property  plant and equipment  which results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the assets 
we estimate depreciation based on the estimated useful lives and residual values of our assets 
as of the time we place our assets in service  we believe our estimates are accurate 
however  circumstances in the future may develop which would cause us to change these estimates and in turn would change our depreciation amounts on a going forward basis 
some of these circumstances include changes in laws and regulations relating to restoration and abandonment requirements  changes in expected costs for dismantlement  restoration and abandonment as a result of changes  or expected changes  in labor  materials and other related costs associated with these activities  changes in the useful life of an asset based on the actual known life of similar assets  changes in technology  or other factors  and changes in expected salvage proceeds as a result of a change  or expected change in the salvage market 
at december  and  the net book value of our property  plant and equipment was billion and billion  respectively 
we recorded million and million in depreciation expense during and  respectively 
a significant portion of the year to year increase in depreciation expense for and is attributable to the property  plant and equipment assets we acquired in the gulfterra merger  which were recorded at their preliminary fair values upon completion of the gulfterra merger at september  for additional information regarding our property  plant and equipment  please read notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
measuring recoverability of long lived assets and equity method investments long lived assets including intangible assets with finite useful lives and property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes might be production declines that are not replaced by new discoveries or long term decreases in the demand or price of natural gas  oil or ngls 
long lived assets with recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through future expected cash flows are written down to their estimated fair values 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the existing asset 
our estimates of such undiscounted cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including anticipated margins and volumes  estimated useful life of the asset or asset group  and salvage values 
an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the long lived asset s carrying value and its fair value  which is based on a series of assumptions similar to those used to derive undiscounted cash flows but incorporating probabilities that reflect a range of possible outcomes and market value and replacement cost estimates 

table of contents equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is a loss in value of the investment which is an other than temporary decline 
examples of such events or changes include continued operating losses of the investee or long term negative changes in the investee s industry 
the carrying value of an equity method investment is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of discounted estimated cash flows expected to be derived from the investment 
this estimate of discounted cash flows is based on a number of assumptions including discount rates  probabilities assigned to different cash flow scenarios  anticipated margins and volumes and estimated useful life of the investment 
due to a deteriorating business environment  bef evaluated the carrying value of its long lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of this review indicated that the carrying value of its long lived assets exceeded their collective fair value  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million 
since bef was one of our equity investments at that time  our share of this loss was million and was recorded as a component of equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliates on our statement of consolidated operations 
as a consolidated subsidiary  bef continues to review its operations on quarterly basis due to the challenging and uncertain business environment in which it operates 
in order to complete the gulfterra merger  the ftc required us to sell our interest in a mississippi propane storage facility in which we owned a interest 
as a result of our determination of this long lived asset s current market value  we recorded a million non cash asset impairment charge during the third quarter of  which is reflected as a component of operating costs and expenses on our statement of consolidated operations 
additionally  during we recorded a million asset impairment charge related to our petal ngl fractionator 
this non cash amount is a component of operating costs and expenses as shown on our statement of consolidated operations 
the petal ngl fractionation facility was decommissioned in december after management decided that this older facility did not fit into our long range plans due to poor economics of continued operations at the site 
we continue to own this facility  the carrying value of which has been adjusted to its fair value of approximately million 
amortization methods and estimated useful lives of qualifying intangible assets the specific  identifiable intangible assets of a business enterprise depend largely upon the nature of its operations 
potential intangible assets include intellectual property  such as technology  patents  trademarks and trade names  customer contracts and relationships  and non compete agreements  as well as other intangible assets 
the approach to the valuation of each intangible asset will vary depending upon the nature of the asset  the business in which it is utilized  and the economic returns it is generating or is expected to generate 
our recorded intangible assets primarily include the estimated value assigned to certain customer relationships and contract based assets 
our customer relationship intangible assets represent the customer base that gulfterra and the south texas midstream assets serve through providing services  including natural gas gathering and processing  ngl fractionation and pipeline transportation 
these entities conduct the majority of their business through the use of written contracts  thus  the customer relationships represent the rights we own arising from these contractual agreements 
the value of these customer relationships are being amortized using expected production curves associated with the underlying resource bases ie  the oil and gas reserves associated with the intangible assets 
our estimate of the economic life of each resource base is based on a number of factors  including third party reserve estimates  the economic viability of production and exploration activities and other industry factors 
our contract based intangible assets represent the rights we own arising from contractual agreements in the natural gas and ngl storage operations 
a contract based intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized over its estimated useful life  which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of an entity based on the respective contract terms 
our estimate of useful life is also based on a number of factors  including the expected use of the asset by the entity  the expected useful life of the related assets ie  fractionation facility  pipeline  etc  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions  including renewal or extension periods that would cause substantial costs or modifications to existing agreements  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors and the level of maintenance required to obtain the expected future cash flows 

table of contents if our underlying assumptions regarding the useful life or the economic life of the resource base associated with an intangible asset change either favorably or unfavorably  then we may be required to adjust the amortization period of such asset to reflect any new estimate of its useful life or economic life of the resource base 
such a change would increase or decrease the annual amortization charge associated with the asset at that time 
additionally  if we determine that an intangible asset s unamortized cost may not be recoverable due to impairment  we may be required to reduce the carrying value and the subsequent useful life of the asset or economic life of the resource base associated with the asset 
any such write down of the value and unfavorable change in the useful life or economic life associated with the resource base ie  amortization period of an intangible asset would increase operating costs and expenses at that time 
at december  and  the carrying value of our intangible asset portfolio was million and million 
we recorded million and million in amortization expense associated with our intangible assets during and  respectively 
a significant portion of the year to year increase in amortization expense for and is attributable to the intangible assets we acquired in the gulfterra merger  which were recorded at their preliminary fair values upon completion of the gulfterra merger at september  for additional information regarding our intangible assets  please read notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
methods we employ to measure the fair value of goodwill our goodwill is attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and is primarily comprised of million associated with the gulfterra merger which occurred on september   and million associated with the purchase of propylene fractionation assets from diamond koch in february goodwill is not amortized 
instead  goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level annually  and more frequently  if circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is below its carrying amount 
the testing of goodwill involves calculating the fair value of a reporting unit  which in turn is based on our assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit including related goodwill is less than its book value  a charge to earnings would be required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value 
if our underlying assumptions regarding the future economic prospects of a reporting unit change  this could further impact the fair value of the reporting unit and result in an additional charge to earnings to reduce the carrying value of goodwill 
at december  and  the carrying value of our goodwill was million and million 
as a result of the gulfterra merger  the preliminary value allocated to goodwill is subject to change 
for additional information regarding our goodwill  please read notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
our revenue recognition policies and use of estimates for revenues and expenses in general  we recognize revenue from our customers when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the buyer s price is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
when the contracts settle ie  either physical delivery of product has taken place or the services designated in the contract have been performed  a determination of the necessity of an allowance is made and recorded accordingly 
historically  the consolidated revenues we recorded were not materially based on estimates 
however  our use of estimates for revenues  as well as our use of estimates for operating costs and other expenses has increased as a result of sec regulations which require us to submit financial information on increasingly accelerated time frames 
such estimates are necessary due to the timing of compiling actual billing information and receiving third party data needed to record transactions for financial reporting purposes 
one example of such use of estimates is the accrual of an estimate of revenue and the cost of natural gas for a given month prior to receiving actual customer and vendor related information for the subject period 
this accrual reverses in the following month and is offset by the corresponding actual customer billing and vendor invoiced amounts 
accordingly  there is one month of estimated data in our results of operations 
such estimates are generally based on actual volume and price data through the first part of the month and then extrapolated to the end of the month  adjusted accordingly for any known or expected changes in volumes or rates through the end of the 
table of contents month 
if the basis of our estimates proves incorrect  it could result in material adjustments in results of operations between periods 
reserves for environmental matters each of our business segments is subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control 
these laws and regulations are applicable to each segment and require us to remove or remedy the effect on the environment of the disposal or release of specified substances at current and former operating sites 
we currently have a reserve for environmental matters related to remediation costs expected to be incurred over time associated with mercury meters 
we assumed this liability in connection with the gulfterra merger 
new environmental developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and new claims for damages to property  employees  other persons and the environment resulting from current or past operations  could result in substantial cost and future liabilities 
we accrue reserves for environmental matters when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
our assessments are based on studies  as well as site surveys  to determine the extent of any environmental damage and the necessary requirements to remediate this damage 
our actual results may differ from our estimates  and our estimates can be  and often are  revised in the future  either negatively or positively  depending upon the outcome or expectations based on the facts surrounding each exposure 
at december   we had a liability for environmental remediation of million  which was derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon studies and site surveys 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies and fasb interpretation no 
 reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss  we recorded our best estimate of the loss 
natural gas imbalances natural gas imbalances result when a customer delivers more or less gas into our pipelines than they take out 
we generally value our imbalances using a twelve month moving average of natural gas prices  which we believe is an appropriate assumption to estimate the value of the imbalances at the time of settlement given that the actual settlement dates are generally not known 
changes in natural gas prices may impact our estimates 
prior to the gulfterra merger  natural gas imbalances were not significant 
at december   our imbalance receivables were million and are reflected as a component of accounts receivable 
at december   our imbalance payables were million and are reflected as a component of accrued gas payables

relationship with shell we have a significant commercial relationship with shell as a partner  customer and vendor 
at march   shell owned approximately of our common units 
shell is one of our largest customers 
for the years ended december   and  shell accounted for  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues 
our revenues from shell primarily reflect the sale of ngl and petrochemical products to shell and the fees we charge shell for natural gas processing  pipeline transportation and ngl fractionation services 
our operating costs and expenses with shell primarily reflect the payment of energy related expenses related to the shell natural gas processing agreement and the purchase of ngl products from shell 
we also lease from shell its interest in one of our propylene fractionation facilities located in mont belvieu 
during  our related party revenues from shell were million and our related party expenses with shell were million 
the most significant contract affecting our natural gas processing business is the shell margin band keepwhole processing agreement  which grants us the right to process shell s current and future production within state and federal waters of the gulf of mexico 
we have also completed a number of business acquisitions and asset purchases involving shell since for additional information regarding our relationship with shell  please read item of this annual report 
relationships with unconsolidated affiliates our investment in unconsolidated affiliates with industry partners is a vital component of our business strategy 
these investments are a means by which we conduct our operations to align our interests with a supplier of raw materials or a consumer of finished products 
this method of operation also enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed versus what we could accomplish on a stand alone basis 
many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other business operations 
during  related party revenues from our unconsolidated affiliates were million and related party expenses with the unconsolidated affiliates were million 
on occasion  we enter into management agreements with some of our unconsolidated affiliates under which our unconsolidated affiliates pay us management fees for the operation and management of their assets 
however  these fees are not material to our consolidated results of operations 
additionally  on occasion we pay for construction costs on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates during the initial construction phase of their assets  and these amounts are settled by direct reimbursements for the amounts we are owed from our unconsolidated affiliates

cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
as shown on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended december   the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles represents the combined impact of changing the method our bef subsidiary uses to account for its planned major maintenance activities from the accrue in advance method to the expense as incurred method and changing the method in which we account for our investment in vesco from the cost method to the equity method 
our bef subsidiary owns an octane additive production facility that undergoes periodic planned outages of to days for major maintenance work 
these planned shutdowns typically result in significant expenditures  which are principally comprised of amounts paid to third parties for materials  contract services  and other related items 
bef used the accrue in advance method to record cost estimates for such activities  whereas  the company s other operations used the expense as incurred method for their planned major maintenance activities 
our bef subsidiary changed its accounting method on january  to conform to the company s accounting for planned major maintenance costs  which better reflects expenses in the period incurred 
as such  we believe the change is to a method that is preferable in the circumstances 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change for years prior to resulted in a benefit of million

table of contents risk factors an investment in our common units involves risks 
if any of these risks were to occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common units could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
among the key risk factors that may have a direct impact on our results of operations and financial condition are risks related to our business changes in the prices of hydrocarbon products may materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we operate predominantly in the midstream energy sector which includes gathering  transporting  processing  fractionating and storing natural gas  ngls and crude oil 
as such  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by changes in the prices of these hydrocarbon products and by changes in the relative price levels among these hydrocarbon products 
in general terms  the prices of natural gas  ngls  crude oil and other hydrocarbon products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are impossible to control 
these factors include the level of domestic production  the availability of imported oil and natural gas  actions taken by foreign oil and natural gas producing nations  the availability of transportation systems with adequate capacity  the availability of competitive fuels  fluctuating and seasonal demand for oil  natural gas and ngls  and conservation and the extent of governmental regulation of production and the overall economic environment 
we are also exposed to natural gas and ngl commodity price risk under natural gas processing and gathering and ngl fractionation contracts that provide for our fee to be calculated based on a regional natural gas or ngl price index or to be paid in kind by taking title to natural gas or ngls 
a decrease in natural gas and ngl prices can result in lower margins from these contracts  which may materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
a decline in the volume of natural gas  ngls and crude oil delivered to our facilities could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
our profitability could be materially impacted by a decline in the volume of natural gas  ngls and crude oil transported  gathered or processed at our facilities 
a material decrease in natural gas or crude oil production or crude oil refining  as a result of depressed commodity prices  a decrease in exploration and development activities or otherwise  could result in a decline in the volume of natural gas  ngls and crude oil handled by our facilities 
the crude oil  natural gas and ngls available to our facilities will be derived from reserves produced from existing wells  which reserves naturally decline over time 
to offset this natural decline  our facilities will need access to additional reserves 
additionally  some of our facilities will be dependent on reserves that are expected to be produced from newly discovered properties that are currently being developed 

table of contents exploration and development of new oil and natural gas reserves is capital intensive  particularly offshore in the gulf of mexico 
many economic and business factors are out of our control and can adversely affect the decision by producers to explore for and develop new reserves 
these factors include relatively low oil and natural gas prices  cost and availability of equipment  regulatory changes  capital budget limitations or the lack of available capital 
for example  a sustained decline in the price of natural gas and crude oil could result in a decrease in natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities in the regions where our facilities are located 
this could result in a decrease in volumes to our offshore platforms  natural gas processing plants  natural gas  crude oil and ngl pipelines  and ngl fractionators which would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 
additional reserves  if discovered  may not be developed in the near future or at all 
a reduction in demand for ngl products by the petrochemical  refining or heating industries could materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
a reduction in demand for ngl products by the petrochemical  refining or heating industries  whether because of general economic conditions  reduced demand by consumers for the end products made with ngl products  increased competition from petroleum based products due to pricing differences  adverse weather conditions  government regulations affecting prices and production levels of natural gas or the content of motor gasoline or other reasons  could materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
for example ethane 
if natural gas prices increase significantly in relation to ethane prices  it may be more profitable for natural gas producers to leave the ethane in the natural gas stream to be burned as fuel than to extract the ethane from the mixed ngl stream for sale 
propane 
the demand for propane as a heating fuel is significantly affected by weather conditions 
unusually warm winters could cause the demand for propane to decline significantly and could cause a significant decline in the volumes of propane that the combined company transports 
isobutane 
any reduction in demand for motor gasoline additives may reduce demand for isobutane 
during periods in which the difference in market prices between isobutane and normal butane is low or inventory values are high relative to current prices for normal butane or isobutane  our operating margin from selling isobutane could be reduced 
propylene 
any downturn in the domestic or international economy could cause reduced demand for propylene  which could cause a reduction in the volumes of propylene that we produce and expose our investment in inventories of propane propylene mix to pricing risk due to requirements for short term price discounts in the spot or short term propylene markets 
we face competition from third parties in our midstream businesses 
even if reserves exist in the areas accessed by our facilities and are ultimately produced  we may not be chosen by the producers in these areas to gather  transport  process  fractionate  store or otherwise handle the hydrocarbons that are produced 
we compete with others  including producers of oil and natural gas  for any such production on the basis of many factors  including geographic proximity to the production  costs of connection  available capacity  rates  and access to markets 
our debt level may limit our future financial and operating flexibility 
as of december   we had approximately billion of consolidated debt outstanding 
the amount of our debt could have significant effects on our future operations  including  among other things a significant portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and will not be available for other purposes  including the payment of distributions on our common units and capital expenditures  credit rating agencies may view our debt level negatively  
table of contents covenants contained in our existing debt arrangements will require us to continue to meet financial tests that may adversely affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general partnership purposes may be limited  we may be at a competitive disadvantage relative to similar companies that have less debt  and we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions as a result of our significant debt level 
our public debt indentures currently do not limit the amount of future indebtedness that we can create  incur  assume or guarantee 
our multi year revolving credit facility  however  restricts our ability to incur additional debt  though any debt we may incur in compliance with these restrictions may still be substantial 
our multi year revolving credit facility and indentures for our public debt contain conventional financial covenants and other restrictions 
a breach of any of these restrictions by us could permit the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under those debt agreements to be immediately due and payable and  in the case of the credit facilities  to terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
our ability to access capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms will be affected by our debt level  the amount of our debt maturing in the next several years and current maturities  and by adverse market conditions resulting from  among other things  general economic conditions  contingencies and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and impossible to control 
moreover  if the rating agencies were to downgrade our partnership s credit rating  then we could experience an increase in our borrowing costs  difficulty assessing capital markets or a reduction in the market price of our common units 
such a development could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions or to refinance existing indebtedness 
if we are unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms in the future  we might be forced to seek extensions for some of our short term securities or to refinance some of our debt obligations through bank credit  as opposed to long term public debt securities or equity securities 
the price and terms upon which we might receive such extensions or additional bank credit  if at all  could be more onerous than those contained in existing debt agreements 
any such arrangements could  in turn  increase the risk that our leverage may adversely affect our future financial and operating flexibility and thereby impact our ability to pay cash distributions at expected rates 
we may not be able to fully execute our growth strategy if we encounter illiquid capital markets or increased competition for qualified assets 
our strategy contemplates growth through the development and acquisition of a wide range of midstream and other energy infrastructure assets while maintaining a strong balance sheet 
this strategy includes constructing and acquiring additional assets and businesses to enhance our ability to compete effectively and diversify our asset portfolio  thereby providing more stable cash flow 
we regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding  and are currently contemplating  potential joint ventures  stand alone projects or other transactions that we believe will present opportunities to realize synergies  expand our role in the energy infrastructure business and increase our market position 
we may require substantial new capital to finance the future development and acquisition of assets and businesses 
limitations on our access to capital will impair our ability to execute this strategy 
expensive capital will limit our ability to develop or acquire accretive assets 
we may not be able to raise the necessary funds on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  we are experiencing increased competition for the assets we purchase or contemplate purchasing 
increased competition for a limited pool of assets could result in our losing to other bidders more often or acquiring assets at higher prices 
either occurrence would limit our ability to fully execute our growth strategy 
our inability to execute our growth strategy may materially adversely impact the market price of our securities 

table of contents our growth strategy may adversely affect our results of operations if we do not successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire or if we substantially increase our indebtedness and contingent liabilities to make acquisitions 
our growth strategy includes making accretive acquisitions 
as a result  from time to time  we will evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing operations 
similar to the risks associated with integrating our operations with gulfterra s operations  we may be unable to integrate successfully businesses we acquire in the future 
we may incur substantial expenses or encounter delays or other problems in connection with our growth strategy that could negatively impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
moreover  acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  services and products of the acquired companies or business segments  establishing the internal controls and procedures that we are required to maintain under the sarbanes oxley act of  managing relationships with new joint venture partners with whom we have not previously partnered  inefficiencies and complexities that can arise because of unfamiliarity with new assets and the businesses associated with them  including with their markets  and diversion of the attention of management and other personnel from day to day business to the development or acquisition of new businesses and other business opportunities 
if consummated  any acquisition or investment would also likely result in the incurrence of indebtedness and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expense and depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses 
as a result  our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly following an acquisition 
a substantial increase in our indebtedness and contingent liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operating cash flows from our capital projects may not be immediate 
we are engaged in several construction projects involving existing and new facilities for which significant capital has been expended  and our operating cash flow from a particular project may not increase immediately following its completion 
for instance  if we build a new pipeline or platform or expand an existing facility  the design  construction  development and installation may occur over an extended period of time  and we may not receive any material increase in operating cash flow from that project until after it is placed in service 
if we experience unanticipated or extended delays in generating operating cash flow from these projects  we may be required to reduce or reprioritize our capital budget  sell non core assets  access the capital markets or decrease distributions to unitholders in order to meet our capital requirements 
our actual construction  development and acquisition costs could exceed forecasted amounts 
we will have significant expenditures for the development  construction or other acquisition of energy infrastructure assets  including some construction and development projects with significant technological challenges 
for example  underwater operations  especially those in water depths in excess of feet  are very expensive and involve much more uncertainty and risk  and if a problem occurs  the solution  if one exists  may be very expensive and time consuming 
we may not be able to complete our projects  whether in deepwater or otherwise  at the costs estimated at the time of initiation 
we may be unable to cause our joint ventures to take or not to take certain actions unless some or all of our joint venture participants agree 
we participate in several joint ventures 
due to the nature of some of these joint ventures  each participant in each of these joint ventures has made substantial investments in the joint venture and  accordingly  has required 
table of contents that the relevant organizational documents contain certain features designed to provide each participant with the opportunity to participate in the management of the joint venture and to protect its investment in that joint venture  as well as any other assets which may be substantially dependent on or otherwise affected by the activities of that joint venture 
these participation and protective features include a corporate governance structure that requires at least a majority in interest vote to authorize many basic activities and requires a greater voting interest sometimes up to to authorize more significant activities 
examples of these more significant activities are large expenditures or contractual commitments  the construction or acquisition of assets  borrowing money or otherwise raising capital  transactions with affiliates of a joint venture participant  litigation and transactions not in the ordinary course of business  among others 
thus  without the concurrence of joint venture participants with enough voting interests  we may be unable to cause any of our joint ventures to take or not to take certain actions  even though those actions may be in the best interest of us or the particular joint venture 
moreover  any joint venture owner may sell  transfer or otherwise modify its ownership interest in a joint venture  whether in a transaction involving third parties or the other joint venture owners 
any such transaction could result in our partnering with different or additional parties 
the interruption of distributions to us from our subsidiaries and joint ventures may affect our ability to satisfy our obligations and to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
we are a holding company with no business operations 
our only significant assets are the equity interests we own in our subsidiaries and joint ventures 
as a result  we depend upon the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries and joint ventures and the distribution of that cash to us in order to meet our obligations and to allow us to make distributions to our unitholders 
in addition  our joint venture charter documents typically vest in its management committee s sole discretion regarding the occurrence and amount of distributions 
some of the joint ventures in which we participate have several credit agreements that contain various restrictive covenants 
among other things  those covenants may limit or restrict the joint venture s ability to make distributions to us under certain circumstances 
accordingly  our joint ventures may be unable to make distributions to us at current levels or at all 
a natural disaster  catastrophe or other event could result in severe personal injury  property damage and environmental damage  which could curtail our operations and otherwise materially adversely affect our cash flow 
some of our operations involve risks of personal injury  property damage and environmental damage  which could curtail our operations and otherwise materially adversely affect our cash flow 
for example  natural gas facilities operate at high pressures  sometimes in excess of  pounds per square inch 
we also operate oil and natural gas facilities located underwater in the gulf of mexico  which can involve complexities  such as extreme water pressure 
virtually all of our operations are exposed to potential natural disasters  including hurricanes  tornadoes  storms  floods and or earthquakes 
if one or more facilities that are owned by us or that deliver oil  natural gas or other products to us are damaged by severe weather or any other disaster  accident  catastrophe or event  our operations could be significantly interrupted 
similar interruptions could result from damage to production or other facilities that supply our facilities or other stoppages arising from factors beyond our control 
these interruptions might involve significant damage to people  property or the environment  and repairs might take from a week or less for a minor incident to six months or more for a major interruption 
additionally  some of the storage contracts that we are a party to obligate us to indemnify our customers for any damage or injury occurring during the period in which the customers natural gas is in our possession 
any event that interrupts the fees generated by our energy infrastructure assets  or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance  could reduce our cash available from operating activities and  accordingly  adversely affect the market price of our securities 
we believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage  although insurance will not cover many types of interruptions that might occur 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially  and in some instances  certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
as a result  we may not be able to renew our existing insurance policies or 
table of contents procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur 
an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets could reduce our earnings 
at december  our balance sheet reflected million of goodwill and million of intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets 
gaap requires us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
long lived assets such as intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if we determine that any of our goodwill or intangible assets were impaired  we would be required to take an immediate charge to earnings with a correlative effect on partners equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization 
increases in interest rates could adversely affect our business 
in addition to our exposure to commodity prices  we have significant exposure to increases in interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately billion of consolidated debt  of which approximately billion was at fixed interest rates and approximately billion was at variable interest rates  after giving effect to existing interest swap arrangements 
from time to time  we may enter into additional interest rate swap arrangements  which could increase our exposure to variable interest rates 
as a result  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition  could be materially adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates 
an increase in interest rates may also cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity investments in general  and in particular for yield based equity investments such as our common units 
any such reduction in demand for our common units resulting from other more attractive investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our common units to decline 
the use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses by us 
we historically have sought to limit a portion of the adverse effects resulting from changes in oil and natural gas commodity prices and interest rates by using financial derivative instruments and other hedging mechanisms from time to time 
to the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures  we will forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor 
in addition  even though monitored by management  hedging activities can result in losses 
such losses could occur under various circumstances  including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the hedge arrangement  the hedge is imperfect  or hedging policies and procedures are not followed 
our pipeline integrity program may impose significant costs and liabilities on us 
in december  the us department of transportation issued a final rule effective as of february  requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate their pipelines  and take measures to protect pipeline segments located in what the rule refers to as high consequence areas 
the final rule resulted from the enactment of the pipeline safety improvement act of at this time  we cannot predict the outcome of this rule on us 
however  we will continue our pipeline integrity testing programs  which are intended to assess and maintain the integrity of our pipelines 
the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines 

table of contents environmental costs and liabilities and changing environmental regulation could materially affect our cash flow 
our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental affairs  health and safety  waste management and chemical and petroleum products 
governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations and permits and to subject violators to civil and criminal penalties  including substantial fines  injunctions or both 
third parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance 
we will make expenditures in connection with environmental matters as part of normal capital expenditure programs 
however  future environmental law developments  such as stricter laws  regulations  permits or enforcement policies  could significantly increase some costs of our operations  including the handling  manufacture  use  emission or disposal of substances and wastes 
moreover  as with other companies engaged in similar or related businesses  our operations have some risk of environmental costs and liabilities because we handle petroleum products 
federal  state or local regulatory measures could materially adversely affect our business 
the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc  regulates our interstate natural gas pipelines and interstate ngl and petrochemical pipelines and interstate natural gas storage facilities  while state regulatory agencies regulate our intrastate natural gas and ngl pipelines  intrastate storage facilities and gathering lines 
this federal and state regulation extends to such matters as rate structures  rates of return on equity  recovery of costs  the services that our regulated assets are permitted to perform  the acquisition  construction and disposition of assets  and to an extent  the level of competition in that regulated industry for a general overview of ferc and state regulation applicable to our energy infrastructure assets  please read business and properties regulation and environmental matters  included under items and of this annual report 
this regulatory oversight can affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our products and could materially adversely affect our cash flow 
under the natural gas act  ferc has authority to regulate our natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce 
its authority to regulate those services includes the rates charged for the services  terms and conditions of service  certification and construction of new facilities  the acquisition  extension  disposition or abandonment of facilities  the maintenance of accounts and records the initiation  extension and discontinuation of services  and various other matters 
ferc requires that our services are provided on a non discriminatory basis so that all shippers have open access to our pipelines and storage 
pursuant to ferc s jurisdiction over interstate gas pipeline rates  existing pipeline rates may be challenged by customer complaint or by the ferc staff and proposed rate increases may be challenged by protest 
for example  in december  high island offshore system hios  an interstate natural gas pipeline owned by us  filed a rate case pursuant to section of the natural gas act before ferc to increase its transportation fees 
ferc accepted hios tariff sheets implementing the new rates  subject to refund  and set certain issues for hearing before an administrative law judge alj the alj issued an initial decision on the issues set for hearing on april   proposing rates lower than the rate initially proposed by hios 
in response to the alj s initial decision  hios filed  on august   a settlement agreement whereby hios proposed to implement its rates in effect prior to this proceeding for a prospective three year period 

table of contents on january   ferc issued an order rejecting hios settlement offer and generally affirming the alj s initial decision  resulting in rates significantly lower than the rate proposed in hios settlement offer 
on february   we filed a request for rehearing with the ferc 
ferc s january order may be subject to other requests for rehearing and appeal to federal court 
we are not able to predict the outcome of the hios proceeding  but an adverse outcome in this proceeding or any other rate case proceedings to which we may be a party in the future could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
ferc also has authority under the interstate commerce act  or ica  to regulate the rates  terms  and conditions applied to our interstate pipelines engaged in the transportation of ngls and petrochemicals commonly known as oil pipelines 
pursuant to the ica  oil pipeline rates can be challenged at ferc either by protest  when they are initially filed or increased  or by complaint at any time they remain on file with the jurisdictional agency 
we have interests in natural gas pipeline facilities offshore from texas and louisiana 
these facilities are subject to regulation by ferc and other federal agencies  including the department of interior  under the outer continental shelf lands act  and by the department of transportation s office of pipeline safety under the natural gas pipeline safety act 
our intrastate ngl and natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation in alabama  colorado  louisiana  mississippi  new mexico and texas and our intrastate natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc pursuant to section of the natural gas policy act  or ngpa 
we also have natural gas underground storage facilities in louisiana  mississippi and texas 
although state regulation is typically less onerous than at ferc  proposed and existing rates subject to state regulation and the provision of services on a non discriminatory basis are also subject to challenge by protest and complaint  respectively 
on july   the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued its opinion in bp west coast products  llc v 
ferc  addressing the rate of sfpp  a publicly traded limited partnership 
the court a upheld ferc s determination that some of sfpp s rates were grandfathered rates under the energy policy act and that sfpp s shippers had not demonstrated substantially changed circumstances that would justify modification of those rates  remanded the issue b eliminated the tax allowance in sfpp s rates because the sfpp limited partnership did not have tax liability and c remanded the issue of whether sfpp s revised cost of service without the tax allowance would qualify as a substantially changed circumstance that would justify modification of sfpp s rates 
because the court remanded the case to the ferc and because the ferc s ruling on the substantially changed circumstances issue will focus on the facts and record presented to it  it is not clear what impact  if any  the opinion will have on our rates or on the rates of other ferc jurisdictional pipelines organized as tax pass through entities 
ferc has initiated a public inquiry in docket no 
pl into the proper treatment of income tax allowances on cost of service ratemaking proceeding involving partnerships 
moreover  it is not clear whether ferc s action taken in response to bp west coast will be challenged and  if so  whether it will withstand further ferc or judicial review 
parties could challenge the rates of our common carrier interstate liquid pipelines and our interstate natural gas pipelines and argue that the rationale in the bp west coast decision  regarding tax allowances  should be applied 
while it is possible that party might challenge these rates  it is not possible to predict the likelihood that such a challenge would succeed at the ferc 
terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities could adversely affect our business 
since the september  terrorist attacks on the united states  the united states government has issued warnings that energy assets  including our nation s pipeline infrastructure  may be the future target of terrorist organizations 
any terrorist attack on our facilities or pipelines or those of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
an escalation of political tensions in the middle east and elsewhere  could result in increased volatility in the world s energy markets and result in a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents risks related to our common units as a result of our partnership structure we may issue additional securities without the approval of our common unitholders 
following the gulfterra merger and subject to nyse rules  we may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests of any type to parties other than our affiliates without the approval of our unitholders 
our partnership agreement does not give our common unitholders the right to approve its issuance of equity securities ranking equal or junior to the common units 
the issuance of additional common units or other equity securities of equal rank will have the following effects the proportionate ownership interest of a common unit will decrease  the amount of cash available for distributions on each unit may decrease  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished  and the market price of our common units may decline 
we may not have sufficient cash from operations to pay distributions at the current level following establishment of cash reserves and payments of fees and expenses  including payments to enterprise gp 
because distributions on our common units are dependent on the amount of cash we generate  distributions may fluctuate based on our performance 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay distributions at the current level each quarter 
the actual amount of cash that is available to be distributed each quarter will depend upon numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control and the control of enterprise gp 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the level of our operating costs  the level of competition in our business segments  prevailing economic conditions  the level of capital expenditures we make  the restrictions contained in our debt agreements and our debt service requirements  fluctuations in our working capital needs  the cost of acquisitions  if any  and the amount  if any  of cash reserves established by enterprise gp in its sole discretion 
in addition  you should be aware that our ability to pay the minimum quarterly distribution each quarter depends primarily on our cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  not solely on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
as a result  we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses and we may not make distributions during periods when we record net income 
we do not have the same flexibility as other types of organizations to accumulate cash and equity to protect against illiquidity in the future 
unlike a corporation  our partnership agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash reduced by any amounts of reserves for commitments and contingencies  including capital and operating costs and debt service requirements 
the value of our units and other limited partner interests may decrease in direct correlation with decreases in the amount we distribute per unit 
accordingly  if we experience a liquidity problem in the future  we may not be able to issue more equity to recapitalize 

table of contents cost reimbursements and fees due enterprise gp may be substantial and will reduce our cash available for distribution to holders of our units 
prior to making any distribution on our units  we will reimburse enterprise gp and its affiliates  including officers and directors of enterprise gp  for expenses they incur on our behalf 
the reimbursement of expenses could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to holders of our units 
enterprise gp has sole discretion to determine the amount of these expenses 
in addition  enterprise gp and its affiliates may provide other services to us for which we will be charged fees as determined by enterprise gp 
enterprise gp and its affiliates have limited fiduciary responsibilities and conflicts of interest with respect to our partnership 
the directors and officers of enterprise gp and its affiliates have duties to manage enterprise gp in a manner that is beneficial to its members 
at the same time  enterprise gp has duties to manage our partnership in a manner that is beneficial to us 
therefore  enterprise gp s duties to us may conflict with the duties of its officers and directors to its members 
such conflicts may include  among others  the following decisions of enterprise gp regarding the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales  cash expenditures  borrowings  issuances of additional units and reserves in any quarter may affect the level of cash available to pay quarterly distributions to unitholders and enterprise gp  under our partnership agreement  enterprise gp determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us  enterprise gp is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us  such as its parent company  epco  in resolving conflicts of interest  which has the effect of limiting its fiduciary duty to unitholders  affiliates of enterprise gp may compete with us in certain circumstances  enterprise gp may limit our liability and reduce our fiduciary duties  while also restricting the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that might  without the limitations  constitute breaches of fiduciary duty 
as a result of purchasing our units  you are deemed to consent to some actions and conflicts of interest that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable law  and we do not have any employees and we rely solely on employees of epco and its affiliates 
even if unitholders are dissatisfied  they cannot easily remove enterprise gp 
unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation  unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and  therefore  limited ability to influence management s decisions regarding our business 
unitholders did not elect enterprise gp or its directors and will have no right to elect our general partner or its directors on an annual or other continuing basis 
furthermore  if unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner  they will have little ability to remove enterprise gp 
enterprise gp may not be removed except upon the vote of the holders of at least of our outstanding units voting together as a single class 
because affiliates of enterprise gp currently own approximately of our outstanding common units  the removal of enterprise gp as our general partner is not possible without the consent of both enterprise gp and such owner affiliates 
unitholders voting rights are further restricted by a provision in our partnership agreement stating that any units held by a person that owns or more of any class of our units then outstanding  other than our general partner and its affiliates  cannot be voted on any matter 
in addition  our partnership agreement contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations  as well as other provisions limiting our unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of our management 

table of contents as a result of these provisions  the trading price of our common units may be lower than other forms of equity ownership because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price 
enterprise gp has a limited call right that may require common unitholders to sell their units at an undesirable time or price 
if at any time enterprise gp and its affiliates own or more of the common units then outstanding  enterprise gp will have the right  but not the obligation  which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the remaining common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then current market price 
as a result  common unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may therefore not receive any return on their investment 
they may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units 
under our partnership agreement  shell is not deemed to be an affiliate of enterprise gp for purposes of this limited call right 
our common unitholders may not have limited liability if a court finds that limited partner actions constitute control of our business 
under delaware law  common unitholders could be held liable for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner if a court determined that the right of limited partners to remove our general partner or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the control of our business 
under delaware law  our general partner generally has unlimited liability for our obligations  such as our debts and environmental liabilities  except for those of our contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner 
in addition  section of the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act provides that  under some circumstances  a limited partner may be liable to us for the amount of a distribution for a period of three years from the date of the distribution 
a large number of our outstanding common units may be sold in the market  which may depress the market price of our common units 
sales of a substantial number of our common units in the public market could cause the market price of our common units to decline 
as of march   a total of approximately  million of our common units were outstanding 
shell owns  of our common units  representing approximately of our outstanding common units at march   and has publicly announced its intention to reduce its holdings of our common units on an orderly schedule over a period of years  taking into account market conditions 
under a registration rights agreement  we are obligated  subject to certain limitations and conditions  to register the common units held by shell for resale 
sales of a substantial number of these common units in the trading markets  whether in a single transaction or series of transactions  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could reduce the market price of our outstanding common units 
in addition  these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could make it more difficult for us to sell our common units in the future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
we may use financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to mitigate the risks of certain identifiable and anticipated transactions 
in general  the type of risks we attempt to hedge are those related to the variability of future earnings  fair values of certain debt instruments and cash flows resulting from changes in applicable interest rates or commodity prices 
as a matter of policy  we do not use financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we recognize financial instruments as assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets based on fair value 
fair value is generally defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  not in a forced or liquidation sale 
the estimated fair values of our financial instruments have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques 
we must use considerable judgment  however  in interpreting market data and developing these estimates 
accordingly  our fair value estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize upon disposition of these instruments 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation techniques could have a material effect on our estimates of fair value 
changes in the fair value of financial instrument contracts are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if the financial instruments meet those criteria  the instrument s gains and losses offset the related results of the hedged item in earnings for a fair value hedge and are deferred in other comprehensive income for a cash flow hedge 
gains and losses related to a cash flow hedge are reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
to qualify as a hedge  the item to be hedged must be exposed to commodity or interest rate risk and the hedging instrument must reduce the exposure and meet the hedging requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted 
we must formally designate the financial instrument as a hedge and document and assess the effectiveness of the hedge at inception and on a quarterly basis 
any ineffectiveness of the hedge is recorded in current earnings 
due to the complexity of sfas no 
as amended and interpreted  the fasb is continuing to provide guidance regarding the implementation of this accounting standard 
since this guidance is still continuing  our conclusions about the application of sfas no 
may be altered  which may result in adjustments being recorded in future periods as we adopt new fasb interpretations of this standard 
interest rate risk hedging program our interest rate exposure results from variable and fixed rate borrowings under debt agreements 
we assess the cash flow risk related to interest rates by identifying and measuring changes in our interest rate exposures that may impact future cash flows and evaluating hedging opportunities to manage these risks 
we use analytical techniques to measure our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  including cash flow sensitivity analysis models to forecast the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows 
enterprise gp oversees the strategies associated with these financial risks and approves instruments that are appropriate for our requirements 
we manage a portion of our interest rate exposures by utilizing interest rate swaps and similar arrangements  which allow us to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt or a portion of variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
we believe that it is prudent to maintain an appropriate balance of variable rate and fixed rate debt in the current business climate 
fair value hedges interest rate swaps 
in january  we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million in which we exchanged the payment of fixed rate interest on a portion of principal outstanding under senior notes b and c for variable rate interest 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into six additional interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million related to a portion of the principal outstanding under senior notes g issued on october

to million the variable rate indicated is the all in variable rate for the current settlement period 
we have designated these nine interest rate swaps as fair value hedges under sfas no 
since they mitigate changes in the fair value of the underlying fixed rate debt 
as effective fair value hedges  an increase in the fair value of these interest rate swaps is equally offset by an increase in fair value of the underlying hedged debt 
the offsetting changes in fair value have no effect on current period interest expense 
these nine agreements have a combined notional amount of million and match the maturity dates of the underlying debt being hedged 
under each swap agreement  we pay the counterparty a variable interest rate based on six month libor rates plus an applicable margin as defined in each swap agreement and receive back from the counterparty a fixed interest rate payment based on the stated interest rate of the debt being hedged  with both payments calculated using the notional amounts stated in each swap agreement 
we settle amounts receivable from or payable to the counterparties every six months the settlement period 
the settlement amount is amortized ratably to earnings as either an increase or a decrease in interest expense over the settlement period 
total fair value of the interest rate swaps in effect at december  was a receivable of approximately million with an offsetting increase in fair value of the underlying debt 
interest expense in our statements of consolidated operations and comprehensive income for the year ended december  reflects a million benefit from these swap agreements 
the following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value fv of our interest rate swap portfolio and the related change in fair value of the underlying debt at the dates indicated dollars in thousands resulting swap fv inc dec in scenario classification at fv of debt fv assuming no change in underlying interest rates asset liability fv assuming increase in underlying interest rates asset liability   fv assuming decrease in underlying interest rates asset liability   resulting swap fv inc dec in scenario classification at fv of debt fv assuming no change in underlying interest rates asset liability   fv assuming increase in underlying interest rates asset liability   fv assuming decrease in underlying interest rates asset liability   the fair value of the interest rate swaps excludes the benefit we have already recorded in earnings 
the change in fair value between december  and march  is primarily due to an increase in market interest rates relative to the forward interest rate curve used to determine the fair value of our financial instruments 
the underlying floating libor forward interest rate curve used to determine the march  fair values ranged from approximately to using month reset periods ranging from october to october cash flow hedges forward starting interest rate swaps 
during the first nine months of  we entered into eight forward starting interest rate swap transactions having an aggregate notional amount of billion in anticipation of our financing activities associated with closing the gulfterra merger 
our purpose in entering into these transactions was to effectively hedge the underlying us treasury rate related to our anticipated issuance of billion in principal amount of fixed rate debt 
on october   our operating partnership issued billion of private debt securities under senior notes e  f  g and h 
each of the forward starting swaps was designated as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 

table of contents in april  we elected to terminate the initial four forward starting swaps in order to manage and maximize the value of the swaps and to reduce future debt service costs 
as a result  we received million in cash from the counterparties 
in september  we settled the remaining four swaps resulting in an million payment to the counterparties 
the net gain of million from these settlements will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to reduce interest expense over the life of the associated debt 
the following table shows the notional amount covered by each forward starting swap and the cash gain loss associated with each swap upon settlement dollars in thousands notional net cash amount of received upon debt covered by settlement of term of anticipated debt offering forward forward or forecasted transaction starting swaps starting swaps year  fixed rate debt instrument year  fixed rate debt instrument year  fixed rate debt instrument year  fixed rate debt instrument total commodity risk hedging program the prices of natural gas  ngls and petrochemical products are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
in order to manage the risks associated with natural gas and ngls  we may enter into commodity financial instruments 
the primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to price risks associated with i natural gas purchases  ii ngl production and inventories  iii related firm commitments  iv fluctuations in transportation revenues where the underlying fees are based on natural gas index prices and v certain anticipated transactions involving either natural gas or ngls 
the commodity financial instruments we utilize may be settled in cash or with another financial instrument 
historically  we have not hedged our exposure to risks associated with petrochemical products  including mtbe 
we have adopted a policy to govern our use of commodity financial instruments to manage the risks of our natural gas and ngl businesses 
the objective of this policy is to assist us in achieving our profitability goals while maintaining a portfolio with an acceptable level of risk  defined as remaining within the position limits established by enterprise gp 
we may enter into risk management transactions to manage price risk  basis risk  physical risk or other risks related to our commodity positions on both a short term less than days and long term basis  not to exceed months 
enterprise gp oversees the strategies associated with physical and financial risks such as those mentioned previously  approves specific activities subject to the policy including authorized products  instruments and markets and establishes specific guidelines and procedures for implementing and ensuring compliance with the policy 
we assess the risk of our commodity financial instrument portfolio using a sensitivity analysis model 
the sensitivity analysis performed on this portfolio measures the potential income or loss eg  the change in fair value of the portfolio based upon a hypothetical movement in the underlying quoted market prices of the commodity financial instruments outstanding at the dates noted within the following table 
in general  the quoted market prices used in the model are from those actively quoted on commodity exchanges ie  nymex for instruments of similar duration 
in those rare instances where prices are not actively quoted  we calculate forward price curves based on similar products which are actively quoted using regression equations with strong correlation factors 
the sensitivity analysis model takes into account the following primary factors and assumptions the current quoted market price of natural gas  the current quoted market price of ngls  
table of contents changes in the composition of commodities hedged ie  the mix between natural gas and related ngls  fluctuations in the overall volume of commodities hedged for both natural gas and related ngl hedges outstanding  market interest rates  which are used in determining the present value  and a liquid market for such financial instruments 
an increase in fair value of the commodity financial instruments based upon the factors and assumptions noted above approximates the income that would be recognized if all of the commodity financial instruments were settled at the dates noted within the table 
conversely  a decrease in fair value of the commodity financial instruments would result in the recording of a loss 
the sensitivity analysis model does not include the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the hedged commodity positions to which they relate 
therefore  the impact on the fair value of the commodity financial instruments of a change in commodity prices would be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged commodity positions  assuming the commodity financial instruments function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk  the commodity financial instruments are not closed out in advance of their expected term  and as applicable  anticipated underlying transactions settle as expected 
we routinely review our outstanding financial instruments in light of current market conditions 
if market conditions warrant  some financial instruments may be closed out in advance of their contractual settlement dates thus realizing income or loss depending on the specific exposure 
when this occurs  we may enter into a new commodity financial instrument to reestablish the economic hedge to which the closed instrument relates 
we had a limited number of commodity financial instruments in our portfolio at december  the following tables show the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value fv of this portfolio at the dates indicated dollars in thousands resulting fv fv fv scenario classification at at at fv assuming no change in underlying commodity prices asset liability fv assuming increase in underlying commodity prices asset liability fv assuming decrease in underlying commodity prices asset liability at december   our portfolio primarily consisted of a limited number of natural gas cash flow and fair value hedges 
we recorded million of income related to our commodity hedging activities during and an expense of million during that are included in our operating costs and expenses in the statements of consolidated operations and comprehensive income 
during  we recognized a loss of million from our commodity hedging activities that was recorded as an increase in our operating costs and expenses 
beginning in late and extending through march  a large number of our commodity hedging transactions were based on the historical relationship between natural gas and ngl prices 
this type of hedging strategy utilized the forward sale of natural gas at a fixed price with the expected margin on the settlement of the position offsetting or mitigating changes in the anticipated margins on ngl marketing activities and the market values of our equity ngl production 
throughout  this strategy proved very successful as the price of natural gas declined relative to our fixed positions and was responsible for most of the million in commodity hedging income we recorded during 
table of contents in late march  the effectiveness of this strategy was reduced due to an unexpected rapid increase in natural gas prices whereby the loss in the value of our fixed price natural gas financial instruments was not offset by increased natural gas processing margins 
due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding natural gas prices at the time  we decided that it was prudent to exit this strategy  and we did so by late april the increased ineffectiveness of this strategy is the primary reason for the million in commodity hedging losses recorded during product purchase commitments 
we have long and short term purchase commitments for ngls  petrochemicals and natural gas with several suppliers 
the purchase prices that we are obligated to pay under these contracts are based on market prices at the time we take delivery of the volumes 
for additional information regarding these commitments  please read management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our contractual obligations included under item of this annual report

in addition  in the first quarter of  we will record an approximate million gain into income from accumulated other comprehensive income related to a commodity cash flow hedge acquired in the gulfterra merger 
this gain is primarily due to an increase in fair value from that recorded for the commodity cash flow hedge at december
