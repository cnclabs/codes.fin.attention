item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k  beginning on page f overview biogen idec creates new standards of care in oncology and immunology 
as a global leader in the development  manufacturing  and commercialization of novel therapies  we transform scientific discoveries into advances in human healthcare 
we currently have five products avonex interferon beta a for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis  or ms 
rituxan rituximab and zevalin ibritumomab tiuxetan  both of which treat certain b cell non hodgkin s lymphomas  or b cell nhls 
we collaborate with genentech inc  or genentech  on the development and commercialization of rituxan 
rituxan is the trade name in the united states  or us  canada and japan for the compound rituximab 
mabthera is the tradename for rituximab in the european union  or eu 
in this form k  we refer to rituximab  rituxan and mabthera collectively as rituxan  except where we have otherwise indicated 
tysabri natalizumab  formerly known as antegren  which was approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  in november to treat relapsing forms of ms to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses 
in february  in consultation with the fda  we and elan corporation plc  or elan  voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri  and informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of tysabri until further notification 
in addition  we suspended dosing in clinical studies of tysabri in ms  crohn s disease and rheumatoid arthritis  or ra 
these decisions were based on reports of two serious adverse events that have occurred in patients treated with tysabri in combination with avonex in ms clinical studies 
these events involved two cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  or pml  a rare and frequently fatal  demyelinating disease of the central nervous system 
both patients received more than two years of tysabri in combination with avonex 
in light of the two reports of pml  the companies initiated a systematic review of the tysabri safety database 
on march   we and elan announced that the review of the safety database led a serious adverse event previously reported by a clinical investigator in a clinical study of tysabri in crohn s disease to be reassessed as pml 
the case was originally reported by the investigator as malignant astrocytoma in july the patient died in december the patient had received doses of tysabri over an month period and prior medication history included multiple courses of immunosuppressant agents 
we and elan are working with clinical investigators to evaluate patients treated with tysabri in clinical studies and are consulting with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of pml 
the outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine possible re initiation of dosing in clinical studies and future commercial availability 
see forward looking information and risk factors that may affect future results safety issues with tysabri could significantly affect our growth 
amevive alefacept for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy 
we also receive royalty revenues on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control  including on sales by schering ag of zevalin in the eu 
in addition  we have a number of ongoing research and development programs in our core therapeutic areas and in other areas of interest 
merger on november   idec pharmaceuticals corporation and biogen  inc completed a merger transaction  or the merger  resulting in biogen  inc becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of idec pharmaceuticals corporation 
the business combination was treated as an acquisition of biogen  inc by idec pharmaceuticals corporation for accounting purposes 
in connection with the merger  idec pharmaceuticals corporation changed its name to biogen idec inc 
table of contents as a result of the merger  biogen  inc stockholders received shares of biogen idec common stock for each share of biogen  inc common stock 
as a result  biogen idec issued approximately million shares of common stock at a fair value of approximately billion based on the average of the closing price of idec pharmaceuticals corporation s common stock for the period from two days before through two days after the public announcement of the merger on june  
in addition  options to purchase biogen  inc common stock outstanding at november  were assumed by biogen idec and converted into options to purchase approximately million shares of biogen idec common stock at a fair value of approximately million based on the black scholes option pricing model  as described in more detail below 
we paid approximately million in fees for banking  legal  accounting and tax related services related to the merger 
merger related fees of million paid by biogen  inc prior to completion of the merger are not included in this amount as they were expensed as incurred 
the total merger purchase price was approximately billion 
the merger qualified as a tax free reorganization within the meaning of section a of the internal revenue code 
the fair value of biogen idec s shares used in determining the purchase price was per share based on the average of the closing price of idec pharmaceuticals corporation s common stock for the period two days before through two days after public announcement of the merger on june  the fair value of stock options assumed by biogen idec in the merger was determined using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions stock price of  which is the value ascribed to idec shares in determining the purchase price  volatility of  risk free interest rate of  and an expected life of years

we expect future growth in avonex revenues to be dependent to a large extent on our ability to compete successfully 
amevive was approved in the us in for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy

in february  zevalin became the first radioimmunotherapy approved by the fda for the treatment of certain b cell nhls 
zevalin  as part of the zevalin therapeutic regimen  is approved as a treatment for relapsed or refractory low grade  follicular  or transformed b cell nhl including patients with rituxan refractory follicular nhl 
we launched zevalin in the us in april in  sales of zevalin generated revenues of million in the us as compared to million in outside the us  we have licensed our marketing rights in zevalin to schering ag 
in january  the european medicines agency  or emea  the regulatory authority in the eu  granted marketing approval of zevalin in the eu for the treatment of adult patients with cd follicular b cell nhl who are refractory to or have relapsed following treatment with rituxan 
rest of world product sales for zevalin for the year ended december  were million 
the million relates to zevalin sold to schering ag in and  recognition of which had been deferred 
the revenue was recognized in the fourth quarter of when an amendment to the license agreement was executed and the price of zevalin became determinable 
product sales from zevalin represented approximately and of our total revenues in and  respectively 
in november  tysabri was approved by the fda as treatment for relapsing forms of ms to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses 
in the us  prior to the suspension  we sold tysabri to elan who then distributed tysabri to third party distributors and other customers 
in  our revenue associated with sales of tysabri was million  which represents less than of our total revenues in in february  in consultation with the fda  we and elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri  and informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of tysabri until further notification 
the voluntary suspension will not affect revenue 
we and elan are working with clinical investigators to evaluate patients treated with tysabri in clinical studies and are consulting with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of pml 
the outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine the possibility of re initiation of dosing in clinical studies and future commercial availability

unconsolidated joint business revenue rituxan is currently marketed and sold worldwide for the treatment of certain b cell nhls 
we copromote rituxan in the us in collaboration with genentech under a collaboration agreement between the parties 
under the collaboration agreement  we granted genentech a worldwide license to develop  commercialize and market rituxan in multiple indications 
in exchange for these worldwide rights  we have copromotion rights in the us and a contractual arrangement under which genentech shares a portion of the pretax us copromotion profits of rituxan with us 
this collaboration was created through a contractual arrangement not through a joint venture or other legal entity 
in june  we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with genentech to include the development and commercialization of one or more anti cd antibodies targeting b cell disorders  in addition to rituxan  for a broad range of indications 
in the us  we contribute resources to selling and the continued development of rituxan 
genentech is responsible for worldwide manufacturing of rituxan 
genentech also is responsible for the primary support functions for the commercialization of rituxan in the us including selling and marketing  customer service  order entry  distribution  shipping and billing 
genentech also incurs the majority of 
table of contents continuing development costs for rituxan 
under the arrangement  we have a limited sales force as well as limited development activity 
under the terms of separate sublicense agreements between genentech and roche  commercialization of rituxan outside the us is the responsibility of roche  except in japan where roche copromotes rituxan in collaboration with zenyaku 
there is no direct contractual arrangement between biogen idec and roche or zenyaku 
revenue from unconsolidated joint business consists of our share of pretax copromotion profits which is calculated by genentech  and includes consideration of our rituxan related sales force and development expenses  and royalty revenue from sales of rituxan outside the us by roche and zenyaku 
copromotion profit consists of us sales of rituxan to third party customers net of discounts and allowances and less the cost to manufacture rituxan  third party royalty expenses  distribution  selling and marketing expenses  and joint development expenses incurred by genentech and us 
under the amended and restated collaboration agreement  our current pretax copromotion profit sharing formula has two tiers 
we earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met 
the profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier 
we began recording our profit share at the higher percentage during the first quarter of  and upon approval of the first new anti cd product  the pretax copromotion profit sharing formula for rituxan and other anti cd products sold by us and genentech will change over a period of time to a fixed annual profit sharing percentage at the lower tier 
copromotion profits for the years ended december   and  consist of the following table in thousands product revenues  net costs and expenses copromotion profits biogen idec s share of copromotion profits net sales of rituxan to third party customers in the us recorded by genentech for were billion compared to billion in and billion in the increase in from and was primarily due to increased market penetration in treatments of b cell nhls and chronic lymphocytic leukemia  and increases in the wholesale price of rituxan effective september  march and march we received royalties on sales of rituxan outside of the us of million in as compared to million in and million in  which we include under revenue from unconsolidated joint business in our consolidated statements of income 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business for the years ended december   and  consist of the following table in thousands copromotion profits reimbursement of selling and development expenses royalty revenue on sales of rituxan outside the us rituxan clinical data purchased from roche columbia patent royalty and interest payment 
table of contents our royalty revenue on sales of rituxan outside the us is based on roche and zenyaku s net sales to third party customers and is recorded on a cash basis 
the increase in royalty revenues in and is due to increased sales of rituxan outside the us under the amended and restated collaboration agreement  we will receive lower royalty revenue from genentech on sales by roche and zenyaku of new anti cd products and will only receive such royalty revenues for the first eleven years from the date of first commercial sale of such new anti cd products 
during  genentech purchased certain clinical data from roche that supported a potential label expansion of rituxan 
additionally  in  we  along with genentech  agreed that payments were owed to columbia university for royalties related to past sales of rituxan in the us as a result  we recognized million in royalty payments and million in interest charges related to these royalties 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business represented  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decreases in and are primarily due to former biogen  inc revenue included in our results of operations for all of and for the period of november  through december  royalty revenue we receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control 
during and  we received approximately million and million  respectively  in royalty revenues representing and of total revenues 
the increase in royalty revenue is primarily due to a full year of the former biogen  inc royalty revenue being included in our results of operations in compared to the period from november  through december  our royalty revenues on sales of rituxan outside the us are included in revenue from unconsolidated joint business 
we receive royalties from schering plough corporation  or schering plough  on sales of its alpha interferon products in the us and italy under an exclusive license to our alpha interferon patents and patent applications 
schering plough sells its intron a interferon alfa b brand of alpha interferon in the us for a number of indications  including the treatment of chronic hepatitis b and hepatitis c 
schering plough also sells other alpha interferon products for the treatment of hepatitis c  including rebetron combination therapy containing intron a and rebetol ribavirin  usp  peg intron peginterferon alfa b  a pegylated form of alpha interferon  and peg intron in combination with rebetol 
we hold several important patents related to hepatitis b antigens produced by genetic engineering techniques 
these antigens are used in recombinant hepatitis b vaccines and in diagnostic test kits used to detect hepatitis b infection 
we receive royalties from sales of hepatitis b vaccines in several countries  including the us  from glaxosmithkline plc and merck and co 
inc we have also licensed our proprietary hepatitis b rights  on an antigen by antigen and nonexclusive basis  to several diagnostic kit manufacturers  including abbott laboratories  the major worldwide marketer of hepatitis b diagnostic kits 
we also receive ongoing royalties on sales of angiomax bivalirudin by the medicines company  or tmc 
tmc sells angiomax in the us for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty 
tmc sells angiomax through distributors in europe  canada and latin america 
we anticipate that total royalty revenues in will be slightly higher as compared to our total royalty revenues in royalty revenues may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in sales levels of products sold by our licensees from quarter to quarter due to the timing and extent of major events such as new indication approvals or government sponsored programs 
corporate partner revenues corporate partner revenues consist of contract revenues and license fees 
corporate partner revenues totaled million in compared to million in and million in corporate partner 
table of contents revenues represented less than of total revenues in and and approximately of total revenues in in  we received a million payment from schering ag for the emea grant of marketing approval of zevalin in the eu 
the payment represented  in part  a milestone payment to compensate us for preparing  generating  and collecting data that was critical to the emea marketing approval process and  to which we have no continuing involvement 
the decrease in corporate partner revenues in is primarily due to decreased research and development funding in under our collaborations with taisho pharmaceutical co 
ltd 
of tokyo  or taisho  as a result of the termination of our collaboration with taisho  and under our collaborations with seikagaku corporation  or seikagaku 
contract revenues and license fees are  in part  dependent upon the achievement of certain research and development and commercialization objectives and  accordingly  may vary from year to year 
operating costs and expenses in thousands cost of product and royalty revenues research and development selling  general and administrative write off of acquired in process research and development amortization of acquired intangibles total operating costs and expenses cost of product and royalty revenues in  total cost of product and royalty revenues was million and consisted of product cost of revenues of million and cost of royalty revenues of million 
product cost of revenues consisted of million related to avonex  million related to amevive  million related to zevalin and million related to tysabri 
approximately million in cost of product revenues represents the difference between the cost of avonex and amevive inventory recorded at the merger date and its historical manufacturing cost  which was recognized as cost of product revenues when the acquired inventory was sold or written down in all avonex inventory acquired in the merger was sold or written off as of december  we expect that product cost of revenues in related to amevive will include approximately million related to the difference between the cost of amevive inventory recorded at the merger and its historical manufacturing cost  as the acquired inventory is sold or written down 
in february  we and elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri based on reports of two serious adverse events that occurred in patients treated with tysabri in combination with avonex in ms clinical studies 
these events involved two cases  of pml  a rare and frequently fatal  demyelinating disease of the central nervous system 
in light of the two reports of pml  the companies initiated a systematic review of the tysabri safety database 
on march   we and elan announced that the review of the safety database led a serious adverse event previously reported by a clinical investigator in a clinical study of tysabri in crohn s disease to be reassessed as pml 
the case was originally reported by the investigator as malignant astrocytoma in july the patient died in december the patient had received doses of tysabri over an month period and prior medication history included multiple courses of immunosuppressant agents 
we and elan are working with clinical investigators to evaluate patients treated with tysabri in clinical studies and are consulting with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of pml 
the outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine future commercial availability 
we cannot predict the outcome of these evaluations 
an unfavorable or inconclusive outcome could result in the permanent withdrawal of tysabri from the market and termination of clinical studies of tysabri  or the re introduction of tysabri to the market with significant restrictions on its permissible uses  blackbox or other significant safety warnings in its label and such other restrictions  requirements and limitations as the fda may require 
while we presently believe that we will be able to find a path forward for tysabri  there are no assurances as to the likelihood of success 
in 
table of contents light of our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that our tysabri inventory will be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life  we have written down all of the million of tysabri inventory that had been included on the balance sheet as of december   which was charged to cost of product revenues 
we are continuing to manufacture tysabri 
because of the uncertainty described above  in the first quarter of  we also expect to expense between million to million of tysabri that was manufactured in the first quarter of in subsequent periods  we will continue to assess tysabri to determine if it needs to be expensed in light of existing information related to the potential future commercial availability of tysabri and applicable accounting standards 
see forward looking information and risk factors that may affect future results safety issues with tysabri could significantly affect our growth 
we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if there are further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write offs may be required 
this periodic review led to the write downs of tysabri inventory as of december  and the expensing of tysabri expected to occur in the first quarter of  as described above  and may lead us to expense tysabri in subsequent periods 
also included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to dating expiration  in all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value 
in  we wrote down million  million  million and million of unmarketable inventory related to avonex  zevalin  amevive and tysabri  respectively  which was charged to cost of product revenues 
the avonex and amevive inventory was written down when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications 
the zevalin inventory was written down when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications and when it was determined to not be marketable based on estimates of demand 
in  total cost of revenues was million and consisted of product cost of revenues of million and cost of royalty revenues of million 
in november  we recorded the inventory that we acquired from biogen  inc at its estimated fair value 
product cost of revenues consisted of million related to avonex  million related to zevalin and million related to amevive 
in  included in product cost of revenues was approximately million in fair market value purchase accounting adjustments related to avonex and amevive  which represents the difference between the cost of inventory recorded at the acquisition date and its historical manufacturing cost 
the increase to fair market value was recognized as cost of product revenues when the acquired inventory was sold or written down 
included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to dating expiration 
in all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value 
in  we wrote down million related to avonex  million related to amevive and million related to zevalin 
of the million write down related to avonex  million represented the increase to fair market value of inventory acquired at the merger and million represented the historical manufacturing costs 
the avonex inventory that was written down had been assessed as commercially viable and saleable and there were no known contingent issues at the acquisition date 
this inventory was recorded at the estimated selling price less the costs to complete  costs of disposal and a reasonable distribution profit allowance 
our products are required to meet numerous stringent quality specifications that are agreed upon with the fda at various times prior to and after approval 
based on quality testing performed subsequent to the merger date  we became aware of certain lots of our pre filled syringe formulation of avonex that previously had been approved for sale  but after additional testing no longer met the established quality specifications 
substantially all of the avonex inventory write down was related to our pre filled syringe formulation of avonex  in which certain lots had aggregate levels that exceeded the approved specifications 
as a result of extensive discussions with the fda  a new set of testing protocols were agreed to and certain lots were deemed unmarketable 
upon management s determination that the inventory was unmarketable  we wrote off the carrying value of the inventory in the fourth quarter of because the cost of the inventory would not be recoverable 
in  we developed a new pre filled syringe formulation of avonex  
table of contents which was approved by the emea in november and the fda in march we do not expect to experience interruption in the supply of avonex 
however  we expect to write down between million and million of the remaining supplies of the older formulation in the first quarter of  related to the fda approval 
non gaap gross margin on product revenues  which includes inventory written down to its net realizable value  was approximately and in and  respectively 
the large fluctuation of gross margin on product revenues is due primarily to inventory acquired from biogen  inc through the merger 
during  we recorded the inventory that we acquired from biogen  inc at its estimated fair value 
the increase in fair market value was recognized as cost of product revenues when the acquired inventory was sold or written down 
during the first half of  we sold or wrote down all remaining avonex inventory acquired through the merger 
as a result  we expect that gross margins will increase during excluding the increase in fair market value related to purchase accounting and the effects of write downs of commercial inventory to net realizable value  gross margins of product revenues would have been and in and  respectively 
we expect that gross margins will fluctuate in the future based on changes in product mix  write downs of excess or obsolete inventories and new product initiatives 
gross margin on royalty revenues were approximately and in and  respectively 
we expect that gross margins on royalty revenues will fluctuate in the future based on changes in sales volumes for specific products from which we receive royalties 
research and development expenses research and development expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in research and development expenses in over primarily related to a full year of the former biogen  inc expenses in compared to the period from november  through december  the increase related to the former biogen  inc was million and consisted primarily of million of expenses related to pre clinical research activities  million of development research activities  including clinical trials  related to tysabri and amevive  million of biopharmaceutical operations expenses mainly attributable to manufacturing and supply chain functions  million of increased depreciation and infrastructure costs related to the expansion of our manufacturing and research facilities  and million for our joint development collaboration agreements 
the increase in research and development expenses in over primarily related to the acquisition of biogen  inc which contributed million in research and development expenses for the period from november  through december   a million payment to genentech in conjunction with entering into an amended and restated collaboration agreement in june  a million increase in personnel expenses resulting from the expansion of our manufacturing and research functions  a million increase in contract research and manufacturing expenses primarily related to oncology development and a million increase in manufacturing expenses recorded as research and development 
research and development expenses are expected to increase in we expect to continue incurring additional research and development expenses due to work with clinical investigators and neurological experts related to our evaluations of tysabri resulting from the suspension of tysabri from the market in february  preclinical and clinical testing of our various products under development  the expansion or addition of research and development programs and facilities  technology in licensing  and regulatory related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  primarily related to a full year of the former biogen  inc expenses in compared to the period from november  through december  the increase related to the former biogen  inc was million and consisted primarily of million of expenses related to neurology and dermatology sales and marketing activities  primarily due to the launch of tysabri  million of 
table of contents expenses related to our international selling  general and administrative initiatives  million of expenses related to our finance and information technology infrastructure  and million of expenses related to the expansion of our global medical affairs phase iv initiatives 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  primarily related to the acquisition of biogen  inc which contributed million in selling  general and administrative expenses for the period from november  through december   including million related to restructuring costs associated with the relocation of our european headquarters  a million increase in personnel expenses resulting from the expansion in sales and marketing expenses to support the commercialization of zevalin  a million increase in legal fees to protect our intellectual property rights  a million increase in insurance expenses due to higher premiums  a million increase in travel expenses primarily related to integration efforts associated with the merger with biogen  inc  and a million increase in information technology expenses with the remaining increase due to the expansion of our administrative function to support growth in manufacturing and research 
in  we recorded charges of million related to severance obligations for certain employees affected by the merger in our san diego facilities 
at december   we had a remaining accrual of approximately million related to the san diego severance obligations 
in  we accrued approximately million of restructuring costs related to the relocation of our european headquarters 
our remaining liability related to these european headquarters restructuring costs was million at december  in  we accrued million of restructuring costs related to severance obligations for certain employees affected by the merger in our cambridge facilities  and accrued an additional million of charges in at december   our remaining liability related to the cambridge severance obligations was million 
we anticipate that total selling  general  and administrative expenses in will be higher than due to sales and marketing and other general and administrative expenses to primarily support avonex and tysabri  despite the voluntary suspension of the marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri in february  and legal expenses related to lawsuits  investigations and other matters resulting from the suspension of tysabri 
other income expense  net december  in thousands interest income interest expense other expense total other income expense  net interest income totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in interest income in as compared to is primarily due to higher cash levels and higher yields on our marketable securities portfolio 
the decrease in interest income in as compared to is primarily due to lower rates of return on marketable securities available for sale on our investments 
interest income levels that may be achieved in the future are  in part  dependent upon market conditions 
interest expense totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in interest expense in compared to related to an updated estimation of the life of the senior notes due in  which we expect holders will require us to repurchase in april as a result  amortization of the issuance costs related to the senior notes increased million 
this was offset by lower noncash interest expense due to conversions throughout of our subordinated notes issued in february  and higher capitalized interest expense in the decrease in interest expense in compared to is due to the capitalization of million in and million in of interest costs largely related to the development of a consolidated west coast research and development and administration campus

in october  biogen  inc established the biogen foundation  a private  us based  non profit philanthropic organization 
in december  biogen  inc made a charitable contribution of million to fund the biogen foundation 
as a result of the merger  we changed the name of the foundation to the biogen idec foundation and  in december contributed an additional million 
the foundation is to operate exclusively for the benefit of charitable  educational and scientific purposes 
certain executive officers and other employees serve as directors and officers of the foundation 
we classify charitable contributions to other income expense 
in december  we recorded charges of million and million related to the final settlement of patent infringement disputes with apoxis sa and corixa corporation  respectively 
these payments were charged to other expense in the fourth quarter of acquired in process research and development in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a charge of million related to the write off of acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  related to the merger 
the amount expensed as ipr d represents the estimated fair value of purchased in process technology for projects that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the estimated fair value of these projects was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model 
for each project  the estimated after tax cash flows were probability weighted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization 
these cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 
as of december   we estimated future research and development expenses of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  would be incurred to complete the purchased neurology  dermatology  and rheumatology research projects 
since the date of the merger  november   we have discontinued certain clinical trials 
additionally  in connection with the voluntary suspension of marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri in february  we suspended dosing in clinical trials of tysabri in ms  crohn s disease and ra 
estimates of expenses are net of any research and development expenses that were shared under collaborations with corporate partners 
the projects  which were in various stages of development  from preclinical through phase iii clinical trials  are  unless they have been discontinued  expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from through the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects are that we will not be able to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology with data from clinical trials and that we will not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
no assurance can be given that the 
table of contents underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize  as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary significantly from estimated results 
amortization of intangible assets in and  we recorded amortization expense of million and million  respectively  related to the intangible assets of billion acquired in the merger with biogen  inc intangible assets consist of billion in core technology  million in patents and million in trademarks 
amortization of the core technology is provided over the estimated useful lives of the technology ranging from to years  based on the greater of straight line basis or economic consumption each period 
amortization of the out licensed patents for which we receive royalties is provided over the remaining lives of the patents of years 
trademarks have an indefinite life and  as such  are not amortized 
we review our intangible assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the third quarter of  management determined that certain clinical trials would not continue which indicated that the carrying value of certain core technology intangible assets related to amevive may not be recoverable 
as a result  in the third quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to amortization of acquired intangible assets  which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of core technology intangible assets related to amevive 
if future events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable  we may be required to record additional charges to our results of operations 
income tax provision our effective tax rate in was approximately compared to in and in our effective tax rate for varied substantially from the us federal statutory rate and prior years primarily due to the ipr d write off in  the acquisition related intangible amortization and inventory fair value adjustments arising from purchase accounting related to foreign jurisdictions offset  in part  by the effect of lower income tax rates less than the us statutory corporate rate in certain non us jurisdictions in which we operate and tax credits allowed for research and experimentation expenditures in the us excluding the effect of purchase accounting adjustments  our adjusted effective tax rate would have been approximately 
our effective tax rate for varied substantially from the us federal statutory rate and prior years primarily due to the pre tax loss resulting from the write off of non deductible ipr d and other costs in connection with the merger with biogen  inc which were not deductible for income tax purposes 
excluding the effect of our write off of ipr d  our effective tax rate would have been approximately 
our effective tax rate for was higher than the federal statutory rate primarily because of state taxes 
we have tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes available to offset future taxable income 
the utilization of our tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation under the internal revenue code due to a cumulative change of ownership of more than in prior years 
however  we anticipate that this annual limitation will result only in a slight deferral in the utilization of our net tax credits 
during  we decreased our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to zero 
each reporting period we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets based upon the level of historical taxable income and income tax liabilities and projections for future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets are either tax deductible or to which our tax credits may be carried 
based on the evaluation performed as of december   we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the entire benefits of our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates of future taxable income or we adjust our estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
financial condition we have financed our operating and capital expenditures principally through profits and other revenues from our joint business arrangement with genentech related to the sale of rituxan  sales of avonex  amevive  and zevalin  royalty revenues  corporate partner revenues  debt financing transactions and

we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may  from time to time  seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements  strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources 
our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the continued commercial success of avonex and rituxan and  to a lesser extent  amevive and zevalin  the future commercial availability of tysabri if we are able to re launch this product  the timing and expense of obtaining regulatory approvals for products in development  the cost of launching new products  and the success of those products  funding and timing of payments related to several significant capital projects  the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing  fluctuating or increasing manufacturing requirements and research and development programs  levels of resources that we need to devote to the development of manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  including resources devoted to the marketing of avonex  rituxan  amevive  and zevalin and future products  as well as the future marketing and manufacturing of tysabri if we are able to re launch this product  technological advances  status of products being developed by competitors  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations  and working capital required to satisfy the options of holders of our senior notes and subordinated notes to require us to repurchase their notes on specified terms or upon the occurrence of specified events

the contingent interest payable per senior note with respect of any quarterly period within such nine month period where contingent interest is determined to be payable will equal the greater of the amount of regular cash dividends paid by us per share on our common stock during that quarterly period multiplied by the then applicable conversion rate or of the average market price of a senior note for the five trading day measurement period preceding such nine month period  provided that if we do not pay regular cash dividends during a semiannual period  we will pay contingent

in addition  holders of the senior notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the senior notes on april    and at a price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase  payable in cash 
we expect that on april   holders of the senior notes will require us to purchase all or a substantial portion of the notes which could result in a cash outflow of up to approximately million 
this outflow includes payment of the aggregate purchase price of the notes of approximately million plus the payment of tax for which deferred tax liabilities have been previously established related to additional deductible interest expense

as required by applicable law  our board of directors is currently considering the letters and will respond in a time and manner consistent with delaware law 
we are providing information to the sec regarding the sec s informal inquiry into the suspension of marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri and trading in our securities by certain of our directors  officers and employees 
on july   biogen  inc now biogen idec ma  inc  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  along with genzyme corporation and abbott bioresearch center  inc  filed suit against the trustees of columbia university in the city of new york  or columbia  in the us district court for the district of massachusetts  contending that we no longer have any obligation to pay royalties to columbia on sales of our products under a license agreement between us and columbia related to us patent nos 
  and  also referred to as the original patents  or under a newly issued patent  us patent no 
 also referred to as the patent the action 
based  in part  on the court s subsequent finding that we had made a strong showing that we might prevail in proving the patent is invalid under the doctrine of non statutory double patenting  columbia has since covenanted not to sue biogen idec ma  inc on any claim of the patent and any claim that is the same or substantially the same as the claims of the patent if such claim s emerge from the reexamination or reissue proceedings currently pending before the us patent and trademark office  or uspto  with respect to the patent 
as a result of columbia s covenant not to sue  and columbia s assertion that biogen idec ma  inc is a licensee in good standing  the court issued an order on november   in which it dismissed biogen idec ma inc s claims for declaratory relief for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
at this time  we are unable to predict whether any claims will issue from the uspto on the reexamination or reissue proceedings concerning the patent  or whether  if any claims do issue  such claims will pose a risk of infringement with respect to our activities 
on september   biogen idec inc  biogen idec ma  inc  and genzyme corporation  filed suit against columbia in the us district court for the district of massachusetts the action 
in the action we reasserted some of the contentions made in our complaint in the action filed in action 
for example  that we are seeking a declaratory judgment that we have no obligation to pay any further royalties under the license agreement because the original patents have expired and the patent is invalid and unenforceable  and that columbia should be permanently enjoined from demanding any further royalties based on the patent or on any pending continuations  continuations in part  or divisional applications of 
table of contents the original patents 
we have also asserted claims for relief based on abuse of process  breach of contract  violation of massachusetts laws concerning unfair and deceptive trade practices  prosecution laches and inequitable conduct 
to date  columbia has refused to extend its covenant not to sue on the patent to biogen idec inc in the event that we are unsuccessful in the present litigation and columbia asserts a claim for infringement against biogen idec inc  we may be liable for damages suffered by columbia with respect to unpaid royalties and such other relief as columbia may seek and be granted by the court 
at this stage of the litigation  we cannot make any estimate of a potential loss or range of loss 
on august   classen immunotherapies  inc filed suit against us  glaxosmithkline  chiron corporation  merck co  inc  and kaiser permanente  inc  in the us district court for the district of maryland  contending that we induced infringement of us patents    and  all of which are directed to various methods of immunization or determination of immunization schedules 
the inducement of infringement claims are based on allegations that we provided instructions and or recommendations on a proper immunization schedule for vaccines to other defendants who are alleged to have directly infringed the patents at issue 
we are investigating the allegations  however  we do not believe them to be based in fact 
under our license agreement with glaxosmithkline  glaxosmithkline is obligated to indemnify and defend us against these claims 
in the event that the nature of the claims change such that glaxosmithkline is no longer obligated to indemnify and defend us and we are unsuccessful in the present litigation we may be liable for damages suffered by classen and such other relief as classen may seek and be granted by the court 
at this stage of the litigation  we cannot make any estimate of a potential loss or range of loss 
along with several other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  biogen  inc now biogen idec ma  inc  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries or  in certain cases  biogen idec inc  was named as a defendant in lawsuits filed by the county of suffolk  new york  the county of westchester  new york  the county of rockland  new york  the county of nassau  new york  the county of onondaga  new york  the county of chenango  new york  the county of erie  new york  the city of new york  and the county of chautauqua  new york 
all of the cases are pending in the us district court for the district of massachusetts  with the exception of the onondaga  chenango and chautauqua lawsuits  which are expected to be transferred to the us district court for the district of massachusetts  and the erie lawsuit  which is pending in the supreme court of the state of new york for the county of erie 
the complaints allege that the defendants fraudulently reported the average wholesale price for certain drugs for which medicaid provides reimbursement  also referred to as covered drugs  marketed and promoted the sale of covered drugs to providers based on the providers ability to collect inflated payments from the government and medicaid beneficiaries that exceeded payments possible for competing drugs  provided financing incentives to providers to over prescribe covered drugs or to prescribe covered drugs in place of competing drugs  and overcharged medicaid for illegally inflated covered drugs reimbursements 
the complaints allege violations of new york state law and advance common law claims for unfair trade practices  fraud  and unjust enrichment 
in addition  all of the complaints  with the exception of the county of erie  allege that the defendants failed to accurately report the best price on the covered drugs to the secretary of health and human services pursuant to rebate agreements entered into with the secretary of health and human services  and excluded from their reporting certain drugs offered at discounts and other rebates that would have reduced the best price 
the suffolk  westchester  rockland  and nassau county complaints also claim that biogen violated the racketeering influence and corrupt organizations act rico usc c 
in september  biogen joined other named defendants in filing a motion to dismiss the suffolk county complaint 
biogen also separately filed a motion on its own behalf arguing that the plaintiffs made no specific factual allegations against biogen to connect it with the alleged scheme 
in september  the court  in ruling on defendants joint motion to dismiss  allowed the motion  in part  and dismissed the rico claim  the medicaid best price claim  the breach of contract claim  and the common law fraud claim 
the court did not dismiss the claims brought under the new york state medicaid and social services statutes  the unfair trade practices claim  or the claim for unjust enrichment 
in october  the court issued a partial decision on biogen s individual motion to dismiss 
the court dismissed all of the state law claims against biogen based on the alleged failure to report best price  but deferred ruling on the fraud based claims and ordered suffolk county to produce all documents in support of its fraud based claims 
suffolk county subsequently produced 
table of contents documents in response to the court s request and biogen renewed its motion to dismiss 
neither biogen nor the other defendants have answered or responded to the other complaints  as all of the plaintiffs except erie county have agreed to stay the time to respond until the resolution of the pending motion to dismiss the suffolk county complaints 
biogen idec intends to defend itself vigorously against all of the allegations and claims in these lawsuits 
at this stage of the litigation  we cannot make any estimate of a potential loss or range of loss 
in addition  we are involved in certain other legal proceedings generally incidental to our normal business activities 
while the outcome of any of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted  we do not believe the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters would have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and related allowances  marketable securities  derivative and hedging activities  inventories  patents  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  impairment for intangible assets and goodwill  valuation of long lived assets and investments  research and development  loans  pensions  retiree medical plan  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  superceded in part by sab  provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
sab establishes the sec s view that it is not appropriate to recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sab also requires that both title and the risks and rewards of ownership be transferred to the buyer before revenue can be recognized 
we believe that our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with sab product revenue consists of sales from our four products avonex  amevive  zevalin  and tysabri 
the timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings 
revenues from product sales are recognized when product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  typically upon delivery 
revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for returns  patient assistance  trade term discounts  medicaid rebates  veteran s administration rebates  and managed care discounts and other applicable allowances 
included in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and  are allowances for returns  rebates  discounts and other allowances which totaled million and million  respectively 
at december   our allowance for product returns was million 
at december   total discounts and allowances were approximately of total current assets and less than of total assets 
we prepare our estimates for sales returns and allowances  discounts and rebates quarterly based primarily on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
if actual future results vary  we may need to adjust our estimates  which could have an impact on earnings in the period of adjustment 
in the past  our estimates based on historical experience have not materially differed from actual results 
we closely monitor levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
at december   we had approximately  on average  to weeks of inventory in the distribution channel 
the shelf life associated with 
table of contents our products is long to months  depending on the product  therefore obsolescence due to dating expiration has not been a historical concern  given the rapidity in which our products move through the channel 
changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us 
we do not provide incentives to our distributors to assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in our consolidated statements of income related to sales returns and allowances  discounts  and rebates 
our sales returns and allowances  discounts  and rebates in were substantially higher than  since sales returns and allowances  discounts  and rebates related to avonex and amevive were included in our results of operations for all of as opposed to  when sales returns and allowances  discounts  and rebates related to avonex and amevive were included in our results of operations only for the period from november  through december  in  the amount of product returns was approximately of product revenue for all our products 
product returns were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
product returns in included million related to product sales made prior to during  we had encountered problems in manufacturing our pre filled syringe formulation of avonex 
as a result  we had an increase in our expected level of returns related to batches that failed to meet specifications 
in november  we received regulatory approval in the us of tysabri for the treatment of ms and paid a million approval based milestone to elan 
upon approval  we also became obligated to provide elan with million in credits for payments on certain purchases of tysabri and for reimbursement of commercialization costs 
elan can apply million of the credits per year 
the approval and credit milestones were capitalized upon approval in investments and other assets and are being amortized over the remaining patent life of years 
the amortization of the approval and credit milestones is being recorded as a reduction of revenue 
in february  in consultation with the fda  we and elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri  and informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of tysabri until further notification 
under our agreement with elan  we manufacture tysabri and  in the us prior to the suspension  sold tysabri to elan who then distributed tysabri to third party distributors 
in the us  we record revenue when tysabri is shipped from elan to third party distributors 
in december  we recorded million of product revenues related to sales of tysabri to elan 
additionally  as of december   we deferred million in revenue related to sales of tysabri  which had not yet been shipped by elan 
as of december   elan owed us million  representing commercialization and development expenses incurred by us to be reimbursed by elan  which we received from elan in the first quarter of revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of our share of the rituxan pretax copromotion profits generated from our copromotion arrangement with genentech  reimbursement from genentech of our rituxan related sales force and development expenses and royalties from genentech for sales of rituxan outside the us by roche and zenyaku 
under the copromotion arrangement  all us sales of rituxan and associated costs and expenses are recognized by genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis  as defined in our amended and restated collaboration agreement with genentech 
pretax copromotion profits under the copromotion arrangement are derived by taking us net sales of rituxan to third party customers less cost of sales  third party royalty expenses  distribution  selling and marketing expenses and joint development expenses incurred by genentech and us 
our profit sharing formula with genentech has two tiers  we earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met 
the profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier 
in june  we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with genentech to include the development and commercialization of one or more anti cd antibodies targeting b cell disorders  in addition to rituxan  for a broad range of indications 
upon approval of the first new anti cd product  the pretax copromotion profit sharing formula for rituxan and other anti cd products will change over a period of time to a fixed annual profit sharing percentage at the lower tier 
currently  we record our share of expenses incurred for the development of new anti cd products in research and development expense until such time as a new product is approved  
table of contents at which time we will record our share of pretax copromotion profits related to the new product in revenues from unconsolidated joint business 
we record our royalty revenues on sales of rituxan outside the us on a cash basis 
under the amended and restated collaboration agreement  we will receive lower royalty revenue from genentech on sales by roche and zenyaku of new anti cd products and only for the first eleven years from the date of first commercial sale of such new anti cd products 
in february  the fasb emerging issues task force  or eitf  released eitf issue no 
or eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf states that cash consideration including a sales incentive given by a vendor to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products or services and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement  rather than a sales and marketing expense 
we have various contracts with distributors that provide for discounts and rebates 
these contracts are classified as a reduction of revenue 
we also maintain select customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel 
in accordance with eitf  we have established the fair value of these contracts and  as provided by eitf  classified these customer service contracts as sales and marketing expense 
if we had concluded that sufficient evidence of the fair value did not exist for these contracts  we would have been required to classify these costs as a reduction of revenue 
we receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by us or to which the we have rights 
the license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product 
we record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period 
the relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid to us adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
we maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period which they become known  typically the following quarter 
historically  adjustments have not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees 
there are no future performance obligations on our part under these license agreements 
under this policy  revenue can vary due to factors such as resolution of royalty disputes and arbitration 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could affect future earnings 
biogen  inc purchase price allocation the purchase price related to the merger was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair market values as of the acquisition date 
an independent third party valuation firm was engaged to assist in determining the fair values of in process research and development  identifiable intangible assets  inventory and certain property  plant and equipment  and in determining the useful lives of such tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects  determining the product life and term of estimated future cash flows  and developing appropriate costs  expenses  depreciation and amortization assumptions  tax rates  discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
these assumptions are based on the best available information that we had at the time 
additionally  certain estimates for the purchase price allocation related to income taxes may change as subsequent information becomes available 
marketable securities we invest our excess cash balances in short term and long term marketable securities  principally corporate notes and government securities 
at december   substantially all of our securities were 
table of contents classified as available for sale 
all available for sale securities are recorded at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income in shareholders equity  net of related tax effects 
realized gains and losses and declines in value  if any  judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are reported in other expense 
in  we recognized a charge of approximately million for certain unrealized losses on available for sale securities that were determined to be other than temporary  because we believe the securities will be sold prior to a potential recovery of their decline in value 
any future determinations that unrealized losses are other than temporary could have an impact on earnings 
the cost of available for sale securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
we have established guidelines that maintain safety and provide adequate liquidity in our available for sale portfolio 
these guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates 
as part of our strategic product development efforts  we invest in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies with which we have collaborative agreements 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  addresses the accounting for investment in marketable equity securities 
as a matter of policy  we determine on a quarterly basis whether any decline in the fair value of a marketable security is temporary or other than temporary 
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in other comprehensive income in shareholders equity  net of related tax effects 
if a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is determined to be other than temporary  such marketable security is written down to its estimated fair value with a charge to current earnings 
the factors that we consider in our assessments include the fair market value of the security  the duration of the security s decline  and prospects for the company  including favorable clinical trial results  new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements 
in  we recognized a million charge for the impairment of an investment that was determined to be other than temporary 
any future determinations that unrealized losses are other than temporary could have an impact on earnings 
at december   we had no unrealized losses related to these marketable securities 
the fair market value of these marketable securities totaled million at december  we also invest in equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and fair value is not readily available 
these investments are recorded using the cost method of accounting and  as a matter of policy  we monitor these investments in private securities on a quarterly basis  and determine whether any impairment in their value would require a charge to current earnings  based on the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee  market prices of comparable public companies  and general market conditions 
at december   we included approximately million of investments in private securities in investments and other assets 
there were no significant charges to current earnings in  or for impairments of these investments 
recognition of impairments for these securities may cause variability in earnings 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method 
included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products  which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed 
our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval  when  based on management s judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
our accounting policy addresses the attributes that should be considered in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a product have met the definition of an asset as stipulated in fasb concepts statement no 
we assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints and impediments to approval  including safety  efficacy and potential labeling restrictions 
we evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used 
we consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could possibly hamper approval or commercialization 
we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or cause 
table of contents delay in commercialization 
we are sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to launch commercialization strategies 
we also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization  trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria 
finally  we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize 
there is a risk inherent in these judgments  which is the reason we disclose the risk and the potential for a change in judgment 
at december   all products included in inventory have been approved for sale by either the emea or fda 
in february  we and elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri based on reports of two serious adverse events that occurred in patients treated with tysabri in combination with avonex in ms clinical studies 
these events involved two cases  of pml  a rare and frequently fatal  demyelinating disease of the central nervous system 
in light of the two reports of pml  the companies initiated a systematic review of the tysabri safety database 
on march   we and elan announced that the review of the safety database led a serious adverse event previously reported by a clinical investigator in a clinical study of tysabri in crohn s disease to be reassessed as pml 
the case was originally reported by the investigator as malignant astrocytoma in july the patient died in december the patient had received doses of tysabri over an month period and prior medication history included multiple courses of immunosuppressant agents 
we and elan are working with clinical investigators to evaluate patients treated with tysabri in clinical studies and are consulting with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of pml 
the outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine future commercial availability 
we cannot predict the outcome of these evaluations 
an unfavorable or inconclusive outcome could result in the permanent withdrawal of tysabri from the market and termination of clinical studies of tysabri  or the re introduction of tysabri to the market with significant restrictions on its permissible uses  blackbox or other significant safety warnings in its label and such other restrictions  requirements and limitations as the fda may require 
while we presently believe that we will be able to find a path forward for tysabri  there are no assurances as to the likelihood of success 
in light of our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that our tysabri inventory will be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life  we have written down all of the million of tysabri inventory that had been included on the balance sheet as of december   which was charged to cost of product revenues 
we are continuing to manufacture tysabri 
because of the uncertainty described above  in the first quarter of  we also expect to expense between million and million of tysabri that was manufactured in the first quarter of in subsequent periods  we will continue to assess tysabri to determine if it needs to be expensed in light of existing information related to the potential future commercial availability of tysabri and applicable accounting standards 
see forward looking information and risk factors that may affect futures results safety issues with tysabri could significantly affect our growth 
we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write offs may be required 
this periodic review led to the write downs of tysabri inventory as of december  and the expensing of tysabri expected to occur in the first quarter of  as described above  and may lead us to expense tysabri in subsequent periods 
also included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to dating expiration  in all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value 
we wrote down million of unmarketable inventory during  which was charged to cost of product revenues and consisted of million related to avonex  million related to zevalin  million related to amevive and million to tysabri 
the avonex and amevive inventory was written down to net realizable value when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications 
the zevalin inventory was written down to net realizable value when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications as well as a determination that certain of the inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand 

table of contents income taxes income tax expense includes a provision for income tax contingencies  which we believe is adequate and appropriate 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this determination  under the applicable financial accounting standards  we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and the effects of viable tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future taxable income include  among other items  our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities costs  overhead costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract services and other outside costs 
research and development costs  including upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators  are expensed as incurred 
the timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in future research and development expense 
clinical trial costs include costs associated with contract research organizations  or cros 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and site monitoring costs  and data management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cro vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial costs and estimated clinical trial costs have not been material and are adjusted for in the period which they become known 
under this policy  research and development expense can vary due to accrual adjustments related to clinical trials 
derivatives and hedging activities we have operations in europe  japan  australia and canada in connection with the sale of avonex 
we also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily euro  swedish krona  british pound  japanese yen  swiss franc and canadian dollar 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk and do not engage in currency speculation 
we use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
we assess  both at their inception and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items 
we assess hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings to the extent significant 
if we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring  we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument  and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings 
under this policy  and in accordance 
table of contents with sfas  earnings may vary if the forecasted transaction does not occur  or if there is material hedge ineffectiveness or if the hedge ceases to be highly effective 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets to be held and used  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
long lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value less costs to sell 
in the third quarter of  management determined that certain clinical trials would be discontinued or would not be initiated which indicated that the carrying value of certain core technology intangible assets might not be recoverable 
as a result  in the third quarter of  we recorded a charge of approximately million to amortization of intangible assets  which reflects the adjustment to the valuation of certain core technology intangible assets related to amevive to its net realizable value 
if future events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of certain of these remaining assets may not be recoverable  we may be required to record additional charges to our results of operations 
in february  we and elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri based on reports of two serious adverse events that have occurred in patients treated with tysabri in combination with avonex in ms clinical studies 
these events involved two cases of pml  a rare and frequently fatal  demyelinating disease of the central nervous system 
in light of the two reports of pml  the companies initiated a systemic review of the tysabri safety database 
on march   we and elan announced that the review of the safety database led a serious adverse event previously reported by a clinical investigator in a clinical study of tysabri in crohn s disease to be reassessed as pml 
the case was originally reported by the investigator as malignant astrocytoma in july the patient died in december the patient had received doses of tysabri over an month period and prior medication history included multiple courses of immunosuppressant agents 
we and elan are working with clinical investigators to evaluate patients treated with tysabri in clinical studies and are consulting with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of pml 
the outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine possible re initiation of dosing in clinical studies and future commercial availability 
we cannot predict the outcome of these evaluations 
an unfavorable or inconclusive outcome could result in the permanent withdrawal of tysabri from the market and termination of clinical studies of tysabri  or the re introduction of tysabri to the market with significant restrictions on its permissible uses  blackbox or other significant safety warnings in its label and such other restrictions  requirements and limitations as the fda may require 
as a result of these events  we have assessed our long lived assets related to tysabri  which include intangible assets and facilities  and have determined that there are no impairments related to these assets as a result of the suspension of the marketing of tysabri 
however  should new information arise  we may be required to take impairment charges related to certain of our long lived assets 
see forward looking information and risk factors that may affect future results safety issues with tysabri could significantly affect our growth 
goodwill goodwill associated with the merger represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather subject to periodic review for impairment 
goodwill is reviewed annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill might not be recoverable 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed an assessment of our goodwill  and concluded that goodwill was not impaired at october  
table of contents as a result of the voluntary suspension of tysabri in february  we have performed an interim review for impairment 
we believe that the fair value of our legacy biogen  inc reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and therefore  we believe goodwill is properly valued as of the date of the filing of our form k 
however  should new information arise  we may need to reassess goodwill for impairment in light of the new information and we may be required to take impairment charges related to goodwill 
see forward looking information and risk factors that may affect future results safety issues with tysabri could significantly affect our growth 
notes payable in connection with our senior and subordinated notes payable  we capitalized certain issuance costs  which are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated outstanding term of the notes  according to eitf  increasing rate debt 
we currently expect that holders of the senior notes due in will require us to purchase all or a portion of the senior notes on april  as a result  we have reassessed the estimated term of this debt  and recorded additional interest expense of approximately million in the fourth quarter of we have also classified our senior notes as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the remaining unamortized issuance costs of approximately million will be amortized through april  contingencies and litigation there has been  and we expect there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding commercial practices  regulatory issues  pricing  and patents and other intellectual property rights 
certain adverse unfavorable rulings or decisions in the future  including in the litigation described under legal matters  could create variability or have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
new accounting standards eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  was issued in february eitf stipulates disclosure requirements for investments with unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
we have complied with the disclosure provisions of eitf in september  the fasb staff issued two proposed fasb staff positions proposed fsp eitf issue a  which provides guidance for the application of paragraph of eitf issue to debt securities that are impaired because of interest rate and or sector spread increases  and proposed fsp eitf issue b  which delays the effective date of issue for debt securities that are impaired because of interests rate and or sector spread increases 
we are currently monitoring these developments and assessing the impact these will have on our results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  share based payments  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r will require all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
sfas r will be effective for public companies for fiscal periods beginning after june  and offers alternative methods for determining the fair value 
we expect that sfas r will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
at the present time  we have not yet determined which valuation method we will use 
the fasb has proposed amending sfas  earnings per share  to make it consistent with international accounting standard  earnings per share  and make earnings per share  or eps  computations comparable on a global basis 
under the proposed amendment  the year to date eps computation would be performed independently from the quarterly computations 
additionally  for all contracts that may be settled in either cash or shares of stock  companies must assume that settlement will occur by the issuance of shares for purposes of computing diluted eps  even if they intend to settle by paying cash or have a history of cash only settlements  regardless of who controls the means of settlement 
lastly  
table of contents under the proposed amendment  shares that will be issued upon conversion of a mandatory convertible security must be included in the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in computing basic eps from the date that conversion becomes mandatory  using the if converted method  regardless of whether the result is anti dilutive 
the proposed amended standard is expected to be issued during the first quarter of retrospective application in all periods presented would be required  and could require the conformance of previously reported eps 
we do not expect the provisions of the amended sfas will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
this statement amends arb  chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the provisions of sfas will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of non monetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 which eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
this statement specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of this statement shall be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect the provisions of sfas will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in december  the fasb reached consensus on eitf issue no 
 whether an investor should apply the equity method of accounting to investments other than common stock  which requires an investor that has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee to apply the equity method of accounting only when it has an investment s in common stock and or an investment that is in substance common stock 
the task force also reached a consensus on the definition of in substance common stock and related guidance 
the provisions of eitf are effective for reporting periods beginning after september   and have not had any impact on our accounting for investments as of december  under eitf no 
 accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination  the eitf reached a consensus that the consummation of a business combination between parties with a preexisting relationship should be evaluated to determine if a settlement of a preexisting relationship exists  thus requiring accounting separate from the business combination 
under eitf  the acquisition of a right that the acquiring entity had previously granted to the acquired entity to use the acquirer s recognized or unrecognized intangible assets for example  rights to the acquirer s trade name under a franchise agreement or rights to the acquirer s technology under a technology licensing agreement should be included as part of the business combination and recorded by the acquiring entity as an intangible asset at fair value 
if the contract giving rise to the reacquired right includes terms that are favorable or unfavorable when compared to pricing for example  royalty rates for current market transactions for the same or similar items  an entity should measure a settlement gain or loss as the lesser of a the amount by which the contract is favorable or unfavorable to market terms from the perspective of the acquirer or b the stated settlement provisions of the contract available to the counterparty to which the contract is unfavorable 
eitf is effective for all business combinations consummated and goodwill impairment tests ie  in step of the impairment test performed in reporting periods beginning after october  the provisions of eitf have not had any significant impact on our results of operations in
