magellan midstream partners  lp is a publicly traded limited partnership formed to own  operate and acquire a diversified portfolio of complementary energy assets 
we are principally engaged in the transportation  storage and distribution of refined petroleum products 
our three operating segments include petroleum products pipeline system  which is primarily comprised of our  mile petroleum products pipeline system  including terminals a portion of which was acquired during october as discussed in significant events below  petroleum products terminals  which principally includes our six marine terminal facilities and inland terminals  and ammonia pipeline system  representing our  mile ammonia pipeline and six associated terminals 
during april  we acquired magellan pipeline company  lp magellan pipeline for approximately billion from a wholly owned subsidiary of the williams companies  inc williams 
because williams was an affiliate of ours at the time of the acquisition  the transaction was between entities under common control and  as such  was accounted for similar to a pooling of interests 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements and notes have been restated to reflect the historical results of operations  financial position and cash flows of this pipeline system and us on a combined basis throughout the periods presented 
significant events indemnification settlement during may  we entered into an agreement with williams under which williams agreed to pay us million to release them from certain indemnifications 
the indemnifications primarily related to environmental items for periods during which williams was the owner of assets we purchased from them 
we received million from williams on july  and expect to receive the remaining balance in annual installments of million  million and million in july of  and  respectively 
see the environmental section below for further discussion of this matter 
refinancing also in may  we took steps to increase our financial flexibility  which included the issuance of one million common units and million of year senior unsecured notes 
we used the proceeds from these offerings primarily to refinance million of existing secured debt 
further  we amended our remaining secured debt instruments to release the collateral  resulting in our current unsecured capital structure 
see the liquidity section below for further discussion of our new debt structure 
pipeline acquisition during june  we announced our intention to acquire more than  miles of petroleum products pipeline system assets from affiliates of shell oil products us shell 
in anticipation of the transaction closing  we sold million common units during august to assist with the acquisition 
index to financial statements funding 
net proceeds from this sale were million  including our general partner s million contribution to maintain its general partner interest 
we closed the acquisition on october   and paid approximately million for the pipeline systems 
in addition  we paid approximately million for inventory related to a third party supply agreement for which we received million of cash collateral 
further  we assumed approximately million of existing liabilities and expect to incur million of transaction costs 
we have incurred approximately million of transaction costs through december  at the closing  we financed the acquisition with i cash on hand of approximately million  including net proceeds of approximately million from our august equity offering and net of an escrow payment of approximately million to shell in june  ii million of borrowings under a short term acquisition facility  and iii million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
during october  we issued and sold an additional million common units for net proceeds of approximately million  including our general partner s million contribution to maintain its general partner interest  and million of unsecured notes for net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds from the equity and debt offerings were used primarily to repay the borrowings under our short term acquisition facility and revolving credit facility 
the underwriters exercised their over allotment option associated with the october equity offering and on november   we issued and sold an additional million common units 
the net proceeds from this sale were approximately million  including our general partner s million contribution to maintain its general partner interest  which replaced cash we used to pay for other investments 
we have accounted for the assets we acquired from shell as an acquisition of assets for the following reasons i the assets we acquired were not operated historically as a separate division or subsidiary 
shell operated these assets as part of its more extensive transportation and terminalling and crude oil and refined products operations 
as a result  shell did not maintain complete and separate financial statements for these assets as an independent business unit  ii we intend to make significant changes to the assets in the future  including construction of additional connections between the acquired assets and our existing infrastructure  which may result in significant operating differences and revenues generated  and iii differences in our operating approach may result in our obtaining different revenues and results of operations than those historically achieved by shell 
beginning with fourth quarter  financial results from the majority of the acquired assets have been reported as part of our petroleum products pipeline system segment 
recent developments on january   the board of directors of our general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of per unit for the period of october through december  including this declaration  we paid distributions equal to per unit related to compared to per unit related to  an increase in excess of 
in addition  the per unit distribution represented a increase compared to our per unit distribution at the time of our initial public offering in february the quarterly distribution was paid on february  to unitholders of record on february  in january  magellan midstream holdings mmh  the owner of our general partner interest  sold  of our common units it held in a privately negotiated transaction 
further  in february  mmh sold an additional  common units 
following these sales and the february conversion of a portion of our subordinated units  mmh owned  common units   subordinated units and all of the ownership interests in our general partner  for a combined ownership interest in us 
overview in  our net cash from operating activities significantly exceeded our debt service obligations and cash distributions to our unitholders 
our petroleum products pipeline system generates a substantial portion of our cash flows 
the revenues generated from the petroleum products pipeline business are significantly influenced by demand for refined petroleum products  which has been growing in the markets we serve 
operating expenses are principally fixed costs related to routine maintenance and system integrity as well as field and support personnel 
other costs  including power  fluctuate with volumes transported and stored on the system 
expenses resulting 
index to financial statements from environmental remediation projects have historically included costs from projects relating both to current and past events 
for further discussion of indemnified environmental matters  see business environmental under item of this k report 
we expect to maintain or grow the cash flows of our petroleum products pipeline system as well as our other businesses in the future 
however  a prolonged period of high refined product prices could lead to a reduction in demand and result in lower shipments on our pipeline system 
in addition  increased pipeline maintenance regulations  higher power costs and higher interest rates could decrease the amount of cash we generate 
see risks related to our business for other factors which could impact our operations and cash flows 
petroleum products pipeline system 
our petroleum products pipeline system is a common carrier transportation pipeline and terminals network 
the system generates approximately of its revenues  excluding the sale of petroleum products  through transportation tariffs for volumes of petroleum products it ships 
these tariffs vary depending upon where the product originates  where ultimate delivery occurs and any applicable discounts 
all transportation rates and discounts are in published tariffs filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the petroleum products pipeline system also earns revenues from non tariff based activities  including leasing pipeline and storage tank capacity to shippers on a long term basis and by providing data services and product services such as ethanol unloading and loading  additive injection  custom blending and laboratory testing 
our petroleum products pipeline system generally does not produce  trade or take title to the products it transports 
however  the system does generate small volumes of product through its fractionation activities and we also purchase transmix which we then fractionate and sell 
additionally  we purchased a petroleum products management operation from williams in july  and we take title to the associated inventories and resulting products from that operation 
from april through june  we did not purchase and take title to the inventories or resulting products associated with this operation but performed services related to this operation for an annual fee 
in october  as part of our acquisition of assets from shell  we assumed a third party supply agreement which requires us to buy and sell significant quantities of petroleum products 
we routinely take title to these products under this agreement 
petroleum products terminals 
within our terminals network  we operate two types of terminals marine terminal facilities and inland terminals 
the marine terminals are large product storage facilities that generate revenues primarily from fees that we charge customers for storage and throughput services 
the inland terminals earn revenues primarily from fees we charge based on the volumes of refined petroleum products distributed from these terminals 
the inland terminals also earn ancillary revenues from injecting additives into gasoline and aviation fuel and filtering aviation fuel 
ammonia pipeline system 
the ammonia pipeline system earns the majority of its revenue from transportation tariffs that we charge for transporting ammonia through the pipeline 
effective february  we entered into an agreement with a third party pipeline company to operate our ammonia pipeline system 
operating costs and expenses charged to us are principally fixed costs related to routine maintenance as well as field personnel 
other costs  including power  fluctuate with volumes transported on the pipeline 
acquisition history we have significantly increased our operations over the past three years through the following acquisitions in october  the acquisition of a  mile petroleum products pipeline system  in march  the acquisition of a ownership interest in osage pipeline company  llc osage pipeline  in january  the acquisition of six inland terminals and the remaining ownership interest in eight terminals  in july  the acquisition of a petroleum products management business  and in april  the acquisition of a  mile petroleum products pipeline system 

index to financial statements results of operations we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management 
operating margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate the economic performance of our core operations 
this measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by management in deciding how to allocate capital resources between segments 
operating profit  alternatively  includes expense items  such as depreciation and amortization and general and administrative g a costs  which management does not consider when evaluating the core profitability of an operation 
operating margin is not a generally accepted accounting principles gaap measure  but the components of operating margin are computed by using amounts that are determined in accordance with gaap

index to financial statements transportation and terminals revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was a result of an increase in petroleum products pipeline system revenues of million  or  primarily attributable to additional revenues from our october pipeline system acquisition and significantly higher diesel and aviation fuel volume shipments on our existing pipeline system during the current period resulting from increased market demand due to the improving us economy 
further  management fee income associated with our operation of the longhorn pipeline beginning in and higher additive and tank lease revenues also contributed to the revenue increase  an increase in petroleum products terminals revenues of million  or  primarily due to additional revenues from our acquisition of ownership interests in inland terminals during january and our new marine terminal in east houston  texas  which was acquired as part of the pipeline system acquisition during fourth quarter further  higher utilization and rates at our marine terminals and increased throughput at our other inland terminals benefited the period  and an increase in ammonia pipeline system revenues of million  or  primarily due to significantly increased transportation volumes during the current year 
volumes increased in the current year primarily due to the implementation of a proportional credit program during late and higher farm commodity prices which increased demand for ammonia fertilizer 
operating expenses  environmental expenses and environmental reimbursements combined were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
by business segment  this increase was principally the result of an increase in petroleum products pipeline system expenses of million  or  primarily attributable to operating costs associated with the pipeline system acquired in october  unfavorable product loss allowances  asset retirements  higher allocated depreciation that is charged as an operating expense since third quarter  increased asset integrity costs and higher insurance expenses 
these increases were partially offset by lower employee costs due to a benefits accrual recorded during associated with the change in control of our general partner  an increase in petroleum products terminals expenses of million  or  primarily due to operating costs associated with acquisition of the ownership interests in inland terminals and the east houston marine terminal 
these increases were partially offset by reduced asset retirements and lower employee costs due to a benefits accrual recorded during associated with the change in control of our general partner  an increase in ammonia pipeline system expenses of million  or  primarily attributable to higher system integrity costs and environmental accruals  partially offset by lower property tax assessments during  and an increase in intersegment eliminations of million primarily due to higher allocations of corporate depreciation to the business segments as an operating expense 
we did not have depreciable assets recorded at the partnership level until third quarter revenues from product sales were million for the year ended december   while product purchases were million  resulting in a difference of million 
the difference between product sales and purchases in increased million as compared to the difference between products sales and purchases in of million resulting from product sales for the year ended december  of million and product purchases of million 
the increase in primarily reflects increased product sales from our acquisition of the petroleum products management operation in july the amount of product sales and product purchases increased substantially during primarily as a result of the third party supply agreement assumed as part of the assets we acquired from shell during october we expect the annual amount of product sales and purchases to increase in the future reflecting a full year of this agreement although the difference between product sales and purchases may remain substantially similar to results 

index to financial statements equity earnings were million during the year ended december  as a result of our acquisition of a interest in osage pipeline during march depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  primarily related to the additional depreciation expense associated with assets acquired during affiliate g a expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   a decline of million  or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the following items million lower incentive compensation expense during  primarily because of the early vesting of restricted units under our long term incentive plan that was triggered by the change in control of our general partner  and million lower transition costs associated with the separation of our g a functions from williams 
during  the transition costs were million  which principally included a benefits accrual and creation of our stand alone information technology functions 
comparatively  the period included million of transition costs 
we do not anticipate incurring any further transition costs related to our separation from williams 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in the amount of affiliate g a expense we record 
our general partner provides g a services to us for an established g a amount  which we refer to as the g a cap 
the owner of our general partner is responsible for g a expenses in excess of this g a cap up to a certain amount 
we record total g a costs  including those costs above the cap amount that are reimbursed by the owner of our general partner  as an expense  and we record the amount in excess of the g a cap for which we are reimbursed as a capital contribution by our general partner 
when williams owned our general partner  we were unable to identify specific costs required to support our operations 
as a result  we recorded only the g a costs under the g a cap as expense  which reflected our actual cash costs 
due to the change in our organizational structure following the change in control of our general partner in june  we are now able to clearly identify all g a costs required 
for and  the g a cap was million and million  respectively 
based on the agreement with our general partner  the amount of g a costs we pay increases by annually and by incremental g a expenses related to completed acquisitions 
the g a cap is expected to be million during interest expense  net of interest income  for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings decreased slightly from for the period to in the period due in part to our may debt refinancing 
our average debt outstanding increased from million during to million during primarily due to the financing associated with our october pipeline system acquisition 
refinancing costs associated with our may debt placement were million during the second quarter of these costs included a million debt prepayment premium related to the early extinguishment of our previously outstanding magellan pipeline series a senior notes and a million non cash write off of the unamortized debt placement costs associated with the retired debt 
partially offsetting these charges was a million gain on an interest rate hedge related to the refinancing 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
operating margin increased by million  or  primarily due to incremental operating results associated with our recent acquisitions and improved utilization of our other assets 
operating margin also improved during the current period due to lower operating expense transition costs associated with the change in control of our general partner in as 
index to financial statements compared to depreciation and amortization expense increased by million between periods  while g a costs decreased by million

this increase was a result of an increase in petroleum products pipeline system revenues of million  or  primarily attributable to a higher weighted average tariff and increased volumes during the current period 
the 
index to financial statements higher transportation rates per barrel principally resulted from tariff increases during july and april tariff adjustments generally occur during july of each year  as allowed by the ferc 
however  the april increase was allowed by the ferc due to a change to the mid year ferc defined tariff calculation 
the incremental volume resulted from the short term refinery production decreases in the mid continent region of the us these production decreases resulted in substitute volumes from alternative sources moving through our pipeline system 
further  increased revenues from higher data service fees as well as increased capacity leases and other ancillary revenues benefited the current year  an increase in petroleum products terminals revenues of million  or  primarily due to increased throughput at our inland terminals as volumes of a former affiliate were more than replaced with higher volumes from third party customers 
utilization at the gulf coast marine facilities was lower between the two periods due to the termination of a former customer s storage agreement at our galena park  texas facility during the first quarter of increased revenues from the resulting million settlement we received were more than offset by the resulting reduced storage utilization  and a decrease in ammonia pipeline system revenues of million  or  primarily due to significantly reduced transportation volumes during the first quarter of resulting from extremely high prices for natural gas  the primary component in the production of ammonia 
partially offsetting this volume decline was a higher weighted average tariff in operating expenses  environmental expenses and environmental reimbursements combined were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million was associated with a benefits accrual for operations employees related to the change in control of our general partner 
by business segment  this increase was the result of an increase in petroleum products pipeline system expenses of million  or  in part due to the million benefits accrual 
operating expenses further increased due to the retirement of assets and increased costs for tank maintenance and pipeline testing associated with the ongoing implementation of our system integrity program 
increased power costs resulting from higher transportation volumes and power rates as well as higher property taxes also resulted in greater costs during  a decrease in petroleum products terminals expenses of million  or  primarily due to reduced maintenance expenses resulting from efficiency projects that lowered contract labor and repair costs 
timing of tank inspection and cleaning further resulted in reduced maintenance expenses during these positive variances were partially offset by a charge associated with the retirement of an asset  a million benefits accrual and increased property taxes  and a decrease in ammonia pipeline system expenses of million  or  primarily due to the purchase in of right of way easements that had historically been leased 
revenues from product sales were million for the year ended december   while product purchases were million  resulting in a difference of million 
the difference between product sales and purchases in increased million as compared to the difference between product sales and purchases in of million resulting from product sales for the year ended december  of million and product purchases of million 
the increase in primarily reflects increased product sales from our acquisition of the petroleum products management operation during july from april through june  we provided services related to this operation for an annual fee rather than from buying and selling petroleum products 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  primarily due to the additional depreciation associated with acquisitions and capital improvements 

index to financial statements affiliate g a expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to the following items million of one time costs resulting from the change in ownership of our general partner during million of transition costs associated with the separation of our g a functions from williams 
the transition costs primarily included the creation of our stand alone information technology functions and a benefits accrual related to g a employees  and million of incentive compensation expense related to the early vesting of restricted units under our long term incentive plan that was triggered by the change in control of our general partner  and million of g a costs during the period above a cap that will be reimbursed by our general partner 
prior to the change in control of our general partner  we were unable to identify specific costs required to support our operations  consequently  we recorded g a costs only up to the g a cap as our expense  which reflected our actual cash cost 
interest expense  net of interest income  for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest expense was primarily related to the fourth quarter replacement of short term debt financing associated with the acquisition of the original segment of our petroleum products pipeline system with long term debt at higher interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings increased from in to in with the average debt outstanding increasing from million in to million in debt placement fee amortization declined from million in to million in  a million decline 
during the period  the short term debt associated with our acquisition of the original segment of our petroleum products pipeline system was outstanding with related debt costs amortized over the month period that the debt was outstanding 
our subsequent long term debt financing costs are amortized over the year life of the notes 
we do not pay income taxes because we are a partnership 
however  earnings from the petroleum products pipeline system were subject to income taxes prior to our acquisition of it in april taxes on these earnings were at income tax rates of for the year ended december   based on the effective income tax rate for williams as a result of williams tax sharing arrangement with its subsidiaries 
the effective income tax rate exceeds the us federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
operating margin increased by million over the prior year  despite million of one time operating expense items associated with the change in control of our general partner  largely as a result of increased transportation volumes and rates on our petroleum products pipeline system  increased differences between product sales and purchases associated with the purchase of our petroleum products management operation in july and reduced operating expenses associated with the petroleum products terminals 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  and g a costs increased by million  primarily due to one time costs associated with the change in control of our general partner and reimbursable g a costs 
net interest expense increased by million  while debt placement fee amortization expense decreased million 
other income declined million primarily due to a gain on the sale of assets during  and income taxes decreased million due to our partnership structure

net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   million for and million for the million increase from to was primarily attributable to increased net income of million including results from our operations associated with the assets acquired from shell in the fourth quarter of  a million prepayment premium during on our magellan pipeline series a senior notes  which reduced net income but has been classified as cash from financing activities  collection of million from williams during related to our indemnification settlement agreement  an increase in our equity based incentive compensation liability in versus of million primarily due to the settlement of awards during related to the change in ownership of our general partner  million lower cash payments in as compared to payments made during associated with our separation from williams  and a net increase in accounts receivable of million primarily due to increased accounts receivable resulting from the supply agreement assumed in connection with the assets acquired from shell 
this increase was largely offset by the receipt of million of cash collateral from the supply agreement customer 
the million decrease from to was primarily attributable to reduced net income of million principally resulting from the costs related to the change in control of our general partner  an increase in inventory of million during resulting from our july purchase of a petroleum products management operation 
a corresponding increase in accrued product purchases of million partially offset the inventory change  and non cash expenses associated with the change of control of our general partner in were generally offset by changes in our affiliate assets and liabilities

index to financial statements included the debt and equity financings that were completed in conjunction with our acquisition of assets from shell  partially offset by the repayment of debt in connection with our may refinancing and cash distributions paid 
cash was used during primarily to pay cash distributions to our unitholders 
cash provided during principally included the debt and equity offerings that were completed in conjunction with our acquisition of magellan pipeline  partially offset by cash distributions paid

if we continue to pay cash distributions at this current level and the number of outstanding units remains the same  total cash distributions of million will be paid to our unitholders in of this amount  million  or  would be related to our general partner s ownership interest and incentive distribution rights 
in connection with the october acquisition of assets from shell  our partnership agreement was amended to reduce the incentive cash distributions paid to our general partner by million in and million in without this amendment  the amounts paid to our general partner in  assuming the current quarterly distribution level of  would be million and total distributions would be million 
capital requirements our businesses require continual investment to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations 
capital spending for our businesses consist primarily of maintenance capital expenditures  such as those required to maintain equipment reliability and safety and to address environmental regulations  and payout capital expenditures to acquire additional complementary assets to grow our business and to expand or upgrade our existing facilities  referred to as organic growth projects 
organic growth projects include capital expenditures that increase storage or throughput volumes or develop pipeline connections to new supply sources 
during  our maintenance capital spending net of reimbursable projects was million 
in addition  we were reimbursed million for the following projects during  resulting in no cash impact to us million of reimbursable environmental projects covered by the indemnity settlement with williams  with the first settlement payment of million received from williams in july  million of reimbursements from the us government associated with grants for security enhancements at our marine terminal facilities  and million of reimbursements from our general partner for the remaining transition costs associated with our separation from williams 
for  we expect to incur maintenance capital expenditures net of reimbursable projects for our existing businesses of approximately million 
this increased spending expectation primarily relates to maintenance needs of the assets we acquired from shell in october  as well as higher costs due in part to timing of integrity work and upgrades to our operating systems 
in addition to maintenance capital expenditures  we also incur payout capital expenditures at our existing facilities 
during  we spent approximately million for organic growth opportunities and million for acquisitions 
based on projects currently in process  we plan to spend approximately million on organic growth payout capital during  exclusive of amounts associated with future acquisitions 
liquidity cash generated from operations is our primary source of liquidity for funding debt service  maintenance and payout capital expenditures and quarterly distributions 
additional liquidity for purposes other than quarterly distributions is available through borrowings under our revolving credit facility discussed below  as well as from 
index to financial statements other borrowings or issuances of debt or limited partner units 
if capital markets do not permit us to issue additional debt and equity  our business may be adversely affected and we may not be able to acquire additional assets and businesses 
in may  we completed a refinancing plan that improved our financial flexibility by providing for the release of the collateral previously securing our debt 
this refinancing plan further served to reduce the weighted average interest rate we incur and lowered our outstanding debt 
in october  we borrowed million under a short term acquisition facility and million under our revolving credit facility to partially finance the assets acquired from shell 
we repaid these borrowings in october using proceeds from public debt and equity offerings 
our short term acquisition facility was cancelled at that time 
as of december   we had million of total debt outstanding

debt to total capitalization 
the ratio of debt to total capitalization is a measure frequently used by the financial community to assess the reasonableness of a company s debt levels compared to its total capitalization  which is calculated by adding total debt and total partners capital 
based on the figures shown in our balance sheet  debt to total capitalization was at december  because accounting rules required the acquisition of a portion of magellan pipeline to be recorded at historical book values due to the then affiliate nature of the transaction  the million difference between the purchase price and book value at the time of the acquisition was recorded as a decrease to our general partner s capital account  thus lowering our overall partners capital by that amount

we have an agreement with mmh  an affiliate entity  for operating and g a costs associated with our activities 
the agreement requires us to pay for actual operating costs incurred by mmh on our behalf and for g a costs incurred on our behalf up to the expense limitations as imposed by the new omnibus agreement 
the agreement  which began in june  has a five year term but has provisions for termination upon day notice by either party 
as a result of the termination provision and the requirement to pay only mmh s costs as they are incurred  we are unable to determine the actual amount of this commitment 
the amount we paid mmh for operating and g a costs during  net of g a reimbursements  was million 
however  additional operating and g a costs associated with our acquisition of assets from shell during the fourth quarter of should cause these amounts to increase during and beyond 
we have an agreement to supply a customer with approximately thousand barrels of petroleum products per month until the agreement expires in related to this supply agreement  we have entered into certain forward contracts to purchase various petroleum products based on pricing structures during the first quarter of this amount is an estimated value of our product purchase commitments based on projected prices during the first quarter of on december   we had outstanding interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the fair value of million of our long term debt

we expect the amounts that will ultimately vest to our employees will exceed these amounts due to anticipated compensation liabilities that will be recognized over the remainder of the vesting periods and changes in our unit prices between december  and the date the unit awards actually vest 
environmental various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations subject us to environmental laws and regulations 
we have accrued liabilities for estimated site restoration costs to be incurred in the future at our facilities and properties  including liabilities for environmental remediation obligations at various sites where we have been identified as a possible responsible party 
under our accounting policies  we record liabilities when site restoration and environmental remediation obligations are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 

index to financial statements prior to may  williams provided indemnifications to us for assets we previously acquired from them 
the indemnifications primarily related to environmental items for periods during which williams was the owner of those assets 
in may  we entered into an agreement with williams under which they agreed to pay us million to release them from those indemnification obligations 
we received million from williams on july  and expect to receive the remaining balance in annual installments of million  million and million in july of  and  respectively 
as of december   known liabilities that would have been covered by these indemnifications were million 
in addition  we have incurred million of expenditures through december  that would have been covered by these indemnifications 
further  mmh has indemnified us against certain environmental liabilities 
at the time of mmh s purchase of williams ownership in us  mmh assumed obligations to indemnify us for million of known environmental liabilities 
through december   we have incurred million of costs associated with this indemnification obligation  leaving a remaining liability of million 
our receivable balance with mmh on december  was million 
other items we ship ammonia for three customers on our ammonia pipeline system 
the transportation agreements we have with these three customers expire at the end of june we are currently negotiating the terms of new transportation contracts to be effective in july if we are unsuccessful in renegotiating these contracts  it could have a significant impact on our revenues and results of operations after the current contracts expire 
impact of inflation although inflation has slowed in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment and may increase the costs of labor and supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and our existing agreements  we have and will continue to pass through increased costs to our customers in the form of higher fees 
critical accounting estimates our management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our general partner s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed and approved these disclosures 
environmental liabilities we estimate the liabilities associated with environmental expenditures based on site specific project plans for remediation  taking into account prior remediation experience 
remediation project managers evaluate each known case of environmental liability to determine what associated costs can be reasonably estimated and to ensure compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements 
we believe the accounting estimate relative to environmental remediation costs to be a critical accounting estimate because estimated expenditures  which will generally be made over the next to years  are subject to cost fluctuations and could change materially  unanticipated third party liabilities may arise and changes in federal  state and local environmental regulations could significantly increase the amount of the liability 
the estimate for environmental liabilities is a critical accounting estimate for all three of our operating segments 
a defined process for project reviews is integrated into our system integrity plan 
specifically  our remediation project managers meet once a year with accounting  operations  legal and other personnel to evaluate  in detail  the known environmental liabilities associated with each of our operating units 
the purpose of the annual project review is to assess all aspects of each project  evaluating what will be required to achieve regulatory compliance  estimating the costs associated with executing the regulatory phases that can be reasonably estimated and estimating the timing for those expenditures 
during the site specific evaluations  all known information is utilized in conjunction with professional judgment and experience to determine the 
index to financial statements appropriate approach to remediation and to assess liabilities 
the general remediation process to achieve regulatory compliance consists of site investigation delineation  site remediation and long term monitoring 
each of these phases can  and often does  include unknown variables that complicate the task of evaluating the estimated costs to completion 
each quarter  we re evaluate our environmental estimates taking into account any new incidents that have occurred since the last annual meeting of the remediation project managers  any changes in the site situation and additional findings or changes in federal or state regulations 
the estimated environmental liability accruals are adjusted as necessary 
changes in our environmental liabilities since december  are as follows in millions balance balance balance accruals expenditures accruals expenditures during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a leak on our petroleum products pipeline near kansas city  kansas  which resulted in an initial increase to our environmental liabilities of million 
we expected insurance proceeds to cover million of these costs and we charged the remaining million against income in the recommendations that came from the annual and quarterly review process during resulted in our increasing the environmental liabilities associated with over separate remediation sites by approximately million 
these accrual increases did not have a significant impact on our operating profit or net income because most of the increases were covered by indemnities from williams or insurance 
in may  our general partner entered into an agreement with williams under which williams agreed to pay us million to release williams from its environmental indemnification obligations to us 
from the effective date of our environmental indemnification settlement with williams  all accrual adjustments associated with amounts previously indemnified by williams are no longer reimbursed and therefore reduce our net income 
during  we increased our environmental accruals by million as a result of a million of environmental liabilities assumed through acquisitions completed during the year  b an additional increase of million associated with the kansas city leak discussed above  c a notification we received during from the epa of their intent to assess penalties against us related to certain specified pipeline spills  and d the quarterly and annual site assessments by our remediation project managers 
our known environmental liabilities at december  are based on estimates that are subject to change  and any changes to these estimates would impact our results of operations and financial position 
for example  if our environmental liabilities increased by as much as and assuming that none of this increase was covered by indemnifications or insurance  our expenses would increase by million 
because we pay no income taxes  operating profit and net income would decrease by the same amount  which represents a decrease of of our operating profit and of our net income for assuming our current distribution levels for the entire year  this additional expense would reduce both basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit by approximately 
such a change would increase our liabilities and decrease equity by approximately 
the impact of such an increase in environmental costs would likely not affect our liquidity because  even with the increased costs  we would still comply with the covenants of our long term debt agreements as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated using the straight line method over the asset s estimated useful life 
depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost  less its residual value if any  to the periods it benefits 
straight line depreciation results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the asset 
at december  and  the net book value of our property  plant and equipment was billion and billion  respectively and we recorded depreciation expense of million and million during and  respectively 

index to financial statements the determination of an asset s estimated useful life takes a number of factors into consideration  including technological change  normal depreciation and actual physical usage 
if any of these assumptions subsequently change  the estimated useful life of the asset could change and result in an increase or decrease in depreciation expense 
our terminals  pipelines and related equipment have estimated useful lives of three to years  with a weighted average asset life of approximately years 
if the estimates of our asset lives changed such that the average estimated asset life was years  our depreciation expense for would increase by million 
because we pay no income taxes  operating profit and net income would decrease by the same amount  which represents a decrease of of our operating profit and of our net income for assuming our current distribution levels for the entire year  this additional expense would reduce both basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit by approximately 
such a change would decrease total assets by less than and equity by approximately 
the impact of such an increase in depreciation costs would likely not have affected our liquidity because  even with the increased costs  we would still comply with the covenants of our long term debt agreements as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 share based payment  referred to as sfas no 
r 
this statement establishes accounting standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this revision requires that all equity based compensation awards to employees be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values  eliminating the alternative to use accounting principle board apb no 
s intrinsic value method 
the standard is effective as of the beginning of the first interim period that begins after june  this statement applies to all awards granted after the required effective date but is not to be applied to awards granted in periods before the required effective date except to the extent that awards from prior periods are modified  repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date 
we intend to adopt the statement on july   using the modified prospective application method 
under the modified prospective method we will be required to account for all of our equity based incentive awards granted prior to june  using the fair value method as defined in sfas no 
instead of our current methodology of using the intrinsic value method as defined in apb no 
our existing equity based awards are stock appreciation rights  as defined in fasb interpretation fin no 
as such  we recognize compensation expense under apb no

 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb no 

the guidance in apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends apb no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange

cash flows will include projections of future benefit payments and an estimate of contributions to be made in the next year to fund pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
in addition to expanded annual disclosures  the fasb is requiring companies to report the various elements of pension and other post retirement benefit costs on a quarterly basis

index to financial statements in and for the period january  through june   williams allocated both direct and indirect g a expenses to our general partner 
direct expenses allocated by williams were primarily salaries and benefits of employees and officers associated with our businesses 
indirect expenses included legal  accounting  treasury  engineering  information technology and other corporate services 
williams allocated these expenses to our general partner based on an agreed upon expense limitation 
the additional g a costs incurred but not reimbursed by williams totaled million in and million for the period january  through june  the g a costs allocated from williams for the periods discussed above included a number of costs that were not specific to our businesses and therefore cannot be used as an estimate of our g a costs during those periods 
additionally  in and for the period january  through june   williams allocated operating expenses to our general partner 
expenses included all costs directly associated with our operations 
on june   williams ownership in us was sold to mmh 
as a result  we entered into a new services agreement with mmh pursuant to which mmh agreed to perform specified services required for our operations 
consequently  our g a services are now provided by mmh and we now reimburse mmh for those costs  subject to the limitations as defined in the new omnibus agreement see reimbursement of g a expense below the additional g a costs incurred but not reimbursed by mmh are discussed below under reimbursement of g a expense 
from june  through december  operating expenses were allocated to our general partner from mmh 
williams agreed to reimburse us for maintenance capital expenditures incurred in in excess of million related to the assets contributed to us at the time of our initial public offering 
during  we recorded reimbursements from williams associated with these assets of million 
williams and certain of its affiliates had indemnified us against certain environmental costs

forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this annual report on form k include forward looking statements statements that discuss our expected future results based on current and pending business operations 
forward looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipates  believes  expects  estimates  forecasts  projects and other similar expressions 
although we believe our forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  statements made regarding future results are subject to numerous assumptions  uncertainties and risks that may cause future results to be materially different from the results stated or implied in this document 
the following are among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any results projected  forecasted  estimated or budgeted price trends and overall demand for natural gas liquids  refined petroleum products  natural gas  oil and ammonia in the united states  weather patterns materially different than historical trends  development of alternative energy sources  changes in demand for storage in our petroleum products terminals  changes in supply patterns for our marine terminals due to geopolitical events  our ability to manage interest rate and commodity price exposures  changes in our tariff rates implemented by the ferc and the united states surface transportation board  shut downs or cutbacks at major refineries  petrochemical plants  ammonia production facilities or other businesses that use or supply our services  changes in the throughput on petroleum products pipelines owned and operated by third parties and connected to our petroleum products terminals or petroleum products pipeline system  loss of one or more of our three customers on our ammonia pipeline system  an increase in the competition our operations encounter  the occurrence of an operational hazard or unforeseen interruption for which we are not adequately insured  our ability to integrate any acquired operations into our existing operations  our ability to successfully identify and close strategic acquisitions and expansion projects and make cost saving changes in operations  
index to financial statements changes in general economic conditions in the united states  changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject  including tax withholding issues  safety  environmental and employment laws and regulations  the cost and effects of legal and administrative claims and proceedings against us or our subsidiaries  the amount of our indebtedness  which could make us vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  place us at competitive disadvantages compared to our competitors that have less debt or could have other adverse consequences  the condition of the capital markets in the united states  the effect of changes in accounting policies  the potential that internal controls may not be adequate  weaknesses may be discovered or remediation of any identified weaknesses may not be successful and the impact that could have on our unit price  our ability to manage rapid growth  mmh s ability to perform on its environmental and g a reimbursement obligations to us  williams ability to pay the amounts owed to us under the indemnification settlement  the ability of our general partner to enter into certain agreements which could negatively impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows  supply disruption  and global and domestic economic repercussions from terrorist activities and the government s response thereto 
risks related to our business we may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to allow us to pay quarterly distributions at current levels following establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses  including payments to our general partner 
the amount of cash we can distribute on our common units principally depends upon the cash we generate from our operations 
because the cash we generate from operations will fluctuate from quarter to quarter  we may not be able to pay quarterly distributions at the current level for each quarter 
our ability to pay quarterly distributions depends primarily on cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  and not solely on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
as a result  we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net income 
potential future acquisitions and expansions  if any  may affect our business by substantially increasing the level of our indebtedness and contingent liabilities and increasing our risk of being unable to effectively integrate these new operations 
from time to time  we evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and businesses 
acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness 
if we consummate any future acquisitions  our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly 
acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired businesses  inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with new assets and the businesses associated with them and new geographic areas and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
further  unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined  and we may experience 
index to financial statements unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition 
following an acquisition  we may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions 
our financial results depend on the demand for the petroleum products that we transport  store and distribute 
any sustained decrease in demand for petroleum products in the markets served by our pipeline and terminals could result in a significant reduction in the volume of products that we transport in our pipeline  store at our marine terminals and distribute through our inland terminals  and thereby reduce our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions 
factors that could lead to a decrease in market demand include an increase in the market price of crude oil that leads to higher refined products prices  which may reduce demand for gasoline and other petroleum products 
market prices for refined petroleum products are subject to wide fluctuation in response to changes in global and regional supply over which we have no control  a recession or other adverse economic condition that results in lower spending by consumers and businesses on transportation fuels such as gasoline  aviation fuel and diesel  higher fuel taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that increase the cost of gasoline  an increase in fuel economy  whether as a result of a shift by consumers to more fuel efficient vehicles or technological advances by manufacturers  and the increased use of alternative fuel sources  such as fuel cells and solar  electric and battery powered engines 
several state and federal initiatives mandate this increased use 
when prices for the future delivery of petroleum products that we transport through our pipeline system or store in our marine terminals fall below current prices  customers are less likely to store these products  thereby reducing our storage revenues 
this market condition is commonly referred to as backwardation 
when the petroleum products market is in backwardation  the demand for storage capacity at our facilities may decrease 
if the market becomes strongly backwardated for an extended period of time  it may affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
fluctuations in prices of refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids could materially affect our earnings 
a third party supply agreement we assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets from shell requires that we maintain certain inventories of refined petroleum products 
in addition  we maintain product inventory related to our petroleum products management operation 
we are required to record these inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
significant decreases in market prices could require us to reduce the recorded value of these inventories  which would in turn reduce our earnings 
we depend on refineries and petroleum products pipelines owned and operated by others to supply our pipeline and terminals 
we depend on connections with refineries and petroleum products pipelines owned and operated by third parties as a significant source of supply for our facilities 
outages at these refineries or reduced throughput on these pipelines because of testing  line repair  damage to pipelines  reduced operating pressures or other causes could result in our being unable to deliver products to our customers from our terminals or receive products for storage and could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 

index to financial statements terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities could adversely affect our business 
since the september  terror attacks  the us government has issued warnings that energy assets  specifically our nation s pipeline infrastructure  may be future targets of terrorist organizations 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risks 
any future terrorist attack on our facilities  those of our customers and  in some cases  those of other pipelines  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business involves many hazards and operational risks  some of which may not be covered by insurance 
our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the transportation and distribution of refined petroleum products and ammonia  including ruptures  leaks and fires 
these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of our related operations 
we are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business 
in addition  as a result of market conditions  premiums for our insurance policies have increased significantly and could escalate further 
in some instances  insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
for example  insurance carriers are now requiring broad exclusions for losses due to war risk and terrorist and sabotage acts 
if a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured  it could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
rate regulation or a successful challenge to the rates we charge on our petroleum products pipelines may reduce the amount of cash we generate 
the ferc regulates the tariff rates for interstate movements on our petroleum products pipelines 
shippers may protest our pipeline tariff filings  and the ferc may investigate new or changed tariff rates and order refunds of amounts collected under rates that were in excess of a just and reasonable level 
in addition  shippers may challenge the lawfulness of tariff rates that have become final and effective 
the ferc may also investigate such rates absent shipper complaint 
the ferc s ratemaking methodologies may limit our ability to set rates based on our true costs or may delay the use of rates that reflect increased costs 
the ferc s primary ratemaking methodology is price indexing 
we use this methodology to establish our rates in approximately one third of our interstate markets 
the indexing method allows a pipeline to increase its rates by a percentage equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods ppi fg 
if the ppi fg falls  we could be required to reduce our rates that are based on the ferc s price indexing methodology if they exceed the new maximum allowable rate 
in addition  changes in the ppi fg might not be large enough to fully reflect actual increases in the costs associated with the pipelines subject to indexing 
the potential for a challenge to our indexed rates creates the risk that the ferc might find some of our indexed rates to be in excess of a just and reasonable level that is  a level justified by our cost of service 
in such an event  the ferc would order us to reduce any such rates and could require the payment of reparations to complaining shippers for up to two years prior to the complaint 
on july   the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued its opinion in bp west coast products  llc v 
ferc  which vacated the ferc s application of its lakehead policy with the result that no income tax allowance can be claimed by pipeline owners that are limited partners 
under that policy  the ferc has allowed a regulated entity organized as a master limited partnership to include in its cost of service an income tax allowance to the extent that its unitholders  or limited partners  were corporations subject to income tax 
because the court s ruling on the ferc s lakehead policy in bp west coast appears to focus on the facts and record presented to it in that case  it is not clear what impact  if any  the opinion will have on our indexed rates 
on december   the ferc issued a notice of inquiry that seeks comments regarding whether bp west coast applies only to the specific facts of that case  or whether it applies more broadly  and  if the latter  what effect that ruling might have on energy infrastructure investments 
it is not clear what action the 
index to financial statements ferc will ultimately take in response to bp west coast  to what extent such action will be challenged and  if so  whether it will withstand further ferc or judicial review 
nevertheless  a shipper might rely on this decision to challenge our indexed rates based on a changed circumstance argument 
if the ferc were to disallow our income tax allowance  it may be more difficult to justify our indexed rates on a cost of service basis 
however  because of the relatively small percentage of our unitholders that are corporations  which results in our including only a small income tax allowance in our cost of service  we do not believe that a challenge to our indexed rates based solely on the changed circumstance of the elimination of our income tax allowance would be likely to succeed 
we establish rates in approximately two thirds of our markets using the ferc s market based ratemaking regulations 
these regulations allow us to establish rates based on conditions in individual markets without regard to the index or our cost of service 
if successfully challenged  the ferc could take away our ability to establish market based rates 
we would then have to establish rates that would be justified on some other basis such as our cost of service 
any reduction in the indexed rates  removal of our ability to establish market based rates  or payment of reparations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and reduce the amount of cash we generate 
mergers among our customers and competitors could result in lower volumes being shipped on our pipelines or products stored in or distributed through our terminals  thereby reducing the amount of cash we generate 
mergers between existing customers could provide strong economic incentives for the combined entities to utilize their existing systems instead of ours in those markets where the systems compete 
as a result  we could lose some or all of the volumes and associated revenues from these customers and we could experience difficulty in replacing those lost volumes and revenues 
because most of our operating costs are fixed  a reduction in volumes would result not only in less revenues  but also a decline in net income and cash flow of a similar magnitude  which would reduce our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
the closure of mid continent refineries that supply our petroleum products pipeline system could result in disruptions or reductions in the volumes we transport and the amount of cash we generate 
the epa has adopted requirements that require refineries to install equipment to lower the sulfur content of gasoline and some diesel fuel they produce 
the requirements relating to gasoline took effect in  and the requirements relating to diesel fuel will take effect in and be implemented through if refinery owners that use our petroleum pipeline system determine that compliance with these new requirements is too costly  they may close some of these refineries  which could reduce the volumes transported on our petroleum products pipeline and the amount of cash we generate 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations that govern the environmental and operational safety aspects of our operations 
each of our operating segments is subject to the risk of incurring substantial costs and liabilities under environmental and safety laws 
these costs and liabilities arise under increasingly strict environmental and safety laws  including regulations and governmental enforcement policies  and as a result of claims for damages to property or persons arising from our operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and  to a lesser extent  issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations 
if we were unable to recover these costs through increased revenues  our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions could be adversely affected 
the terminal and pipeline facilities that comprise the petroleum products pipeline system have been used for many years to transport  distribute or store petroleum products 
over time our operations  or operations by our 
index to financial statements predecessors or third parties may have resulted in the disposal or release of hydrocarbons or solid wastes at or from these terminal properties and along such pipeline rights of way 
in addition  some of our terminals and pipelines are located on or near current or former refining and terminal sites  and there is a risk that contamination is present on those sites 
we may be held jointly and severally liable under a number of these environmental laws and regulations for such disposal and releases of hydrocarbons or solid wastes or the existence of contamination  even in circumstances where such activities or conditions were caused by third parties not under our control or were otherwise lawful at the time they occurred 
in addition  we own a number of properties that have been used for many years to distribute or store petroleum products by third parties not under our control 
in some cases  owners  tenants or users of these properties have disposed of or released hydrocarbons or solid wastes on or under these properties 
in addition  some of our terminals are located on or near current or former refining and terminal operations  and there is a risk that contamination is present on these sites 
the transportation of ammonia by our pipeline is hazardous and may result in environmental damage  including accidental releases that may cause death or injuries to humans and farm animals and damage to crops 
our business is subject to federal epa requirements that will lower the level of sulfur in diesel fuels beginning in june beginning in june  the allowable level of sulfur in on road and off road diesel fuel will begin to be lowered to levels that are substantially below current levels 
this transition may require us to invest substantial amounts of capital and incur substantial new operating costs that we may not be able to recover through increased revenues 
this transition may also require us to transfer low sulfur products to high sulfur products within our system as a result of product contaminations  which in turn could lead to lower product throughputs on our system 
the assets we acquired from shell in october are subject to a consent decree with the epa and we could incur substantial costs and liabilities to comply with this decree that are not covered by shell s indemnification of us 
in  shell entered into a consent decree with the epa arising out of a june incident unrelated to the assets we acquired from shell 
in order to resolve shell s civil liability for the incident  shell agreed to pay civil penalties and to comply with certain terms set out in the consent decree 
these terms include requirements for testing and maintenance of a number of shell s pipelines  including two of the pipelines we acquired  the creation of a damage prevention program  submission to independent monitoring and various reporting requirements 
the consent decree imposes penalties for non compliance for a period of at least five years from the date of the consent decree 
under our purchase agreement with shell  we agreed  at our own expense  to complete any remaining remediation work required under the consent decree with respect to these two pipelines and have assumed a liability of approximately million for this remediation work 
shell has agreed to retain responsibility under the consent decree for any ongoing independent monitoring obligations with respect to one of these pipelines 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations that govern the product quality specifications of the petroleum products that we store and transport 
petroleum products that we store and transport are sold by our customers for consumption into the public market 
various federal  state and local agencies have the authority to prescribe specific product quality specifications to commodities sold into the public market 
changes in product quality specifications could reduce our throughput volume  require us to incur additional handling costs or require the expenditure of capital 
for instance  different product specifications for different markets impact the fungibility of the system and could require the construction of additional storage 
if we are unable to recover these costs through increased revenues  our ability to meet our financial obligations could be adversely affected 

index to financial statements competition with respect to our operating segments could ultimately lead to lower levels of profits and reduce the amount of cash we generate 
we face competition from other pipelines and terminals in the same markets as our petroleum products pipeline system  as well as from other means of transporting  storing and distributing petroleum products 
in addition  our marine and inland terminals face competition from large  generally well financed companies that own many terminals  as well as from small companies 
our marine and inland terminals also encounter competition from integrated refining and marketing companies that own their own terminal facilities 
our customers demand delivery of products on tight time schedules and in a number of geographic markets 
if our quality of service declines or we cannot meet the demands of our customers  they may use our competitors 
we compete primarily with rail carriers for the transportation of ammonia 
if our customers elect to transport ammonia by rail rather than pipeline  we may realize lower revenues and cash flows and our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions may be adversely affected 
our ammonia pipeline also competes with another ammonia pipeline in iowa and nebraska 
our ammonia pipeline system is dependent on three customers pursuant to contracts that expire in june three customers ship all of the ammonia on our pipeline and utilize our six terminals 
we have contracts with these three shippers through june that obligate them to ship or pay for specified minimum quantities of ammonia 
one of these customers has a credit rating below investment grade 
the loss of any one of these three customers  their failure or inability to pay us or our inability to renegotiate these contracts at terms favorable to us could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
high natural gas prices can increase ammonia production costs and reduce the amount of ammonia transported through our ammonia pipeline system 
the profitability of our customers that produce ammonia partially depends on the price of natural gas  which is the principal raw material used in the production of ammonia 
an extended period of high natural gas prices may cause our customers to produce and ship lower volumes of ammonia  which could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
in connection with its acquisition from williams of interests in us and our general partner  mmh entered into a new omnibus agreement to provide g a services to us  which increased our g a expenses and reduced the amount of cash we generate 
a change in control of mmh or our general partner could further increase our g a expenses 
in connection with the sale to mmh by williams of of its ownership interests in our general partner and all of its limited partner interests in us  we are a third party beneficiary of an omnibus agreement with mmh 
there are limitations on the amount of g a expenses for which we are required to reimburse mmh and certain of its affiliates  which operate as follows for expenses below a lower cap amount  mmh and its affiliates are not required to make any reimbursements to us  for expenses above the lower cap amount and below an upper cap amount  mmh or its affiliates are required to reimburse us  and for expenses above the upper cap amount  mmh and its affiliates are not required to make any reimbursements to us 
the lower cap amount escalates annually at or  if greater  the percentage increase in the consumer price index  which is a higher escalation rate than was in effect prior to williams sale of its interests in us 
the upper cap amount escalates annually at the lesser of or the percentage increase in the consumer price index 
the upper and lower caps are further adjusted for incremental g a costs associated with acquisitions we consummate 

index to financial statements these limitations on our obligation to reimburse mmh and certain of its affiliates for g a expenses will terminate upon a change in control of mmh or our general partner 
a change in control of our general partner will be deemed to occur if  among other things  directors are elected whose nomination for election to our general partner s board of directors was not approved by our general partner or its board of directors or any nominating committee thereof at a time when the board was comprised of only such approved directors or the current directors 
in the event of a change in control  the amount of cash we generate will be reduced by any g a costs we incur above the lower cap as a result of our becoming liable for the full amount of g a costs 
termination by mmh of our services agreement with mmh could result in increased costs and limit our ability to meet our obligations and pay cash distributions 
in connection with mmh s acquisition of interests in us and our general partner  we entered into a new services agreement with mmh and our general partner 
the services provided under that agreement include accounting  building administration  human resources  information technology  legal and security  among others 
mmh has the right at any time to terminate its obligations under this services agreement upon days notice 
to the extent that neither mmh nor any of its subsidiaries  including our general partner  provides these services to us  the limitations under the new omnibus agreement on our reimbursement of g a expenses relating to these services would no longer apply and we may incur increased g a expenses  which could increase our costs and limit our ability to meet our obligations and pay cash distributions 
our general partner and its affiliates may have conflicts with our partnership 
the directors and officers of our general partner and its affiliates have duties to manage our general partner in a manner that is beneficial to mmh  its sole member 
at the same time  our general partner has duties to manage us in a manner that is beneficial to us 
therefore  our general partner s duties to us may conflict with the duties of its officers and directors to mmh 
such conflicts may include  among others  the following decisions of our general partner regarding the amount and timing of cash expenditures  borrowings and issuances of additional limited partnership units or other securities can affect the amount of incentive distribution payments we make to our general partner  under our partnership agreement  we reimburse our general partner for the costs of managing and operating us  under our partnership agreement  it is not a breach of our general partner s fiduciary duties for affiliates of our general partner to engage in activities that compete with us 
specifically  mmh  which owns our general partner  is partially owned by an affiliate of the carlyle riverstone fund  which also owns  through affiliates  an interest in the general partner of buckeye partners  lp buckeye partners and the general partner of semgroup and may acquire other entities that compete with us 
although we do not have extensive operations in the geographic areas primarily served by buckeye partners  we will compete directly with buckeye partners  semgroup and perhaps other entities in which the carlyle riverstone fund has an interest for acquisition opportunities throughout the united states and potentially will compete with buckeye partners  semgroup and these other entities for new business or extensions of the existing services provided by our operating partnerships  creating actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of our general partner 
in addition  effective january  it appears that an affiliate of semgroup has become a significant customer of ours  and because our distributions have exceeded target levels as specified in our partnership agreement  our general partner receives increasing percentages of our distributions 
distributions to our general partner above the highest target level are at 
as the owner of our general partner  mmh indirectly benefits from these distributions 
through ownership of the class b common units of mmh  which total of the total ownership of mmh  certain executive officers of our general partner also indirectly benefit from these distributions 

index to financial statements in  distributions paid to our general partner totaled million 
in addition  during  mmh received distributions totaling million related to its common and subordinated units 
assuming we have sufficient available cash to continue to pay distributions on all of our outstanding units for four quarters at our current quarterly distribution level of per unit  our general partner would receive distributions of approximately million in on its combined general partner interest and incentive distributions 
additionally  mmh would receive million on the distribution related to its common and subordinated units 
in connection with our october acquisition of assets from shell  our partnership agreement was amended to reduce the incentive cash distributions to be paid to our general partner by million for absent this agreement  the total distribution and combined general partner interest and incentive distribution amounts noted above would be million higher 
the terms of our indemnification settlement agreement require williams to make payments to us over a period of several years  exposing us to significant credit risk 
in may  our general partner entered into an agreement with williams under which williams agreed to pay us million to release them from certain indemnification obligations to us 
we received million from williams on july  and expect to receive the remaining balance in annual installments of million  million and million in july of  and  respectively 
as of december   known liabilities that would have been covered by these indemnifications were million 
williams credit rating is below investment grade 
failure of williams to perform on its payment obligations under the settlement agreement would reduce our ability to meet our obligations and pay cash distributions 
restrictions contained in our debt instruments and the debt instruments of magellan pipeline may limit our financial flexibility 
we and our subsidiary  magellan pipeline  are subject to restrictions with respect to our debt that may limit our flexibility in structuring or refinancing existing or future debt and prevent us from engaging in certain beneficial transactions 
these restrictions include  among other provisions  the maintenance of certain financial ratios  as well as limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to grant liens  to sell assets or to repay existing debt without penalties 
these restrictions could result in higher costs of borrowing and impair our ability to generate additional cash 
the sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profit interests will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes 
since february  mmh has sold common units that represented an approximate interest in our capital and profits for tax purposes 
we will be considered to have been terminated for federal income tax purposes if the common units sold by mmh  together with all common units sold within a month period  represent a sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profits interests 
our termination for tax purposes would  among other things  result in a significant deferral of the depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income for the year in which the termination occurs 
our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our exemption from entity level taxation by states 
if the internal revenue service treats us as a corporation or we become subject to entity level taxation for state tax purposes  it would reduce the amount of cash we generate 
a partnership is not a taxable entity and incurs no federal income tax liability 
instead  each partner of a partnership is required to take into account his share of items of income  gain  loss and deduction of the partnership in computing his federal income tax liability 
the internal revenue code generally provides that a publicly traded partnership will be taxed as a corporation 
however  an exception  know as the qualifying income exception  exists with respect to publicly traded partnerships of which or more of the gross income for every taxable year consists of qualifying income 
qualifying income includes income derived from the transportation  storage and processing of crude oil  natural gas and products thereof and fertilizer 
if we fail to meet the qualifying income exception  we may be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 

index to financial statements the after tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
if we were classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our income at the corporate rate 
some or all of the distributions made to unitholders would be treated as dividend incomes  and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to unitholders 
treatment of us as a corporation would cause a material reduction in our anticipated cash flow due to federal and state taxes  which would reduce our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
because of widespread state budget deficits  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation even though they are treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes 
if any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity  the cash available to pay distributions would be reduced 
the partnership agreement provides that  if a law is enacted or an existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  then the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be decreased to reflect that impact on us 
rising short term interest rates could increase our financing costs and reduce the amount of cash we generate 
as of december   we had fixed rate debt of million outstanding  excluding the market value of associated interest rate swap agreements 
we have converted approximately million of this debt to floating rate debt using interest rate swap agreements 
as a result of these agreements  we have significant exposure to changes in short term interest rates 
rising short term rates could reduce the amount of cash we generate and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to market risk through changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
we do not have foreign exchange risks 
we have established policies to monitor and control these market risks 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
as of december   we had no variable interest debt outstanding  however  because of certain interest rate swap agreements discussed below  we are exposed to million of interest rate market risk 
if interest rates change by  our annual interest expense would change by million 
during may  we entered into four separate interest rate swap agreements to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of the magellan pipeline series b senior notes 
we have accounted for these interest rate hedges as fair value hedges 
the notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreements total million 
under the terms of the agreements  we receive the interest rate of the magellan pipeline series b senior notes and pay libor plus 
these hedges effectively convert million of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
the interest rate swap agreements began on may  and expire on october  payments settle in april and october of each year with libor set in arrears 
during october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of the million of senior notes due we have accounted for this interest rate hedge as fair value hedge 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement is million 
under the terms of the agreement  we receive the interest rate of the million senior notes and pay libor plus 
this hedge effectively converts million of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
the interest rate swap agreement began on october  and expires on october  payments settle in april and october of each year with libor set in arrears 
as of december   we had entered into futures contracts for the acquisition of approximately million barrels of petroleum products 
the notional value of these agreements  with maturity dates during the first quarter of  was approximately million
