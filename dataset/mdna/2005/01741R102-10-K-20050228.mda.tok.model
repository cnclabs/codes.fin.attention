item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations allegheny technologies incorporated ati uses innovative technologies to produce a wide range of specialty materials for global markets 
our specialty materials are produced in a variety of alloys and forms  and are selected for use in environments that demand materials having exceptional hardness  toughness  strength  resistance to heat  corrosion or abrasion  or a combination of these characteristics 
major end markets of our products include aerospace  construction and mining  chemical processing  oil and gas  automotive  electrical energy  food processing equipment and appliances  machine and cutting tools  transportation  medical  and defense industries 
unless the context requires otherwise  ati  we  our  us and similar terms refer to allegheny technologies incorporated and its subsidiaries 
certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements 
actual results or performance could differ materially from those encompassed within such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those described below 
overview was a year of transition and transformation for ati 
after incurring losses over the previous three years and the first quarter of  we generated profits for each of the last three quarters of  and a profit for the full year of million  or per share 
sales increased to billion for as higher base selling prices  the effect of raw material surcharges  and higher shipments for most of our major products resulted from improved business conditions in most of the major markets we serve 
demand for our stainless steel flat rolled products increased for due to the improvement in the us industrial economy  especially in most capital goods markets 
this improvement in demand and higher base prices for most of the products of our flat rolled products segment  along with our acquisition of certain manufacturing assets of j l specialty steel llc j l in mid  and the benefits of cost reductions  offset the negative effects of rapidly rising raw material costs on our last in  first out lifo inventory accounting methodology and higher energy costs  resulting in an operating profit for this segment of million for compared to an operating loss of million in sales for our high performance metals segment improved primarily due to improving demand from the aerospace and medical markets for our nickel based alloys and superalloys and titanium alloys  and continued strong demand for our exotic materials  especially from the government and chemical processing markets 
operating profit for the high performance metals segment improved to million  due primarily to the improved pricing and increased shipments resulting from the increase in demand and the benefits from our cost reduction efforts  partially offset by the impact on our lifo inventory accounting methodology from rising raw material costs 
results for our engineered products segment also improved  as sales increased and operating profit increased to million due to improved demand from the oil and gas  construction and transportation markets  plus the benefits from our cost reduction actions 
while segment profitability improved significantly in  operating results were negatively impacted by higher raw material costs which resulted in lifo inventory valuation reserve charges of million  and higher energy costs of million  which partially offset the benefits of million in cost reductions and million of lower retirement benefit expense 
retirement benefit expenses decreased in to million primarily as a result of higher than expected returns on pension assets during  and actions taken in the second quarter to control retiree medical costs  partially offset by the use of a lower discount rate assumption for determining benefit plan liabilities 
during  our goals were to return our stainless steel business to profitability  and to continue to focus on enhancing our leading market positions  reducing costs  and improving our balance sheet 
we were successful in each of these areas 
our accomplishments during from these important efforts included o in june  we acquired substantially all of the stainless steel manufacturing assets of j l specialty steel llc for million  which represented the cost of this business net working capital  including the assumption of certain current liabilities  and which is subject to final adjustment 
the acquisition was completed for a million cash payment at closing with the balance financed by the seller 
these facilities were successfully integrated into our allegheny ludlum operations in the second half of in connection with the acquisition  a new progressive labor agreement was negotiated with united steelworkers of america uswa  which represents employees at our allegheny ludlum operations and at the acquired operations 
the new progressive labor agreement significantly improves the productivity and cost structure of our flat rolled products business 
o we achieved million in gross cost reductions  before the effects of inflation  exceeding our goal of million 
a significant portion of these cost reductions resulted from our continuing efforts to streamline processes and improve productivity 
o we completed two major strategic capital investments  both of which began in the second of two new electric arc furnaces for our flat rolled products melt shop located in brackenridge  pa began operation in september with the first furnace having begun operation in november the second project was a major upgrade and expansion of our high performance metals long products rolling mill facility located in richburg  sc  which began production in mid we believe these projects provide state of the art operating capabilities  increased efficiencies  lower operating costs  and expanded capacity 
o we realized continued success in implementing the ati business system  which is driving lean manufacturing throughout our operations 
in addition to the gross cost reductions discussed above and the improved safety performance discussed below  another result of our ati business system efforts was a significant improvement in managed working capital 
we define managed working capital as accounts receivable and gross inventories less accounts payable 
at december   managed working capital was of annualized sales compared to and of annualized sales at and year ends  respectively 
o we continued to realize significant improvement in safety 
as a result of our continuing focus on and commitment to safety  in  our osha total recordable incident rate improved by and our lost time case rate improved by  both compared to o we have strengthened our balance sheet 
in addition to returning ati to profitability in  in july we completed the sale of million shares of our common stock in a public offering and received million in net proceeds 
we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to enhance our abilities to make growth oriented investments  including capital investments and acquisitions that we believe will offer attractive returns 
we also intend to use a portion of the net proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our outstanding liabilities  which may include making voluntary contributions to our us defined benefit trust or the repayment or repurchase of our long term debt securities 
in september  we executed a portion of our strategy by making a voluntary contribution of million to our us defined benefit pension plan 
o we reduced our other postretirement benefit liability by approximately million  or  as a result efforts to control costs by capping ati s share of retiree medical costs and by capping and eventually eliminating these benefits for certain non collectively bargained employees 
as a result of these accomplishments  we believe that ati should benefit from improving business conditions in as we begin the year  most of our end markets remain strong and we expect to be a year of revenue growth and accelerating profitability 
sales are expected to grow in  compared to  due to the full year impact of significantly improved prices and higher volumes  especially in our flat rolled products and high performance metals segments 
we remain encouraged by the aerospace market build forecasts in terms of both the number and size of aircraft  as well as increased high performance metal content 
we expect a full year of benefits in from the strategic assets added in  principally the stainless steel melt shop and finishing operations in midland  pa and louisville  oh acquired in june  the upgraded brackenridge  pa stainless steel melt shop completed in september  and the expanded high performance metals long products rolling mill in richburg  sc  which began production in mid for  capital expenditures are expected to be between and million 
we are committed to improving operating performance through the ati business system 
we have established a cost reduction goal of approximately million  before the effects of inflation 
we also expect to continue to benefit from synergies and cost reductions from the j l asset acquisition and the new labor agreement in our flat rolled products business 
finally  retirement benefit expense is projected to be approximately million lower in than in  primarily as a result of actions taken in to control retiree medical costs 
acquisition of j l specialty steel llc assets on june   we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of j l specialty steel llc  a producer of flat rolled stainless steel products with operations in midland  pennsylvania and louisville  ohio  for million in total consideration  including the assumption of certain current liabilities 
the purchase price included million cash paid at closing  the issuance to the seller of a non interest bearing million promissory note payable on june   and the issuance to the seller of a promissory note in the principal amount of million  which is subject to final adjustment  and secured by the property  plant and equipment acquired  payable in installments in through  which bears interest at a london inter bank offered rate plus a margin  with a maximum interest rate of 
in connection with the j l asset acquisition  we reached a new labor agreement with the uswa  which represents employees at allegheny ludlum and at the former j l facilities 
the new agreement provides for a workforce restructuring through which we expect to achieve significant productivity improvements 
through a reduction in the number of job classifications and the implementation of flexible work rules  employees are being given broader responsibilities and the opportunity to become more involved in the business 
the number of production and maintenance employees at the pre acquisition allegheny ludlum facilities is being reduced by employees  or approximately  through an early retirement program over two and a half years pursuant to which the employees are being offered transition incentives 
approximately of these retirements occurred in second half of  with over of these retirements to be effective by the end of  and of these retirements to be effective by june with the addition of the j l assets  we estimate that our allegheny ludlum operations will be capable of annual shipments in excess of  tons of flat rolled specialty metals with approximately  production and maintenance employees 
by comparison  allegheny ludlum shipped  tons of these metals in with over  production and maintenance employees 
the acquisition of the j l assets and the negotiation of the new progressive labor agreement with the uswa are expected to improve the performance of our allegheny ludlum business 
we expect the new labor agreement  combined with the integration of the former j l operations  to generate annual cost structure improvements relative to the combined performance of the former j l and pre acquisition allegheny ludlum operations of approximately million when workforce restructuring and synergies are fully implemented in the second half of we anticipate these cost structure improvements to come from reduced labor costs  operating synergies  improved product mix  and reduced fixed costs 
in the aggregate  we expect these initiatives to result in a competitive cost structure for our flat rolled stainless steel business 
during the second half of  the former j l operations were successfully integrated into allegheny ludlum with the improvement in cost structure realized to date reflected in our operating results 
going forward the cost savings associated with the former j l operations that have yet to be realized  such as further reductions in labor costs associated with the contractual reduction in the size of the workforce and additional operating and procurement synergies  will be included as part of our continuing overall cost reduction programs 
results of operations sales were billion in  billion in and billion in international sales represented approximately of total sales and of total sales for each of and operating profit was million in  million in  and million in our measure of operating profit  which we use to analyze the performance and results of our business segments  excludes income taxes  corporate expenses  net interest expense  curtailment gain  management transition and restructuring costs  other costs net of gains on asset sales  and retirement benefit expense 
we believe operating profit  as defined  provides an appropriate measure of controllable operating results at the business segment level 
income before tax was million in compared to loss before tax of million and million for and  respectively 
income before income tax for included a curtailment gain  net of restructuring charges  of million 
loss before tax included restructuring charges and litigation expense of million in  and restructuring charges of million in a severe decline in the equity markets in through and lower discount rate assumptions for determining benefit plan liabilities resulted in retirement benefit expenses of million in  million in and million for net income was million for compared to losses  before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  of million and million for and  respectively 
results for do not include an income tax provision or benefit for current or deferred taxes primarily as a result of the continuing uncertainty regarding full utilization of our net deferred tax assets and available operating loss carryforwards 
net income for included a curtailment gain  net of restructuring costs of million  related to the elimination of retiree medical benefits for certain non collectively bargained employees beginning in  and costs associated with the acquisition of the j l assets and the new labor agreement 
the net loss for included a million charge for a valuation allowance on the majority of our net deferred tax assets  pretax restructuring charges of million relating to asset impairments in the flat rolled products segment and workforce reductions across all operating segments and the corporate office  and million for litigation expense 
as a result of recording the deferred tax valuation allowance  results for include an income tax provision of million  whereas pretax losses were reduced by income tax benefits of million 
results for included charges of million related to the indefinite idling of our massillon  oh stainless steel plate facility in the flat rolled products segment  and workforce reductions 
we operate in three business segments flat rolled products  high performance metals and engineered products 
these segments represented the following percentages of our total revenues for the years indicated flat rolled products high performance metals engineered products information with respect to our business segments is presented below and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
flat rolled products in millions change change sales to external customers    operating income loss n m operating income loss as a percentage of sales international sales as a percentage of sales n m not meaningful our flat rolled products segment produces  converts and distributes stainless steel  nickel based alloys  and titanium and titanium based alloys  in a variety of product forms including plate  sheet  strip  engineered strip  and precision rolled strip r products  as well as silicon electrical steel sheet  and tool steels 
the major end markets for our flat rolled products are construction and mining  automotive  electrical energy  food processing equipment and appliances  machine and cutting tools  chemical processing  oil and gas  electronics  communication equipment and computers 
the operations in this segment are allegheny ludlum  our interest in the chinese joint venture company known as shanghai stal precision stainless steel company limited stal  and our interest in the industrial titanium joint venture known as uniti llc 
the remaining interest in stal is owned by the baosteel group  a state authorized investment company whose equity securities are publicly traded in the people s republic of china 
the financial results of stal are consolidated into the segment s operating results with the interest of our minority partner recognized in the statement of operations as other income or expense 
the remaining interest in uniti llc is held by vsmpo avisma  a russian producer of titanium  aluminum  and specialty steel products 
we account for the results of the uniti joint venture using the equity method since we do not have a controlling interest 
on june   we acquired substantially all of the assets of j l specialty steel llc  including facilities located in midland  pa and louisville  oh 
operating results include the acquired j l operations from the date of acquisition 
however since the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  results did not include any operating profit on sales of the approximately million of the j l inventory on hand at the acquisition date 
compared to sales for the flat rolled products segment for were  million  or higher than  which was due primarily to improved demand  higher base selling prices  higher raw material surcharges  and higher shipments resulting from the midland  pa and louisville  oh facilities acquired in june comparative information on the segment s products for the years ended december  and was for the years ended december  change volume finished tons total flat rolled products   commodity   high value   average prices per finished ton total flat rolled products   commodity   high value   finished tons shipped in increased by to  tons compared to shipments of  tons for the average transaction prices to customers  which includes the effect of higher raw material surcharges and higher base selling prices  increased by to  per ton in shipments of commodity products including stainless steel hot roll and cold roll sheet  stainless steel plate and silicon electrical steel  among other products increased and average transaction prices for these products increased 
the increase in shipments was primarily attributable to improving demand from the residential construction and remodeling markets  and capital goods markets such as chemical processing  oil and gas  and power generation markets  and the benefit of additional capacity resulting from the midland  pa and louisville  oh facilities acquired in june demand remained good from the automotive and appliance markets 
the increase in average transaction prices was primarily due to higher base selling prices and higher raw material surcharges 
the majority of our stainless steel products are sold at prices that include surcharges for raw materials such as iron  nickel  chromium  and molybdenum  including purchased scrap  which are required to manufacture our products 
linegraph depicting nickel prices nickel prices lb source london metal exchange linegraph depicting chromium prices chromium prices lb source platts metals week linegraph depicting molybdenum oxide prices molybdenum oxide prices lb source platts metals week linegraph depicting iron scrap prices iron scrap prices lb the cost of these raw materials increased significantly in  which resulted in substantially higher raw material surcharges 
in addition  a raw material surcharge for iron scrap was instituted in the first half of as a result of the cost of iron scrap increasing approximately in compared to average cost for the average base selling price in december for type commodity stainless steel cold rolled sheet increased approximately compared to the same period in  consumption in the us of stainless steel strip  sheet and plate products increased approximately  compared to consumption  according to the specialty steel institute of north america ssina 
our high value product shipments in the segment including strip  precision rolled strip  super stainless steel  nickel alloy and titanium products increased  and average transaction prices for high value products increased 
certain of these high value products are used in the consumer durables and capital goods markets  both of which benefited from an improving us economy in the markets we serve  which positively affected shipments and base selling prices 
in addition  shipments of precision rolled strip products increased in europe and asia due primarily to strong demand from the automotive and electronics markets  partially aided by the weaker us currency 

bar chart 
apparent domestic consumption stainless steel sheet and strip millions of tons source ssina as a result of the improving business conditions  operating income increased to million for compared to an operating loss of million in the period 
the benefits of increased shipment volumes  higher base selling prices  and cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs 
during the average cost of our raw materials in our flat rolled products segment increased approximately 
for  we incurred approximately million of expense for these cost increases  including lifo inventory charges of million and cost increases of million for certain raw materials which were not subject to surcharges for the full year 
in addition  natural gas and electricity costs for were approximately million higher than we continued to aggressively reduce costs and streamline our operations 
in  we achieved gross cost reductions  before the effects of inflation  of million in our flat rolled products segment 
major areas of cost reductions  before the effects of inflation  included million from operating efficiencies  million from procurement  million from lower compensation and fringe benefit expenses  and million from other fixed cost savings 
during the second half of  we began reducing our hourly workforce at our allegheny ludlum plants by employees  which represented approximately of the pre j l acquisition hourly workforce  in accordance with the new labor agreement with the uswa 
this agreement resulted in a pension termination benefits charge of million in the second quarter under this agreement  hourly employees retired in with employees contractually scheduled to retire in through the first half of the pension termination benefits charge is presented in restructuring costs on the statement of operations and is not included in the results for the segment 
we continued to invest to enhance our flat rolled specialty metals capabilities  increase efficiencies and reduce costs 
our strategic capital investment to upgrade the brackenridge  pa melt shop  which commenced in and cost approximately million  was successfully completed 
the first of the two new electric arc furnaces began operation in november and the second furnace began operation in september cost savings from this capital investment are estimated to be over million annually 
compared to sales for the flat rolled products segment for were  million  essentially the same as  which was due primarily to the effect of higher raw material surcharges offsetting lower volumes and reduced base selling prices 
weak demand and base pricing for products of the flat rolled products segment  especially commodity stainless steel  which persisted for most of  plus the negative effects of rapidly rising raw material costs and higher energy costs resulted in an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million in finished tons shipped in declined by to  tons compared to shipments of  tons for the average transaction prices to customers increased by to  per ton in due primarily to higher raw materials surcharges  which offset a decline in average base selling prices  which exclude the effect of surcharges 
shipments of commodity products including stainless steel hot roll and cold roll sheet  stainless steel plate and silicon electrical steel  among other products decreased while average prices for these products increased 
the decline in shipments was primarily attributable to continued depressed demand for commodity stainless steel sheet and plate due to the continued weakness in the us industrial economy  especially in the non residential construction and most capital goods markets 
the increase in average transaction prices was primarily due to higher raw material surcharges  principally for nickel and nickel bearing scrap 
commodity stainless steel base selling prices  which exclude surcharges  declined in compared to during the same period  consumption in the us of stainless steel strip  sheet and plate products was flat according to the specialty steel institute of north america ssina 
high value product shipments in the segment including strip  precision rolled strip r  super stainless steel  nickel alloy and titanium products decreased  while average transaction prices for high value products were flat 
increased shipments of precision rolled strip r products in europe and asia were partially offset by the overall decline in shipments of other high value products 
certain of these high value products are used in the consumer durables and capital goods markets  both of which continued to be impacted by the weak us economy in the markets we serve  which negatively affected shipments 
operating results for were adversely affected by higher raw material costs  which increased significantly in  especially during the second half of the year 
for example  the cost of nickel  a major raw material in the production of many stainless steel alloys  increased in from an average cost of per pound for the month of december to an average cost of per pound for december  as priced on the london metals exchange 
while we were able to offset a significant portion of the increase through raw material surcharges in the pricing of our products  these higher costs had a negative effect on cost of sales as a result of our lifo inventory accounting methodology 
for  we incurred approximately million of expense for these cost increases  including lifo inventory charges of million and cost increases of million for certain raw materials which were not subject to our surcharges 
in addition  natural gas and electricity costs for were approximately million higher than in  we achieved gross cost reductions  before the effects of inflation  of million 
major areas of cost reductions  before the effects of inflation  included million from operating efficiencies  million from procurement  million from lower compensation and fringe benefit expenses  and million from reduced depreciation expense and other fixed cost savings 
during  we implemented workforce reductions of approximately salaried employees representing approximately of the salaried workforce 
these workforce reductions were substantially complete by the end of and resulted in a pretax severance charge of million in in addition  we indefinitely idled our washington flat rolled coil facility located in washington  pa and recorded an asset impairment charge related to the remaining assets located at houston  pa reflecting projected utilization 
these actions resulted in a total pretax  non cash asset impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter 
these expenses are presented as restructuring costs on the statement of operations and are not included in the results for the segment

backlog of confirmed orders for the segment increased to approximately million at december   compared to approximately million at december  operating profit for and was adversely affected by higher raw material costs  which increased significantly in the past two years 
these higher costs had a negative effect on cost of sales as a result of our lifo inventory accounting methodology  resulting in million of expense for  compared to million of lifo expense in we continued to aggressively reduce costs in gross cost reductions for  before the effects of inflation  totaled approximately million 
major areas of cost reductions  before the effects of inflation  included million from operating efficiencies  million from procurement  and million from salaried and hourly labor cost savings 
we continued to invest to enhance our specialty metals capabilities  increase efficiencies and reduce costs 
our strategic capital investment to enhance the capabilities of our long products rolling mill facility located in richburg  sc  which cost approximately million  began construction in and commenced production in the second quarter of the project includes mutual conversion agreements with outokumpu oyj s us subsidiary  outokumpu stainless  giving us access to process our products at outokumpu stainless facility and outokumpu stainless access to process their stainless steel long products at our richburg facility 
compared to sales for the high performance metals segment increased to million in primarily due to strong demand for our exotic materials  especially for the government and chemical processing markets  which offset continued weakness in the commercial aerospace and land based turbine power generation markets 
however  operating profit for the high performance metals segment declined to million because of lower demand and prices for nickel based alloys and superalloys  specialty steel alloys and titanium based alloys  which represent approximately of the segment s sales 
in addition  rising raw material costs offset cost reduction efforts 
shipments of nickel based and specialty steel alloys decreased  while average prices increased due primarily to product mix 
titanium mill products shipments decreased and average prices decreased 
shipments for exotic alloys increased and average prices increased 
backlog of confirmed orders for the segment was approximately million at december   compared to approximately million at december  operating profit for was adversely affected by higher raw material costs  which increased significantly in  especially during the second half of the year 
these higher costs had a negative effect on cost of sales as a result of our lifo inventory accounting methodology  resulting in million of expense for  compared to million of lifo income in operating profit in was adversely impacted by the effects of a seven month labor strike settled in march at our wah chang operation  which produces our exotic alloys 
gross cost reductions  before the effects of inflation  for totaled approximately million 
major areas of cost reductions  before the effects of inflation  included million from operating efficiencies  million from procurement  and million from hourly and salary labor cost savings 
during  we implemented further workforce reductions  which affected approximately employees  or of the salaried workforce 
in connection with these reductions  which were substantially completed by the end of the year  we recorded charges of million for the related severance costs 
these expenses are presented as restructuring costs on the statement of operations and are not included in the results for the segment 
engineered products in millions change change sales to external customers operating profit operating profit as a percentage of sales international sales as a percentage of sales our engineered products segment includes the production of tungsten powder  tungsten heavy alloys  tungsten carbide materials and carbide cutting tools 
the segment also produces carbon alloy steel impression die forgings  and large grey and ductile iron castings  and provides precision metals processing services 
the operations in this segment are metalworking products  portland forge  casting service and rome metals 
the major markets served by our products of the engineered products segment include a wide variety of industrial markets including automotive  chemical processing  oil and gas  machine and cutting tools  construction and mining  aerospace  transportation  and wind power generation 
compared to sales for the engineered products segment in increased  to million and operating profit increased  to million compared to demand for our tungsten products was strong from general manufacturing  and the oil and gas and medical markets 
demand improved for forgings from the class truck  and construction and mining markets 
demand for castings was strong from the transportation and wind energy markets 
the improvement in segment operating profit was primarily due to higher sales volumes  improved pricing  and the impact of cost reductions  which totaled million in the improvement in profitability was partially offset by higher raw material costs  which resulted in a lifo inventory valuation reserve charge of million in  compared to a charge of million in compared to sales for the engineered products segment increased  to million in  compared to  and operating profit increased  to million 
demand for our tungsten products from the oil and gas  medical and automotive markets improved during demand also improved for forgings and castings 
segment operating profit improved primarily due to higher sales and the impact of cost reductions  which totaled million in in the second half of  we announced an additional restructuring of the european operations of metalworking products 
restructuring charges of approximately million associated with this consolidation are presented as restructuring costs on the statement of operations and are not included in segment results 
corporate expenses corporate expenses were million in compared to million in  and million in cost controls and reductions in the number of corporate employees that were implemented over this period were offset in by increased compensation expense and the costs of complying with sarbanes oxley regulations 
a significant portion of the increase in compensation expense is non cash and is associated with our long term  performance based stock compensation plans 
achievement under these plans is marked to market for stock price changes  which resulted in substantially higher expense in due to the significant increase in our stock price during the year  and our stock performance relative to a group of our industry peers 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  was million for compared to million for and million for the effect of receive fixed  pay floating interest rate swap contracts of million  related to our million  year notes issued in december  decreased interest expense by million in  million in and million in  compared to the fixed interest expense of the notes

interest expense is presented net of interest income of million for  million for and million for the increase in interest income for primarily relates to interest on settlements of prior years tax liabilities 
curtailment gain and restructuring costs we recorded a curtailment gain  net of restructuring costs  of million in and restructuring costs of million  and million in and  respectively 
in  the curtailment gain  net of restructuring costs  of million  includes the million curtailment and settlement gain and the million pension termination benefit charge discussed in retirement benefit expense  below  and million of restructuring charges 
the restructuring charges related to the new labor agreement at our allegheny ludlum operations  and the j l asset acquisition  and included labor agreement costs of million  severance costs of million related to approximately salaried employees  and million for asset impairment charges for redundant equipment following the j l asset acquisition 
in  we recorded restructuring charges of million  including million for impairment of long lived assets in the flat rolled products segment  million for workforce reductions across all business segments and the corporate office  and million for facility closure charges including present valued lease termination costs  net of forecasted sublease rental income  at the corporate office 
in the fourth quarter  based on existing and projected operating levels at our remaining operations in houston  pa  and at our washington flat roll coil facility located in washington  pa  we determined that the net book values of these facilities were in excess of their estimated fair market values based on expected future cash flows 
charges for the houston facility and the washington flat roll coil facility were recorded to write down the net book values of these facilities to their estimated fair market values 
these asset impairment charges did not impact current operations at these facilities 
the workforce reductions affected approximately employees across all segments and the corporate office 
approximately million of the severance charges was paid from the company s pension plan  and at december   approximately million of the workforce reduction and facility closure charges are future cash costs that will be paid over the next nine years 
cash to meet these obligations is expected to be generated from one or more of the following sources internally generated funds from operations  current cash on hand  or borrowings under existing credit lines 
in  we recorded total charges of million related to the indefinite idling of our massillon  oh stainless steel plate facility due to continuing poor demand for wide continuous mill plate products  and further workforce reductions across all of our operations 
the massillon  oh stainless steel plate facility was indefinitely idled in the fourth quarter  and resulted in a pretax non cash asset impairment charge of million  representing the excess of the book value of the facility over its estimated fair market value 
in addition  during the second half of  and in light of the continued weak demand in the markets we serve  we announced workforce reductions of approximately employees 
these workforce reductions were substantially complete by the end of the first half of  and resulted in a pretax  primarily cash  severance charge of million  net of a retirement benefits curtailment gain 
these expenses were presented as restructuring costs on the statement of operations and were not included in segment results

other expenses  net of gains on asset sales other expenses  net of gains on asset sales  includes charges incurred in connection with closed operations  pretax gains and losses on the sale of surplus real estate  non strategic investments and other assets  operating results from equity method investees  minority interest and other non operating income or expense 
these items are presented primarily in selling and administrative expenses  and in other income expense in the statement of operations and resulted in other income of million in  and net charges of million and million in and  respectively 
in  charges for closed companies related to legal  environmental  insurance and other matters were approximately million higher than in these charges include million related to litigation with the san diego unified port district  as more fully described in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  and which is included in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations  and changes in our estimates of our liability for environmental closure costs and for liabilities under retrospectively rated insurance programs 
in  we recognized a pretax charge of million for our approximate share of the net losses in new piper aircraft new piper  and for the write off of the carrying value of this investment 
retirement benefit expense retirement benefit expenses  which primarily include pension and postretirement medical benefits  declined million in primarily as a result of higher than expected returns on pension assets during  and actions taken in the second quarter to control retiree medical costs  partially offset by the use of a lower discount rate assumption for determining benefit plan liabilities 
retirement benefit expense had increased significantly over the previous three years principally due to lower pension investments as a result of severe declines in the equity markets in through  and higher benefit liabilities from long term labor contracts negotiated in retirement benefit expense  excluding the effect of curtailment gains and termination benefit charges  was million for  million for and million for retirement benefit expenses have adversely affected both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses 
retirement benefit expense included in cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses for the years ended  and was as follows in millions cost of sales selling and administrative expenses total retirement benefit expense the retirement benefit expense discussed above does not include the effects of the million curtailment and settlement gain related to the elimination of retiree medical benefits for certain non collectively bargained employees beginning in  nor does this expense include the million charge related to the transition assistance program tap incentives associated with the new labor agreement at allegheny ludlum  which will be paid from our us defined benefit pension plan 
additionally  the retirement benefit expense recognized through december  includes approximately million of the expected million favorable impact on our postretirement medical expense from the enactment of the federal medicare prescription drug benefit program in december the reduction in postretirement expense from this program will be recognized over a number of years 
retirement benefit expenses for are expected to be approximately million  with effects on cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses similar to the percentages in the pension expense component is expected to decline to approximately million pretax for from million for as actual returns on pension assets in were higher than expected  partially offset by a lower assumed discount rate to value pension benefit liabilities 
the postretirement medical expense component is expected to decline to approximately million for from million for primarily as a result of actions taken in the second quarter to control certain retiree medical costs partially offset by a lower assumed discount rate to value benefit liabilities 
income taxes results of operations for do not include an income tax provision or benefit for current or deferred taxes primarily as a result of the continuing uncertainty regarding full utilization of our net deferred tax asset and available operating loss carryforwards 
in the fourth quarter we recorded a million valuation allowance for the majority of our net deferred tax asset  based upon the results of our quarterly evaluation concerning the estimated probability that the net deferred tax asset would be realizable in light of our recent history of annual reported losses 
this charge did not affect cash and does not affect our ability to utilize any of our deferred tax assets on future tax returns 
our income tax provision benefit for and was million and million  respectively 
in  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  in income tax refunds related to carrying back the previous year s taxable loss to earlier years in which we had paid taxes 
under current tax laws we are substantially unable to carryback any current year or future tax losses to prior periods to obtain cash refunds of taxes paid during those periods 
current year federal tax losses  if any  can be carried forward for up to years and applied against taxes owed in those future years 
as of december   we had a us federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which equates to a us federal tax benefit of approximately million 
this carryforward is available to offset any taxable income in  or in future periods through deferred taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes  and differences between the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax bases 
deferred income taxes represent future tax benefits or costs to be recognized when those temporary differences reverse 
at december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
a significant portion of our deferred tax assets  prior to the valuation allowance  relates to postretirement employee benefit obligations  which have been recorded in the accompanying financial statements but which are not recognized for income tax reporting purposes until the benefits are paid 
these benefit payments are expected to occur over an extended period of years 
no valuation allowance was required on million of net deferred tax assets based upon our ability to utilize these assets within the carryback  carryforward period  including consideration of tax planning strategies that we would undertake to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unutilized 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset until a realization event occurs to support the reversal of all or a portion of the reserve 
as a result  future tax provisions or benefits are expected to be recognized only when taxable income exceeds net operating loss carryforwards resulting in cash tax payments  or when tax losses are recoverable as cash refunds 
financial condition and liquidity we believe that internally generated funds  current cash on hand and available borrowings under existing secured credit lines will be adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs 
we did not borrow funds under our domestic secured credit facility during or however  a portion of this secured credit facility is utilized to support letters of credit 
our ability to access the credit markets in the future to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be influenced by our credit rating 
as of december   standard poor s ratings services corporate credit rating for our company was bb with a stable outlook and our senior unsecured debt was rated b 
as of december   moody s investor service s senior implied rating for our company was b with a stable outlook  and senior unsecured rating was b changes in our credit rating do not impact our access to  or cost of  our existing credit facilities 
we have no off balance sheet financing relationships with variable interest or structured finance entities 
common stock offering on july   we completed the sale of million shares of our common stock in a public offering  including million shares to cover overallotments  and received million in net proceeds 
the million shares were reissued from treasury stock 
we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to enhance our abilities to make growth oriented investments  including capital investments and acquisitions that we believe will offer attractive returns 
we also intend to use a portion of the net proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our outstanding liabilities  which may include making voluntary contributions to our us defined benefit trust or the repayment or repurchase of our long term debt securities 
we may also use a portion of the net proceeds for other general corporate purposes 
in september  we executed a portion of our strategy by making a voluntary contribution of million to our us defined benefit plan to improve the funded position of our us defined benefit pension plan 
based on current actuarial studies  we do not expect to be required to make cash contributions to this defined benefit pension plan during the next several years 
however  we may elect  depending upon the investment performance of the pension plan assets and other factors  to make additional voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the future 
managed working capital millions managed working capital as of sales cash flow and working capital in  cash generated by operations of million  proceeds from sale of common stock of million  proceeds from asset sales of million  and proceeds from exercises of stock options of million  were used to invest million in capital equipment  approximately half of which was for two major capital projects in the flat rolled products and high performance metals segments  fund a million voluntary contribution to our us pension plan  pay million of the purchase price for the j l assets  repay debt of million  pay dividends of million  and increase cash balances by million  to million at december  in  cash generated from operations of million  proceeds from asset sales of million and proceeds from financing activities of million  were used to invest in capital equipment  primarily for two major projects in the flat rolled products and high performance metals segments  pay dividends of million  and increase cash balances by million  to million at december  the impact of improved operating results in on cash flow from operations was offset by continuing investment in managed working capital to support the higher business levels and the impact of higher raw material costs 
as part of managing the liquidity of the business  we focus on controlling inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
in measuring performance in controlling this managed working capital  we exclude the effects of the lifo inventory valuation reserves  excess and obsolete inventory reserves  and reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable which  due to their nature  are managed separately 
during  managed working capital  which we define as gross inventory plus accounts receivable less accounts payable  increased by million  excluding working capital acquired as part of the j l asset acquisition 
this increase in managed working capital resulted from a million increase in accounts receivable due to a higher level of sales in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of  and a million increase in inventory mostly as a result of higher raw material costs and increased business volumes  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable 
most of the increase in raw materials is expected to be recovered through surcharge and index pricing mechanisms 
while the absolute amount of managed working capital employed in the business has increased over the past three years  managed working capital as a percent of annualized sales has declined to in from in  and in as we have continued to focus on being more efficient in operating our businesses 
while inventory and accounts receivable balances increased during  gross inventory turns  which exclude the effect of lifo inventory valuation reserves  and days sales outstanding  which measures actual collection timing for accounts receivable both have improved over the past two years 
the components of managed working capital were as follows december  december  december  in millions accounts receivable inventory accounts payable subtotal allowance for doubtful accounts lifo reserve corporate and other managed working capital annualized prior months sales    managed working capital as a of sales capital expenditures for were million compared to million in  as we completed our two major strategic capital projects begun in two new electric arc furnaces at our flat rolled products melt shop located in brackenridge  pa  and investments to enhance the capabilities at our high performance metals long products rolling mill facility located in richburg  sc 
the second electric arc furnace in the flat rolled products segment commenced operations in the third quarter  with the first new furnace having commenced production in fourth quarter 
the high performance metals long products facility commenced operations in the second quarter 
capital expenditures in were million as we controlled our investment spending due to the uncertain economy and to preserve liquidity 
capital expenditures for are expected to be between and million 
debt total debt outstanding increased million  to million at december   from million at december  the increase was primarily related to million in seller financing for the j l asset acquisition  partially offset by net debt repayments primarily for industrial revenue bonds 
in managing our overall capital structure  one of the measures on which we focus is net debt to total capitalization  which is the percentage of our debt to our total invested and borrowed capital 
in determining this measure  debt and total capitalization are net of cash on hand which may be available to reduce borrowings 
our net debt to total capitalization ratio improved to at december  from at the end of the lower ratio results primarily from an increase in cash on hand and stockholders equity resulting from the common stock offering and the improvement in results of operations  partially offset by an increase in outstanding debt due primarily to the seller financing for the j l asset acquisition 
december  december  in millions total debt less cash net debt net debt total stockholders equity total capital net debt to capital ratio interest rate swap contracts are used from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
in  we entered into interest rate swap contracts with respect to a million notional amount related to our notes due notes  which involved the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the contracts without an exchange of the underlying principal amount 
these receive fixed  pay floating arrangements were designated as fair value hedges  and effectively converted million of the notes to variable rate debt 
as a result  changes in the fair value of the swap contracts and the notional amount of the underlying fixed rate debt are recognized in the statement of operations 
in  we terminated the majority of these interest rate swap contracts and received million in cash 
subsequent to the interest rate swap terminations  in we entered into new receive fixed  pay floating interest rate swap arrangements related to the notes which re established  in total  a million notional amount that effectively converted this portion of the notes to variable rate debt 
in the third quarter in light of the prospect of increasing short term interest rates  we terminated all remaining interest rate swap contracts still outstanding  and realized net cash proceeds of million 
these gains on settlement realized in and remain a component of the reported balance of the notes  and are ratably recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the notes  which is approximately seven years 
at december   the deferred settlement gain was million 
the result of the receive fixed  pay floating arrangements was a decrease in interest expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  compared to the fixed interest expense of the ten year notes 
during the second quarter  we entered into a million four year senior secured domestic revolving credit facility the secured credit facility or the facility  which was amended on april  the facility  which replaced a million unsecured facility  is secured by all accounts receivable and inventory of our us operations  and includes capacity for up to million in letters of credit 
as of december   there had been no borrowings made under either the secured credit facility or the former unsecured credit facility since the beginning of outstanding letters of credit issued under the secured credit facility were approximately million at december  the secured credit facility limits capital expenditures  investments and acquisitions of businesses  new indebtedness  asset divestitures  payment of dividends  and common stock repurchases which we may incur or undertake during the term of the facility without obtaining permission of the lending group 
at december   the amount of dividends we could pay without the consent of the lending group was approximately million 
in addition  the secured credit facility contains a financial covenant  which is not measured unless our undrawn availability under the facility is less than million 
this financial covenant  when measured  requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to fixed charges of at least to ebitda is adjusted for non cash items such as income loss on investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting  non cash pension expense income  and that portion of retiree medical and life insurance expenses paid from our veba trust 
ebitda is reduced by capital expenditures  as defined in the facility  and cash taxes paid  and increased for cash tax refunds 
fixed charges include gross interest expense  dividends paid and scheduled debt payments 
at december   our undrawn availability under the facility  which is calculated including outstanding letters of credit  other uses of credit and domestic cash on hand  was million  and the amount that we could borrow at that date prior to requiring the application of a financial covenant test was million 
changes in our credit rating do not impact our access to  or cost of  our existing credit facilities

our purchase obligation as disclosed represents the estimated termination fees payable if we were to exit these contracts 
d drawn amounts are included in total debt

retirement benefits as of november   our measurement date for pension accounting  the value of the accumulated pension benefit obligation abo for our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the value of pension investments by approximately million 
a minimum pension liability was recognized in as a result of a severe decline in the equity markets from through  higher benefit liabilities from long term labor contracts negotiated in  and a lower assumed discount rate for valuing the pension liabilities 
accounting standards require that a minimum pension liability be recorded if the value of pension investments is less than the abo at the annual measurement date 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter  we recorded a charge against stockholders equity of million  net of deferred taxes  to write off our prepaid pension cost representing the previous overfunded portion of the pension plan  and to record a deferred pension asset for unamortized prior service cost relating to prior benefit enhancements 
in the fourth quarter of and  our adjustments of the minimum pension liability resulted in an increase to stockholders equity of million for and million for  presented as other comprehensive income loss 
the recognition of the minimum pension liability in  and the adjustments of the minimum pension liability in and do not affect our reported results of operations and do not have a cash impact 
in accordance with accounting standards  the full charge against stockholders equity would be reversed in subsequent years if the value of pension plan investments returns to a level that exceeds the abo as of a future annual measurement date 
as of the annual measurement date  the value of pension investments was billion and the abo was billion 
based upon current actuarial analyses and forecasts  the abo is projected to be approximately billion at the annual measurement date  assuming no changes in the discount rate used to value benefit obligations 
we were not required to make cash contributions to our us defined benefit pension plan for during the third quarter  we made a million voluntary contribution to this defined benefit pension plan to improve the plan s funded position 
based on current actuarial studies  we do not expect to be required to make cash contributions to our us defined benefit pension plan during the next several years 
however  a significant decline in the value of plan investments in the future or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding 
depending on the timing and amount  a requirement that we fund our defined benefit pension plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we may elect  depending upon investment performance of the pension plan assets and other factors  to make additional voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the future 
we fund certain retiree health care benefits for allegheny ludlum using investments held in a voluntary employee benefit association veba trust 
this allows us to recover a portion of the retiree medical costs 
in accordance with our labor agreements  during  and  we funded million  million and million  respectively  of retiree medical costs using the investments of the veba trust 
we may continue to fund certain retiree medical benefits utilizing the investments held in the veba if the value of these investments exceed million 
the value of the investments held in the veba was approximately million as of november  dividends we paid a quarterly dividend of per share of common stock during and on february   the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of per share of common stock 
the dividend will be paid on march   to stockholders of record at the close of business on march  while we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock  we cannot make assurances that in the future we will not reduce the amount of dividends paid  or stop paying dividends  on our common stock 
for example  in the fourth quarter  our board of directors substantially reduced the amount of our quarterly dividend from the levels we had been paying in previous quarters 
the declaration and payment of dividends  if any  and the amount of such dividends depends upon matters deemed relevant by our board of directors on a quarterly basis  such as our results of operations  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects  and any limitations imposed by law  credit agreements or senior securities  and other factors deemed relevant and appropriate 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires our management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue is recognized when title passes or as services are rendered 
we have no significant unusual sale arrangements with any of our customers 
we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states 
trade credit is extended based upon evaluations of each customer s ability to perform its obligations  which are updated periodically 
accounts receivable reserves are based upon an aging of accounts and a review for collectibility of specific accounts 
accounts receivable are presented net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of million at december  and million at december   which represented and  respectively  of total gross accounts receivable 
during  we made no increases for doubtful accounts and wrote off million of uncollectible accounts  which reduced the reserve 
during  we recognized expense of million to increase the reserve for doubtful accounts and wrote off million of uncollectible accounts  which reduced the reserve 
inventories at december   we had net inventory of million 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost last in  first out lifo  first in  first out fifo and average cost methods or market  less progress payments 
costs include direct material  direct labor and applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead  and other direct costs 
most of our inventory is valued utilizing the lifo costing methodology 
inventory of our non us operations is valued using average cost or fifo methods 
under the lifo inventory valuation method  changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these material and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle 
the prices for many of the raw materials we use have recently been extremely volatile  especially during when raw material prices rose rapidly  compared to since we value most of our inventory utilizing the lifo inventory costing methodology  a rapid rise in raw material costs has a negative effect on our operating results 
for example in  the effect of the increase in raw material costs on our lifo inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which was million higher than would have been recognized if we utilized the fifo methodology to value our inventory 
in a period of rising prices  cost of sales expense recognized under lifo is generally higher than the cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold 
conversely  in a period of declining raw material prices  cost of sales recognized under lifo is generally lower than cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold 
in the second quarter  we changed our method of calculating lifo inventories at our allegheny ludlum operations by reducing the overall number of company wide inventory pools from to eight  and by changing its calculation method for lifo from the double extension method to the link chain method 
we made the change in order to better match costs with revenues  to reflect the business structure of allegheny ludlum following the j l asset acquisition  to provide for a lifo adjustment more representative of allegheny ludlum s actual inflation on its inventories  and to conform lifo accounting methods with our other operations that use the lifo inventory method 
the cumulative effect of the change in methods and the pro forma effects of the change on prior years results of operations were not determinable 
the effect of the change on the results of operations for was not material 
we evaluate product lines on a quarterly basis to identify inventory values that exceed estimated net realizable value 
the calculation of a resulting reserve  if any  is recognized as an expense in the period that the need for the reserve is identified 
at december   no such reserves were required 
it is our general policy to write down to scrap value any inventory that is identified as obsolete and any inventory that has aged or has not moved in more than twelve months 
in some instances this criterion is up to twenty four months due to the longer manufacturing and distribution process for such products 
asset impairment we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets 
an impairment charge is recognized when the expected net undiscounted future cash flows from an asset s use including any proceeds from disposition are less than the asset s carrying value  and the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
changes in the expected use of a long lived asset group  and the financial performance of the long lived asset group and its operating segment  are evaluated as indicators of possible impairment 
future cash flow value may include appraisals for property  plant and equipment  land and improvements  future cash flow estimates from operating the long lived assets  and other operating considerations 
at december   we had million of goodwill on our balance sheet 
changes in the goodwill balance from are due to foreign currency translation 
of the total  million related to the flat rolled products segment  million related to the high performance metals segment  and million related to the engineered products segment 
goodwill is required to be reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this comparison reflects impairment  then the loss would be measured as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value 
implied fair value is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of all recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities 
we perform our annual evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment during the fourth quarter 
our evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment includes estimating the fair market value of each of the reporting units which have goodwill associated with their operations using discounted cash flow and multiples of cash earnings valuation techniques  plus valuation comparisons to recent public sale transactions of similar businesses  if any 
these valuation methods require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future operating results  cash flows including changes in working capital and capital expenditures  selling prices  profitability  and the cost of capital 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions used were reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
no goodwill impairment was determined to exist for the years ended december   or income taxes deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes  or differences between the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax bases 
deferred income taxes represent future tax benefits assets or costs liabilities to be recognized when those temporary differences reverse 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis whether  based on all available evidence  we believe that our deferred income tax assets will be realizable 
valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is probable more likely than not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the evaluation  as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  includes the consideration of all available evidence  both positive and negative  regarding historical operating results including recent years with reported losses  the estimated timing of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  and potential tax planning strategies which may be employed to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused 
future realization of deferred income tax assets ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback  carryforward period available under tax law 
the recognition of a valuation allowance is recorded as a non cash charge to the income tax provision with an offsetting reserve against the deferred income tax asset 
should we generate pretax losses in future periods  a tax benefit would not be recorded and the valuation allowance recorded would increase 
under these circumstances the net loss recognized and net loss per share for that period would be larger than a comparable period when a favorable tax benefit was recorded 
however  tax provisions or benefits would continue to be recognized  as appropriate  on state and local taxes  and taxes related to foreign jurisdictions 
the recognition of a valuation allowance  in itself  does not affect our ability to utilize the deferred tax asset in the future 
the valuation allowance could be reduced or increased in future years if the estimated realizability of the deferred income tax asset changes  based upon consideration of all available evidence  including changes in the carryback period available under tax law 
contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired  we recognize a loss if the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants  and disposal of wastes  and which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations 
we could incur substantial cleanup costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of our current and former sites as well as third party sites 
with respect to proceedings brought under the federal superfund laws  or similar state statutes  we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at approximately of such sites  excluding those at which we believe we have no future liability 
our involvement is limited or de minimis at approximately of these sites  and the potential loss exposure with respect to any of the remaining individual sites is not considered to be material 
we are a party to various cost sharing arrangements with other prps at the sites 
the terms of the cost sharing arrangements are subject to non disclosure agreements as confidential information 
nevertheless  the cost sharing arrangements generally require all prps to post financial assurance of the performance of the obligations or to pre pay into an escrow or trust account their share of anticipated site related costs 
in addition  the federal government  through various agencies  is a party to several such arrangements 
environmental liabilities are recorded when our liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable 
in many cases  we are not able to determine whether we are liable or  if liability is probable  to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss 
estimates of our liability are further subject to additional uncertainties including the nature and extent of site contamination  available remediation alternatives  the extent of corrective actions that may be required  and the participation  number and financial condition of other prps 
we expect that we will adjust our accruals to reflect new information as appropriate 
future adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period  but we cannot reliably predict the amounts of such future adjustments 
at december   our reserves for environmental matters totaled approximately million 
accruals for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not take into account the effects of inflation  and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
the accruals are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties  but do reflect allocations among prps at federal superfund sites or similar state managed sites after an assessment is made of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites and after appropriate cost sharing or other agreements are entered 
our measurement of environmental liabilities is based on currently available facts  present laws and regulations  and current technology 
such estimates take into consideration our prior experience in site investigation and remediation  the data concerning cleanup costs available from other companies and regulatory authorities  and the professional judgment of our environmental experts in consultation with outside environmental specialists  when necessary 
based on currently available information  we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding the amount already accrued for any of the matters with which we are currently associated either individually or in the aggregate will be an amount that would be material to a decision to buy or sell our securities 
future developments  administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters  however  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
retirement benefits we have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans covering substantially all of our employees 
during the third quarter  we made a million voluntary cash contribution to our us defined pension plan to improve the plan s funded position 
we are not required to make a contribution to the us defined benefit pension plan for  and  based upon current actuarial analyses and forecasts  we do not expect to be required to make cash contributions to the us defined benefit pension plan for at least the next several years 
however  we may elect  depending upon the investment performance of the pension plan assets and other factors  to make additional voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the future 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis  rather than as contributions are made to the plan 
a significant element in determining our pension expense income in accordance with sfas is the expected investment return on plan assets 
in establishing the expected return on plan investments  which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter  we take into consideration input from our third party pension plan asset managers and actuaries regarding the types of securities the plan investments are invested in  how those investments have performed historically  and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future 
for  in light of the declines in the equity markets in through  which comprise a significant portion of our pension plan investments  we lowered our expected return on pension plan investments to  from a expected return on pension plan investments which was used in this assumed rate is applied to the market value of plan assets at the end of the previous year 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in annual pension expense income for the current year 
while the actual return on pension plan investments for was and for was  our expected return on pension plan investments for remains at 
the effect of increasing  or lowering  the expected return on pension plan investments by results in additional annual income  or expense  of approximately million 
the cumulative difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized into pension income or expense over future periods 
the amount of expected return on plan assets can vary significantly from year to year since the calculation is dependent on the market value of plan assets as of the end of the preceding year 
us generally accepted accounting principles allow companies to calculate the expected return on pension assets using either an average of fair market values of pension assets over a period not to exceed five years  which reduces the volatility in reported pension income or expense  or their fair market value at the end of the previous year 
however  the securities and exchange commission currently does not permit companies to change from the fair market value at the end of the previous year methodology  which is the methodology that we use  to an averaging of fair market values of plan assets methodology 
as a result  our results of operations and those of other companies  including companies with which we compete  may not be comparable due to these different methodologies in calculating the expected return on pension investments 
if the five year average of the fair market values of plan assets had been used to calculate retirement benefit costs  we estimate that retirement benefit expense for would have been approximately million less than the million expense recognized using the fair market value approach 
at the end of november of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to value pension plan liabilities 
in accordance with sfas  the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
in estimating this rate  we receive input from our actuaries regarding the rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments with maturities matched to the expected future retirement benefit payments 
based on this assessment at the end of november  we established a discount rate of for valuing the pension liabilities as of the end of  and for determining the pension expense for we had previously assumed a discount rate of for  which determined the expense  and for  which determined the expense 
the effect of lowering the discount rate to increased pension liabilities by approximately million at year end  and is expected to increase pension expense by approximately million in the effect on pension liabilities for changes to the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  are deferred and amortized over future periods in accordance with sfas accounting standards require a minimum pension liability be recorded when the value of pension assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation abo at the annual measurement date 
as of november   our measurement date for pension accounting  the value of the accumulated pension benefit obligation abo exceeded the value of pension investments by approximately million 
in the fourth quarter  as a result of a severe decline in the equity markets in through  higher benefit liabilities from long term labor contracts negotiated in  and a lower assumed discount rate for valuing the pension liabilities  we recorded a non cash charge against stockholders equity of million  net of deferred taxes  to write off our prepaid pension cost representing the previous overfunded portion of the pension plan  and to record a deferred pension asset of million for the unamortized prior service cost relating to prior benefit enhancements 
in the fourth quarter of and  our adjustments of the minimum pension liability resulted in an increase to stockholders equity of million for and million for  presented as other comprehensive income loss 
the recognition of the minimum pension liability in  and the adjustments of minimum pension liability in and do not affect our reported results of operations and do not have a cash impact 
in accordance with accounting standards  the charge against stockholders equity will be adjusted in the fourth quarter of subsequent years to reflect the value of pension assets compared to the abo as of the end of november 
if the level of pension assets exceeds the abo as of a future measurement date  the full charge against stockholders equity would be reversed 
we also sponsor several postretirement plans covering certain hourly and salaried employees and retirees 
these plans provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees 
in certain plans  our contributions towards premiums are capped based upon the cost as of a certain date  thereby creating a defined contribution 
for the non collectively bargained plans  we maintain the right to amend or terminate the plans in the future 
we account for these benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis  rather than as benefits are paid 
we use actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs  to estimate the costs and benefits obligations for the plans 
the discount rate  which is determined annually at the end of november of each year  is developed based upon rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
at the end of  we determined this rate to be  a reduction from a discount rate in and in the effect of lowering the discount rate to from increased postretirement benefit liabilities by approximately million  and expenses are expected to increase by approximately million 
based upon significant cost increases quoted by our medical care providers and predictions of continued significant medical cost inflation in future years  the annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits for health care plans was for and was assumed to gradually decrease to in the year and remain level thereafter 
the other postretirement benefits obligation at end of year did not include the expected favorable impact of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act medicare act  which was signed into law on december  the medicare act provides for a federal subsidy  with tax free payments commencing in  to sponsors of retiree health care benefits plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by the law 
based upon estimates from our actuaries  the federal subsidy included in the law resulted in a reduction in the other postretirement benefits obligation during of million 
this reduction is recognized in the financial statements over a number of years  and is expected to reduce postretirement benefit expense in by approximately million 
certain of these postretirement benefits are funded using plan investments held in a veba trust 
the expected return on plan investments is a significant element in determining postretirement benefits expenses in accordance with sfas in establishing the expected return on plan investments  which is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter  we take into consideration the types of securities the plan investments are invested in  how those investments have performed historically  and expectations for how those investments will perform in the future 
for  our expected return on investments held in the veba trust was 
this assumed long term rate of return on investments is applied to the market value of plan investments at the end of the previous year 
this produces the expected return on plan investments that is included in annual postretirement benefits expenses for the current year 
while the actual return on investments held in the veba trust was in and for  our expected return on investments in the veba trust remains for the expected return on investments held in the veba trust is expected to exceed the return on pension plan investments due to a higher percentage of private equity investments held by the veba trust 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
under sfas  obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets  such as landfill and other facility closure costs  are capitalized and amortized to expense over an asset s useful life using a systematic and rational allocation method 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas on january  resulted in a charge of million  net of tax  or per share  which was recognized in our first quarter statement of operations as a cumulative change in accounting principle  primarily for asset retirement obligations related to landfills 
accretion expense and cash flows associated with aro obligations have not been material since the adoption of fas in december  the medicare act was signed into law 
the medicare act provides for a federal subsidy  with tax free payments commencing in  to sponsors of retiree health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp  which provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the medicare act 
under fsp  the effect of the federal subsidy is accounted for as an actuarial experience gain 
in addition  the effect of the medicare act is taken into consideration  as appropriate  in determining an employer s future per capita claims cost 
based upon estimates from our actuaries  it is expected that the effect of the medicare act will result in a reduction in the accumulated other postretirement benefits obligation of million 
the benefit will be recognized in our financial statements over multiple years as a reduction to postretirement benefits expense 
we adopted fsp in the beginning of the third quarter  resulting in approximately million lower postretirement benefit expense in for  the reduction in expense as a result of the medicare act is estimated to be approximately million 
in december  the fasb finalized statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
this revised standard addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments 
under the revised standard  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
instead  companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize expense in the consolidated statements of income 
sfas r is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r no later than the beginning of our third quarter 
we will adopt the new standard using the modified prospective method and reflect compensation expense in accordance with the fas r transition provisions 
under the modified prospective method  we will not restate prior periods to reflect the impact of adopting the new standard at earlier dates 
pro forma disclosures regarding the effect on our net income and net income per common share had we applied the fair value method of accounting for share based compensation as prescribed by sfas  were million of additional expense  or less net income per common share 
we have not yet determined which fair value model we will follow for future grants of share based compensation 
based on share based compensation granted through december  and the fair values previously calculated under sfas  we project that an immaterial amount of additional compensation expense would be recorded in related to stock options and nonvested stock upon the adoption of sfas r  compared to the existing accounting method under apb opinion no 
we are still evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our total shareholder return share based compensation plan 
in october  the american jobs creation act of jobs creation act was signed into law 
the jobs creation act contains a number of provisions that may affect our future effective income tax rate 
the most significant provisions would allow us to elect to deduct from our taxable income of certain eligible dividends received by ati from non us subsidiaries before the end of if those dividends are reinvested in the us for eligible purposes  and separately  enable ati to receive a tax deduction of up to  when fully phased in over several years  to qualified production activities income  as defined 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp  which requires the qualified production activities deduction be treated as a special deduction which would therefore be recognized as earned 
fsp was effective upon issuance  and required no adjustment to recorded deferred tax balances  which are determined using projected future income tax rates 
in december  the fasb also issued fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp  which provided additional time beyond the financial statement date of the period in which a new tax law is enacted  or december  for ati  for a company to evaluate the effect of the jobs creation act 
in accordance with the provisions of fsp  we continue to evaluate the repatriation provision  including ongoing clarifications to how the jobs creation act is to be applied 
based on this evaluation  we are unable to determine if there will be any material impact to results from the jobs creation act foreign earnings repatriation provision

forward looking statements from time to time  the company has made and may continue to make forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of certain statements in this report relate to future events and expectations and  as such  constitute forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include those containing such words as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  would  should  will  will likely result  forecast  outlook  projects  and similar expressions 
such forward looking statements are based on management s current expectations and include known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which the company is unable to predict or control  that may cause our actual results or performance to materially differ from any future results or performance expressed or implied by such statements 
various of these factors are described from time to time in the company filings with the securities and exchange commission  including reports on form q 
we assume no duty to update our forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in such forward looking statements include the following cyclical demand for products 
the cyclical nature of the industries in which our customers operate causes demand for our products to be cyclical  creating uncertainty regarding future profitability 
various changes in general economic conditions affect the industries in which our customers operate 
these changes include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers products due to economic downturns 
other factors causing fluctuation in our customers positions are changes in market demand  lower overall pricing due to domestic and international overcapacity  currency fluctuations  lower priced imports and increases in use or decreases in prices of substitute materials 
as a result of these factors  our profitability has been and may in the future be subject to significant fluctuation 
a significant portion of the sales of our high performance metals segment represents products sold to customers in the commercial aerospace industry 
from time to time  economic and other factors  including the september  terrorist attacks  have adversely affected the airline industry  resulting in overall reduced demand for the products that we sell to the commercial aerospace market 
a downturn in the commercial aerospace industry could adversely affect our results of operations  and our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
product pricing 
from time to time  intense competition and excess manufacturing capacity in the commodity stainless steel industry have resulted in reduced prices  excluding raw material surcharges  for many of our stainless steel products 
these factors have had and may have an adverse impact on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
although inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate  during the same period certain critical raw material costs  such as nickel and scrap containing iron and nickel  have been volatile 
while we are able to mitigate some of the adverse impact of rising raw material costs through surcharges to customers  rapid increases in raw material costs may adversely affect our results of operations 
we change prices on certain of our products from time to time 
the ability to implement price increases is dependent on market conditions  economic factors  raw material costs and availability  competitive factors  operating costs and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
the benefits of any price increases may be delayed due to long manufacturing lead times and the terms of existing contracts 
dependence on critical raw materials or services subject to price and availability fluctuations 
we rely to a substantial extent on outside vendors to supply certain raw materials that are critical to the manufacture of our products 
we also depend on third parties to provide conversion services that may be critical to the manufacture of our products 
purchase prices and availability of these critical raw materials are subject to volatility 
at any given time  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials or services on a timely basis  on price and other terms acceptable  or at all 
if suppliers increase the price of critical raw materials  we may not have alternative sources of supply 
in addition  to the extent that we have quoted prices to customers and accepted customer orders for products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials  or have existing contracts  we may be unable to raise the price of products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials 
the manufacture of some of our products is a complex process and requires long lead times 
as a result  we may experience delays or shortages in the supply of raw materials or conversion services 
if unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of required raw materials or conversion services  we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of products 
this could cause us to lose sales  incur additional costs  delay new product introductions and suffer harm to our reputation 
we acquire certain important raw materials that we use to produce specialty materials  including nickel  chrome  cobalt  titanium sponge and ammonia paratungstate  from foreign sources 
some of these sources operate in countries that may be subject to unstable political and economic conditions 
these conditions may disrupt supplies or affect the prices of these materials 
volatility of raw material costs 
the prices for many of the raw materials we use have recently been extremely volatile 
since we value most of our inventory utilizing the last in  first out lifo inventory costing methodology  a rapid rise in raw material costs has a negative effect on our operating results 
under the lifo inventory valuation method  changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these material and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle 
for example  in  the increase in raw material costs on our lifo inventory valuation method resulted in cost of sales which was million higher than would have been recognized if we utilized the first in  first out fifo methodology to value our inventory 
in a period of rising raw material prices  cost of sales expense recognized under lifo is generally higher than the cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold 
conversely  in a period of declining raw material prices  cost of sales recognized under lifo is generally lower than cash costs incurred to acquire the inventory sold 
availability of energy resources 
we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products 
the prices for and availability of electricity  natural gas  oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions 
these market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control 
disruptions in the supply of energy resources could temporarily impair the ability to manufacture products for customers 
further  increases in energy costs  or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors  has and may continue to adversely affect our profitability 
to the extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive  increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with retirement benefits 
our us defined benefit pension plan was funded in accordance with erisa as of december  based upon current actuarial analyses and forecasts  we do not expect to be required to make contributions to the defined benefit pension plan for at least the next several years 
however  a significant decline in the value of plan investments in the future or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding 
depending on the timing and amount  a requirement that we fund our defined benefit pension plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with accessing the credit markets 
our ability to access the credit markets in the future to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be influenced by the company s credit rating 
however  changes in our credit rating do not impact our access to our existing credit facilities 
credit agreement covenant 
the agreement governing our secured bank credit facility imposes a number of covenants on us 
for example  it contains covenants that create limitations on our ability to  among other things  effect acquisitions or dispositions or incur additional debt  and require us to  among other things  maintain a financial ratio when our available borrowing capacity measured under the credit agreement decreases below million 
our ability to comply with the financial covenant may be affected by events beyond our control and  as a result  we may be unable to comply with the covenant  which may adversely affect our ability to borrow under our secured credit facility if the availability level is below million 
risks associated with environmental matters 
we are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants  and disposal of wastes  and which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations 
we could incur substantial cleanup costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of our current and former sites as well as third party locations sites 
with respect to proceedings brought under the federal superfund laws  or similar state statutes  we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at approximately of such sites  excluding those at which we believe we have no future liability 
our involvement is limited or de minimis at approximately of these sites  and the potential loss exposure with respect to any of the remaining individual sites is not considered to be material 
we are a party to various cost sharing arrangements with other prps at the sites 
the terms of the cost sharing arrangements are subject to non disclosure agreements as confidential information 
nevertheless  the cost sharing arrangements generally require all prps to post financial assurance of the performance of the obligations or to pre pay into an escrow or trust account their share of anticipated site related costs 
in addition  the federal government  through various agencies  is a party to several such arrangements 
we believe that we operate our businesses in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
however  we are a party to lawsuits and other proceedings involving alleged violations of  or liabilities arising from environmental laws 
when our liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate our costs  we record environmental liabilities in our financial statements 
in many cases  we are not able to determine whether we are liable  or if liability is probable  to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss 
estimates of our liability remain subject to additional uncertainties  including the nature and extent of site contamination  available remediation alternatives  the extent of corrective actions that may be required  and the participation number and financial condition of other prps  as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 
we expect that we will adjust our accruals to reflect new information as appropriate 
future adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period  but we cannot reliably predict the amounts of such future adjustments 
at december   our reserves for environmental matters totaled approximately million 
based on currently available information  we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding the amount already accrued for any of the sites with which the we are currently associated either individually or in the aggregate will be an amount that would be material to a decision to buy or sell our securities 
future developments  administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters  however  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
risks associated with current or future litigation and claims 
a number of lawsuits  claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our currently and formerly owned business  including those pertaining to product liability  patent infringement  commercial  employment  employee benefits  taxes  environmental and health and safety  and stockholder matters 
due to the uncertainties of litigation  we can give no assurance that we will prevail on all claims made against us in the lawsuits that we currently face or that additional claims will not be made against us in the future 
while the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty  and some of these lawsuits  claims or proceedings may be determined adversely to us  we do not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity  although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period 
also  we can give no assurance that any other matters brought in the future will not have a material effect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
labor matters 
we have approximately  full time employees 
a portion of our workforce is covered by various collective bargaining agreements  principally with the united steelworkers of america uswa  including approximately  allegheny ludlum production  office and maintenance employees covered by collective bargaining agreements  which are effective through june  approximately oremet employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement  which is effective through june  approximately wah chang employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement  which continues through march  and approximately employees at the casting service facility in laporte  indiana  covered by a collective bargaining agreement  which is effective through december generally  agreements that expire may be terminated after notice by the union 
after termination  the union may authorize a strike 
a strike by the employees covered by one or more of the collective bargaining agreements could have a materially adverse affect on our operating results 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed in concluding collective bargaining agreements with the unions to replace those that expire 
risks associated with acquisition and disposition strategies 
we intend to continue to strategically position our businesses in order to improve our ability to compete 
we plan to do this by seeking specialty niches  expanding our global presence  acquiring businesses complementary to existing strengths and continually evaluating the performance and strategic fit of existing business units 
we regularly consider acquisition  joint ventures  and other business combination opportunities as well as possible business unit dispositions 
from time to time  management holds discussions with management of other companies to explore such opportunities 
as a result  the relative makeup of the businesses comprising our company is subject to change 
acquisitions  joint ventures  and other business combinations involve various inherent risks  such as assessing accurately the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition or other transaction candidates  the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business  our ability to achieve identified financial and operating synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition or other transaction  and unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquisition or other transaction 
international acquisitions and other transactions could be affected by export controls  exchange rate fluctuations  domestic and foreign political conditions and a deterioration in domestic and foreign economic conditions 
internal controls over financial reporting 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
insurance 
we have maintained various forms of insurance  including insurance covering claims related to our properties and risks associated with our operations 
our existing property and liability insurance coverages contain exclusions and limitations on coverage 
in connection with renewals of insurance  we have experienced additional exclusions and limitations on coverage  larger self insured retentions and deductibles and significantly higher premiums 
as a result  in the future our insurance coverage may not cover claims to the extent that it has in the past and the costs that we incur to procure insurance may increase significantly  either of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
political and social turmoil 
the war on terrorism and recent political and social turmoil  including terrorist and military actions and the implications of the military actions in iraq  could put pressure on economic conditions in the united states and worldwide 
these political  social and economic conditions could make it difficult for us  our suppliers and our customers to forecast accurately and plan future business activities  and could adversely affect the financial condition of our suppliers and customers and affect customer decisions as to the amount and timing of purchases from us 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
export sales 
we believe that export sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our future revenues 
risks associated with export sales include political and economic instability  including weak conditions in the world s economies  accounts receivable collection  export controls  changes in legal and regulatory requirements  policy changes affecting the markets for our products  changes in tax laws and tariffs  and exchange rate fluctuations which may affect sales to international customers and the value of profits earned on export sales when converted into dollars 
any of these factors could materially adversely effect our results for the period in which they occur 
risks associated with government contracts 
some of our operating companies directly perform contractual work for the us government 
various claims whether based on us government or company audits and investigations or otherwise could be asserted against us related to our us government contract work 
depending on the circumstances and the outcome  such proceedings could result in fines  penalties  compensatory and treble damages or the cancellation or suspension of payments under one or more us government contracts 
under government regulations  a company  or one or more of its operating divisions or units  can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts based on the results of investigations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and other matters interest rate risk 
we attempt to maintain a reasonable balance between fixed and floating rate debt to keep financing costs as low as possible 
at december   we had approximately million of floating rate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
since the interest rate on this debt floats with the short term market rate of interest  we are exposed to the risk that these interest rates may increase 
for example  a hypothetical in rate of interest on million of outstanding floating rate debt would result in increased annual financing costs of million 
approximately million of this floating rate debt is capped at a maximum interest rate 
volatility of energy prices 
energy resources markets are subject to conditions that create uncertainty in the prices and availability of energy resources 
the prices for and availability of electricity  natural gas  oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions 
these market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control 
increases in energy costs  or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors  has and may continue to adversely affect our profitability 
to the extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive  increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we use approximately to million mmbtu s of natural gas annually  depending upon business conditions  in the manufacture of our products 
these purchases of natural gas expose us to risk of higher gas prices 
for example  a hypothetical per mmbtu increase in the price of natural gas would result in increased annual energy costs of approximately to million 
volatility of raw material prices 
we use raw materials surcharge and index mechanisms to offset the impact of increased raw material costs  however  competitive factors in the marketplace can limit our ability to institute such mechanisms  and there can be a delay between the increase in the price of raw materials and the realization of the benefit of such mechanisms 
for example  since we generally use in excess of  tons of nickel each year  a hypothetical change of per pound in nickel prices would result in increased costs of approximately million 
in addition  we also use in excess of  tons of ferrous scrap in the production of our products and a hypothetical change of per ton would result in increased costs of approximately million 
while we enter into raw materials futures contracts from time to time to hedge exposure to price fluctuations  such as for nickel  we cannot be certain that our hedge position adequately reduces exposure 
we believe that we have adequate controls to monitor these contracts  but we may not be able to accurately assess exposure to price volatility in the markets for critical raw materials
