item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview our business model is based primarily upon the design  production and sale of wireless connectivity software for use with wireless communication networks worldwide 
our products are utilized with major wireless networks throughout the world that support data communications through the use of cell phones or other wireless communication devices such as pc cards 
wireless network providers generally incorporate our products into their accessory products sold directly to individual consumers to offer wireless pc data connectivity to their wireless networks 
our business is primarily dependent upon the demand for wireless communications and the corresponding requirements for wireless connectivity software to support this demand 
during the last three years  demand for these types of products has fluctuated dramatically  and there has been a significant increase in price competition within our industry 
these factors have led to swings in our revenues and contributed to the operating losses reported in our financial results 
we continue to invest in research and development of wireless software products  and we believe that we have one the industry s leading wireless product lines in terms of performance and features 
we believe that our out of the box design technology further differentiates our products 
we also sell ebusiness and utility software and professional consulting services related to ebusiness applications 
during  we have maintained a sharp focus on our operating cost structure while ensuring that we maintain our operating flexibility to support future growth in the industry 
we measure success by monitoring our net sales and gross margins and operating cash flow 
we believe that there continues to be excellent growth opportunities within the wireless communications software marketplace and we continue to focus on positioning smith micro to benefit from these opportunities 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operating data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 
table of contents years ended december  net revenues products services total net revenues cost of revenues products services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss interest income income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss revenues total net revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  with an increase of million  or from to and an increase of  or  from to we currently operate in two business segments products and services 
in addition  product revenues are broken down into two business units  wireless and oem and internet direct sales 
our internet direct sales unit includes utility and fax software products as well as consulting  fulfillment and hosting revenue 
the following table shows the net revenues and cost of revenues generated by each segment year ended december  products services products services products services wireless oem internet direct total revenues cost of revenues gross profit products 
net revenues from sales of products were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or from to and  or from to product revenues accounted for of total revenues in  of total revenues 
table of contents in and of total revenues in the change in our product revenue from to is primarily due to the increase in sales to verizon of million consisting of sales of quicklink mobile and quicklink mobile phonebook 
internet direct sales decreased  reflecting the move out of the retail distribution channel 
product revenues from to  while fairly flat  reflect a significant change from core fax technology products to new wireless communications products for wireless oem 
we traditionally have relatively little backlog for our oem products at any given time and we have not considered backlog to be a significant indicator of future performance 
however  as our wireless business has evolved  production cycle time for items such as data kits has increased to the point that orders received towards the end of a quarter may not ship until the subsequent quarter 
additionally  customers may issue purchase orders that have extended delivery dates that may cause the shipment to fall in a subsequent quarter 
therefore  in  we began tracking our quarterly backlog situation although the level of backlog is not necessarily indicative of trends in our business 
as of december  however  we had a backlog of million resulting from orders placed late in the fourth quarter and not shipped 
since we generally do not produce software in advance of anticipated orders our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
services 
consulting services revenues were   and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or from to and a decrease of  or from to services revenue accounted for of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in the decrease in service revenue is due to the reduced focus on consulting services  which was announced in the first quarter of  due to the decrease in demand for such services 
cost of revenues cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  from to and remaining fairly constant in and the cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue was in  in and in the increase in is consistent with the growth in product revenues of  the majority of which is primarily related to the increase in sales to verizon as indicated above 
during the period from through  the cost of product revenue has moved from being heavily retail product driven to primarily wireless software kit related 
software kits often contain a hardware element  such as a cable  which result in slightly lower margins 
cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues was   and  in  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or from to and a decrease of  or from to cost of service revenues includes the cost of our consulting personnel and the cost of any outside consultants contracted to support our staff 
the increase in the cost of service revenues from to is due to increased consulting labor costs and modest hardware sales not present in the decrease in the cost of service revenues from to was due to headcount reductions related to the elimination of selected microsoft products consulting services announced in the first quarter of cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues was in  in and in operating expenses the following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses by functional category and as a percentage of total net revenues 
table of contents years ended december  operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing decreases of  or  from to and  or  from to our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  advertising costs  sales commissions and trade show expenses 
these expenses vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of trade shows and product introductions 
the decrease in these costs from to is directly attributable to the elimination of channel marketing expenses of approximately  and the elimination of depreciation and other miscellaneous expenses of  relating to the san diego sales office which was closed in these decreases were offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses of approximately  which relates to the reallocation of resources from other departments to sales and marketing 
the decrease in these costs from to is directly attributable to stringent cost reduction measures in all the above expense areas as implemented by management in late advertising expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses were  and of revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
decreases in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues were caused by the increase in revenues as well as the absolute dollar decreases discussed above 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or from to and  or  from to our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and equipment costs required to conduct our software development efforts 
we remain focused on the development and expansion of our technology  particularly our wireless  diagnostic  utility and internet software technologies 
the increase in our research and development expenses in each year was primarily due to the development of new wireless products that were released during the periods  with an accompanying increase in headcount and a refocus of engineering resources from consulting projects to development 
research and development expenses were  and of revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues from to is due to the significant increase in revenues during the period 
the increase from to is primarily due to the absolute dollar increase discussed above  slightly offset by the small increase in revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to and  or from to the increase in general and administrative costs from to consist of increases in accounting  legal and consulting fees of approximately  travel expenses of approximately  and compensation and benefit costs of approximately  general and administrative costs in and were relatively flat as we reduced costs to align our general and administrative cost base with existing revenues 
general and administrative expenses were  and of revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from to is due to the increase in revenues  partially offset by the absolute dollar increase in expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from to is due to the increase in revenues and the absolute dollar decrease in expenses 
interest income 
interest income was   and  in  and  respectively  representing an increase of  or from to and a decrease of  or  from to 
table of contents the differences in our interest income are directly related to the fluctuations in our cash balances during the periods and changing interest rates 
we have not changed our investment strategy during the periods being reported  with our excess cash consistently being invested in short term marketable securities 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion elsewhere in this report 
provision for income taxes 
in the years ended december  and december   we reported a provision for income taxes in the amounts of  and  respectively 
in the year ended december   we reported an income tax benefit in the amount of million 
the provision in relates to alternative minimum tax liability 
the provision in consists of minimum payments for state taxes 
the benefit in is the result of a net operating loss carry back  which  pursuant to a change in federal tax law  allowed us to file for a refund of income taxes paid in prior to the tax law change such amount was included in the net operating loss carry forward  which had carried a full valuation allowance 
we have provided a valuation allowance on of our deferred tax assets 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance against such asset 
factors that are considered in the evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset are continued profitability and our ability to meet our future forecasts 
in general  any realization of our net deferred tax asset will reduce the effective rate in future periods 
however  the realization of deferred tax assets that are related to net operating losses that were generated by tax deductions resulting from the exercise of non qualified stock options  will result in a direct increase to stockholders equity 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and from net proceeds of million generated by our initial public offering in our principal source of liquidity as of december  consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million 
net cash provided by operations was million in compared with cash used in operations of  in this difference in operating cash flows is primarily due to the increase in net income in this was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable 
cash flows used in investing activities were  in and  in  related to investments in property and equipment  including computers and production equipment 
cash flows from financing activities were million in and  in this was the result of stock options being exercised by employees  net of a tax adjustment in and cash used to repurchase company stock in the first quarter of at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
we have no significant capital commitments  and currently anticipate that capital expenditures will not vary significantly from recent periods 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 
we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
if additional financing is needed  we cannot assure that such financing will be available to us at commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we have non cancelable operating leases for our facilities in aliso viejo  california and lee s summit  missouri which expire in may and june  respectively 
as of december   we had no debt and no long term liabilities 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands 
table of contents payments due by period more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total on february   we entered into a common stock purchase agreement for the private placement of  shares of our common stock  par value  at a price of per share  resulting in aggregate gross cash proceeds to the company of  and approximate net cash proceeds to the company of  the transaction closed simultaneously with the execution of the purchase agreement on february  ce unterberg  towbin llc  the placement agent for the transaction  received a cash fee equal to of the aggregate gross proceeds of the private placement 
the form of the purchase agreement was filed as exhibit to our current report on form k which was filed on february  during our normal course of business  we have made certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include intellectual property indemnities to our customers and licensees in connection with the use  sale and or license of our products  indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease  indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on the negligence or willful misconduct  indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts  and indemnities to directors and officers of the company to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 
in addition  we have made contractual commitments to employees providing for severance payments upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events 
we may also issue a guarantee in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain customer contracts 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  may be indefinite 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees may not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we review our estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in our business or new information as it becomes available 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition software revenue is recognized in accordance with the statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to seller is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we recognize revenues from sales of our software to oem customers or end users as completed products are shipped and title passes  or from royalties generated as authorized customers duplicate our software  if the other requirements of sop are met 
if the requirements of sop are not met at the date of shipment  revenue is not recognized until 
table of contents these elements are known or resolved 
returns from oem customers are limited to defective goods or goods shipped in error 
historically  oem customer returns have not exceeded the very nominal estimates and reserves 
in  we exited the retail distribution channel 
prior to that time  we permitted reseller customers to return or exchange product and provided price protection on products unsold by a customer 
as a result  revenue from resellers was recognized upon sell through to the end customer  rather than upon shipment 
product sales directly to end users are recognized upon delivery 
end users have a thirty day right of return  but such returns have historically been immaterial 
we also provide technical support to our customers 
such costs have historically been insignificant 
service revenues include sales of consulting services  website hosting and fulfillment 
we recognize service revenues as services are provided or as milestones are delivered and accepted by our customers 
accounts receivable we sell our products worldwide 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
we estimate credit losses and maintain a bad debt reserve based upon these estimates 
while such credit losses have historically been within our estimated reserves  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if not  this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill we have adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  and no impairment was identified 
as a result of the adoption  we are no longer required to amortize goodwill 
prior to the adoption of sfas  goodwill was amortized over years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
our annual impairment testing date is december recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of the underlying net assets in the reporting units 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the fair value of its net assets  goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its other assets and liabilities 
we determined that we did not have any impairment of goodwill at december  estimates of reporting unit fair value are based upon market capitalization and therefore are volatile being sensitive to market fluctuations 
to the extent that our market capitalization decreases significantly or the allocation of value to our reporting units changes  we could be required to write off some or all of our goodwill 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  sfas no 
requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we currently have a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
to the extent that it becomes more likely than not that we will recover such assets  we would be required to reverse some or all of the valuation allowance 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
in addition  sfas no 
r will cause unrecognized expense based on the amounts in our pro forma footnote disclosure related to options vesting after 
table of contents the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining vesting period 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in our third quarter of  beginning july  under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition alternatives include prospective and retroactive adoption methods 
under the retroactive methods  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and share awards beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r and we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas no 
r 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides new guidelines for the evaluation and determination of whether a loss on certain investments is other than temporary and requires certain additional disclosures pertaining to unrealized investment losses in a company s financial statements 
the effective date of the evaluation and measurement criteria of issue no 
have been delayed pending issuance of additional implementation guidance by the fasb 
the additional disclosure requirements  however  remain effective for annual periods ending after december  we continue to monitor the fasb s progress and do not currently expect the adoption of the evaluation and measurement criteria  once issued to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
risk factors our future operating results are highly uncertain 
before deciding to invest in our common stock or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our subsequent reports on forms k  q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  that could seriously harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including the following the size and timing of orders from and shipments to our major customers  the size and timing of any return product requests for our products  our ability to maintain or increase gross margins  variations in our sales channels or the mix of our product sales  the gain or loss of a key customer  our ability to specify  develop  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  
table of contents the availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effect on sales and pricing of our products  the effect of new and emerging technologies  deferrals of orders by our customers in anticipation of new products  applications  product enhancements or operating systems  and general economic and market conditions 
a large portion of our operating expenses  including rent  depreciation and amortization is fixed and difficult to reduce or change 
accordingly  if our total revenue does not meet our expectations  we may not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in revenue 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance 
although we have begun reporting backlog  our ability to predict our revenues and operating results is extremely limited 
we have historically operated with little backlog because we have generally shipped our software products and recognized revenue shortly after we received orders because our production cycle has traditionally been very short 
as a result  our sales in any quarter were generally dependent on orders that were booked and shipped in that quarter 
as our wireless business has evolved  production cycle time for items such as data kits has increased to the point that orders received towards the end of a quarter may not ship until the subsequent quarter 
additionally  customers may issue purchase orders that have extended delivery dates that may cause the shipment to fall in a subsequent quarter 
these situations make it difficult for us to predict what our revenues and operating results will be in any quarter 
therefore  the level of backlog is not necessarily indicative of trends in our business 
as of december   we had a backlog of approximately million 
we depend upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
in the past we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to a small number of customers and expect to continue to do so in the future 
the agreements we have with these entities do not require them to purchase any minimum quantity of our products and may be terminated by the entity or us at any time for any reason upon minimal prior written notice 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that these customers will continue to place large orders for our products in the future  or purchase our products at all 
our largest oem customer accounted for and of our net revenues in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our three largest oem customers accounted for and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our customers may acquire products from our competitors or develop their own products that compete directly with ours 
any substantial decrease or delay in our sales to one or more of these entities in any quarter would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  certain of our customers have in the past and may in the future acquire competitors or be acquired by competitors  causing further industry consolidation 
in the past  such acquisitions have caused the purchasing departments of the combined companies to reevaluate their purchasing decisions 
if one of our major customers engages in an acquisition in the future  it could change its current purchasing habits 
in that event  we could lose the customer  or experience a decrease in orders from that customer or a delay in orders previously made by that customer 
further  although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  the insolvency of one or more of our major customers could result in a substantial decrease in our revenues 

table of contents competition within our product markets is intense and includes numerous established competitors  which could negatively affect our revenues 
we operate in markets that are extremely competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology 
specifically  microsoft corporation poses a significant competitive threat to us because microsoft operating systems may include some capabilities now provided by certain of our oem and retail software products 
if users are satisfied relying on the capabilities of the windows based systems or other operating systems  or other vendors products  sales of our products are likely to decline 
in addition  because there are low barriers to entry into the software market  we expect significant competition from both established and emerging software companies in the future 
furthermore  many of our existing and potential oem customers may acquire or develop products that compete directly with our products 
microsoft and many of our other current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  service  support  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
there is also a substantial risk that announcements of competing products by large competitors such as microsoft or other vendors could result in the cancellation of orders by customers in anticipation of the introduction of such new products 
in addition  some of our competitors currently make complementary products that are sold separately 
such competitors could decide to enhance their competitive position by bundling their products to attract customers seeking integrated  cost effective software applications 
some competitors have a retail emphasis and offer oem products with a reduced set of features 
the opportunity for retail upgrade sales may induce these and other competitors to make oem products available at their own cost or even at a loss 
we also expect competition to increase as a result of software industry consolidations  which may lead to the creation of additional large and well financed competitors 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced margins and loss of market share 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may disrupt our business and divert management attention and cause our current operations to suffer 
we have in the past made and we expect to continue to consider acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we make any additional acquisitions  we will be required to assimilate the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from our company s day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
acquisitions may also subject us to liabilities and risks that are not known or identifiable at the time of the acquisition 
we may also have to incur debt or issue equity securities in order to finance future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our existing stockholders 
in addition  we expect our profitability could be adversely affected because of acquisition related accounting costs and write offs 
in consummating acquisitions  we are also subject to risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have had limited or no prior experience 
if we are unable to fully integrate acquired businesses  products or technologies within existing operations  we may not receive the intended benefits of acquisitions 
if the adoption of new technologies and services grows more slowly than anticipated in our product planning and development  our future sales and profits may be negatively affected 
if the adoption of new technologies and services does not grow or grows more slowly than anticipated in our product planning and development  demand for certain of our products and services will be reduced 
for example  our new quicklink mobile wi fi product provides notebook users with the ability to roam between wireless wide area networks wwan and wi fi hot spots 
another product  quicklink wi fi  allows users to 
table of contents seek out and select available hot spots in their area 
therefore  future sales and any future profits from these and related products are substantially dependent upon the widespread acceptance and use of wi fi as an effective medium of communication by consumers and businesses 
our products may contain undetected software errors  which could negatively affect our revenues 
our software products are complex and may contain undetected errors 
in the past  we have discovered software errors in certain of our products and have experienced delayed or lost revenues during the period it took to correct these errors 
although we and our oem customers test our products  it is possible that errors may be found in our new or existing products after we have commenced commercial shipment of those products 
these undetected errors could result in adverse publicity  loss of revenues  delay in market acceptance of our products or claims against us by customers 
technology and customer needs change rapidly in our market  which could render our products obsolete and negatively affect our revenue 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards 
we will also need to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products to meet our customers changing demands  keep up with evolving industry standards  including changes in the microsoft operating systems with which our products are designed to be compatible  and to promote those products successfully 
the communications and utilities software markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and short product life cycles 
any of these factors could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
in addition  new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods as a result of the complexities inherent in today s computing environments and the performance demanded by customers 
if our software markets do not develop as we anticipate  or our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets or if we are unable to develop new versions of our software products that can operate on future operating systems  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
delays or failure in deliveries from our component suppliers could cause our net revenue to decline and harm our results of operations 
we rely on third party suppliers to provide us with services and components for our product kits 
these components include compact discs  cables  printed manuals  and boxes 
we do not have long term supply arrangements with any vendor to obtain these necessary services and components for our products 
if we are unable to purchase components from these suppliers or if the compact disc replication services that we use do not deliver our requirements on schedule  we may not be able to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis or enter into new orders because of a shortage in components 
any delays that we experience in delivering our products to customers could impair our customer relationships and adversely impact our reputation and our business 
in addition  if our third party suppliers raise their prices for components or services  our gross margins would be reduced 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights  which could negatively impact our revenues 
our success is dependent upon our software code base  our programming methodologies and other intellectual properties and proprietary rights 
in order to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on a combination of trade secret  nondisclosure and copyright and trademark law 
we currently own united states trademark registrations for certain of our trademarks and united states patents for certain of our technologies  however  these measures afford us only limited protection 
furthermore  we rely primarily on shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
accordingly  it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain our rights without our authorization 
it is also possible that third parties may 
table of contents independently develop technologies similar to ours 
it may be difficult for us to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of trademarks  patents  copyrights and other intellectual property rights asserted by companies in our industry grows and the coverage of these patents and other rights and the functionality of software products increasingly overlap 
from time to time  we have received communications from third parties asserting that our trade name or features  content  or trademarks of certain of our products infringe upon intellectual property rights held by such third parties 
we have also received correspondence from third parties separately asserting that our fax products may infringe on certain patents held by each of the parties 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others  third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to our current or future products 
infringement claims  whether with or without merit  could result in time consuming and costly litigation  divert the attention of our management  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties 
if we are required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  they may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
unfavorable royalty or licensing agreements could seriously impair our ability to market our products 
our stock price is highly volatile 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
these fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  market conditions within our retail and oem software markets  general global economic and political instability  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of high technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of a securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial losses and divert management s attention and resources from other matters 
if we are unable to retain key personnel  the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our senior management and other key technical and consulting personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with our key employees that govern the length of their service 
the loss of the services of our key employees would materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly highly skilled engineers involved in the ongoing research 
table of contents and development required to develop and enhance our communication software products as well those in our highly specialized consulting business 
competition for these employees remains high and employee retention is a common problem in our industry 
our inability to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are essential to our product development  consulting services  marketing  service and support teams may limit the rate at which we can generate revenue  develop new products or product enhancements and generally would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  retaining key employees during restructuring efforts is critical to our company s success 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future through the issuance of additional equity  or convertible debt securities or by borrowing money  in order to meet our capital needs 
additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us to allow us to meet our capital needs 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need or choose to obtain additional financing to fund our activities 
we could raise these funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations or other business activities significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish right to certain technologies or potential markets 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
we currently have no established line of credit or other business borrowing facility in place 
it is possible that our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors response to our products  and our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected as a result of legal  business and economic risks specific to international operations 
approximately  and of our revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
we also frequently ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
in the future  we may expand these international business activities 
international operations are subject to many inherent risks  including 
table of contents general political  social and economic instability  trade restrictions  the imposition of governmental controls  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  foreign technical standards  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in securing and servicing international customers  difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
these conditions may increase our cost of doing business 
moreover  as our customers are adversely affected by these conditions  our business with them may be disrupted and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the sale of significant numbers of shares of our common stock by any of our principal stockholders 
a total of  shares of our common stock was recently sold in a private placement in february  and we expect to file a registration statement covering the resale of such shares in april in addition  there are other large blocks of shares held by individual stockholders which are eligible for resale under rule  including william w 
smith  who held  shares at february   and rhonda l 
smith who held  shares 
overall  our trading volume fluctuates widely and at times is relatively limited 
the market price for our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a large number of the shares or the perception that such sales may occur 
the sale of a large number of our common stock also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and at the prices that we deem appropriate 
we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny and may sustain a loss of public confidence if we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls over financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to such evaluation on an annual basis 
compliance with these requirements can be expensive and time consuming 
while we believe that we will be able to meet the required deadlines  no assurance can be given that we will meet the required deadlines in future years 
if we fail to timely complete this evaluation  or if our auditors cannot timely attest to our evaluation  we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls 
provisions of our charter and bylaws and delaware law could make a takeover of our company difficult 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage or prevent a third party from acquiring us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for instance  our certificate of 
table of contents incorporation authorizes the board of directors to fix the rights and preferences of shares of any series of preferred stock  without action by our stockholders 
as a result  the board can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock  which could delay or prevent a change of control because the rights given to the holders of such preferred stock may prohibit a merger  reorganization  sale or other extraordinary corporate transaction 
in addition  we are organized under the laws of the state of delaware and certain provisions of delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control 
we may be subject to additional risks 
the risks and uncertainties described above are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents 
at december   the carrying values of our financial instruments approximated fair values based on current market prices and rates 
because of their short duration  changes in market interest rates would not have a material effect on fair value 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently have any significant foreign currency exposure as we do not transact business in foreign currencies 
as such  we do not have significant currency exposure at december
