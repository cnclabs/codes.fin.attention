the second  cosco container lines company limited  a company headquartered in china  is ranked as the ninth largest container liner operator in the world 
private container programs cronos manages containers pursuant to agreements negotiated directly with corporations  partnerships and private individuals located in europe  the united states and south africa 
the terms of the agreements vary from to years and take two principal forms 
under the first form of agreement  cronos generally earns compensation equal to gross lease revenue less direct operating expenses less the payment to the managed container programs  computed in accordance with the terms of each individual agreement 
in certain cases  cronos may also earn an incentive fee 
under the second form of agreement  the container owner is entitled to a fixed payment for a specified term see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations herein 
owned containers cronos uses various forms of funding to finance its owned fleet including bank loans and capital leases 
from time to time  cronos also owns containers on a temporary basis until such time that the containers are sold to the managed container programs 
most containers identified for sale to managed container programs are purchased new by cronos  and sold to owners of managed container programs within six months 
this strategy allows cronos more flexibility to negotiate and buy containers strategically  based on market conditions 
in addition  cronos may on occasion own equipment that has been acquired specifically for resale to third parties that does not enter the cronos managed fleet 
assets that are funded by capital leases are initially reported at the fair value of the asset categorized within container equipment  with an equivalent liability reported as capital lease obligations 
container equipment is depreciated over its expected useful life 
finance charges are reported over the lease term in accordance with the effective interest method and are recorded as interest expense 
employees as of december   cronos had employees worldwide  were located in europe  in the united states and in asia and australia combined 
none of cronos employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
acquisition policy cronos acquisition policy for the total fleet is driven by capital availability  market requirements and anticipated future demand  including demand generated by trade growth and the replacement of containers retired around the world 
the group believes that the worldwide manufacturing capacity for all container types is adequate to meet its current and near term requirements 
in recent years  china has emerged as the primary location for almost all types of container manufacturing 
refrigeration units  which represent approximately half of the cost of a refrigerated container  are purchased from the two primary suppliers of container refrigeration units headquartered in the united states  both of which have manufacturing plants in the far east 
these units are shipped to the container manufacturer for installation into the container 

table of contents all of the tank containers in the cronos fleet have been purchased from manufacturers based in china  south africa  the united kingdom and belgium 
repair and maintenance all containers are inspected and repaired when redelivered in accordance with standardized industry guidelines 
depots in major port areas perform repair and maintenance work that is verified by either independent surveyors or the cronos technical and operations staff 
as described under item business lease profile some customers enter into a damage protection plan 
all other customers are obligated to pay for all damage repairs  excluding wear and tear 
before any repair or refurbishment is authorized on older containers in the cronos fleet  the cronos technical and operations staff review the age  condition and type of container and its suitability for continued leasing 
cronos compares the cost of such repair or refurbishment with the prevailing market resale price that might be obtained for that container and makes the decision whether to repair or sell the container accordingly 
cronos is authorized to make this decision on behalf of most of the owners for whom it manages equipment and makes the decision by applying the same standards to the managed containers as to its own containers 
disposition of used containers cronos estimates that the useful operational life for most containers in the group fleet ranges from to years 
cronos disposes of used containers in a worldwide secondary market in which buyers include wholesalers  mini storage operators  construction companies and others 
the market for used containers generally depends on new container prices  the quantity of containers targeted for disposal and the overall lease market for containers at a particular location 
operations cronos sales and marketing operations are conducted through cronos containers limited ccl  a wholly owned subsidiary based in the united kingdom 
ccl is supported in this role by area offices and dedicated agents located in san francisco  new jersey  antwerp  genoa  hamburg  gothenburg  singapore  hong kong  sydney  tokyo  taipei  seoul  rio de janeiro  shanghai and chennai 
cronos also maintains agency relationships with independent agents around the world who are generally paid a commission based upon revenues generated in the region or the number of containers that are leased from their area 
these agents are located in areas where the volume of cronos business necessitates a presence in the area but is not sufficient to justify a fully functioning cronos office or dedicated agent 
agents provide marketing support to these areas  together with limited operational support 
in addition  cronos relies on the services of approximately independently owned and operated depots around the world to inspect  repair  maintain and store containers while off hire 
the group s area offices authorize all container movements into and out of the depot and supervise all repairs and maintenance performed by the depot 
the group s technical staff set the standards for repair of the cronos fleet throughout the world and monitor the quality of depot repair work 
the depots provide a link to the group s operations  as the redelivery of a container into a depot is the point at which the container is off hired from one customer and repaired  if necessary  and stored in preparation for re leasing to the next customer 
cronos global network is integrated with its computer system and provides hour communication between offices  agents and depots 
the system allows cronos to manage and control its global fleet and provides the responsiveness and flexibility necessary to service the leasing market effectively 
this system is an integral part of cronos service  as it processes information received from the various offices  generates billings to lessees and produces a wide range of reports on all aspects of the group s leasing activities 
the system records the life history of each container  including the length of time on hire  repair costs  as well as port activity trends  leasing activity and equipment data per customer 
the operations and marketing data 
table of contents interfaces with cronos finance and accounting system to provide revenue  cost and asset information to management and staff around the world 
in recent years  cronos and other lessors have developed certain internet based applications 
for cronos  these applications enhance its customer support network by allowing customer access for on line product inquiries 
the group is continuing to develop this side of its business and will introduce other internet options as suitable applications are identified 
competition competition among container leasing companies is based upon several factors  including the location and availability of inventory  lease rates  the type  quality and condition of the containers  the quality and flexibility of the service offered  the availability of suitable financing and the professional relationship between the customer and the lessor 
other factors include the speed with which a leasing company can prepare its containers for lease and the ease with which a lessee believes it can do business with a lessor or its local area office 
not all container leasing companies compete in the same market as some supply only specific container types 
cronos competes with various container leasing companies in the markets in which it conducts business 
the container leasing companies essentially comprises three broad groups 
the first group includes five leasing companies that control almost of the total leased fleet 
the second group  which includes cronos  controls approximately of the total leased fleet 
the third group controlling the remaining comprises the smaller  more specialized fleet operators 
in cronos experience  ocean carriers generally lease containers from several leasing companies in order to minimize dependence on a single supplier 
economies of scale  worldwide operations  diversity  size of fleet and financial strength are increasingly important to the successful operation of a container leasing business 
additionally  as containerization continues to grow  customers may demand more flexibility from leasing companies  particularly regarding the structure of leases  per diem rates  pick up and drop off locations  and the availability of containers 
cronos believes it has created a strategic advantage due to its product and funding diversity  allowing it to develop a wider customer portfolio and lower risk profile 
insurance cronos lease agreements typically require ocean carriers to obtain insurance to cover all risks of physical damage and loss of the equipment under lease  as well as public liability and property damage insurance 
however  the precise nature and amount of the insurance carried by each ocean carrier varies from lessee to lessee 
in addition  cronos has purchased secondary insurance effective in the event that a lessee fails to have adequate primary coverage 
this insurance covers liability arising out of bodily injury and or property damage as a result of the ownership and operation of the containers  as well as insurance against loss or damage to the containers  loss of lease revenue in certain cases and cost of container recovery and repair in the event that a customer goes into bankruptcy 
cronos believes that the nature and amounts of its insurance are customary in the container leasing industry and subject to standard industry deductions and exclusions 
financial information about geographic areas the operations of the group are subject to the fluctuations of world economic and political conditions 
such factors may affect the pattern and levels of world trade 
the group believes that the risks associated with leases to non us customers are generally the same as for leases to us customers 
lease revenue is deemed to be earned based on the physical location of the containers while on lease 
almost all of the group s lease revenue is earned on containers used by its customers in global trade routes 

table of contents accordingly  the group believes that it does not possess discernible geographic reporting segments see additional discussion in operating segments and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
risk factors an investment in the common shares of the company involves a high degree of risk 
the principal risks that attend the company and its business include the following market for common shares 
the market for the company s outstanding common shares is not liquid 
the company s four largest groups of shareholders control approximately of its outstanding common shares 
for  the average daily trading volume in the company s shares was  requirement for third party capital 
cronos is heavily dependent upon third parties to supply it with the capital required for container acquisitions 
such capital may not be available to the group to enable it to expand its fleet of containers 
business economic risks 
the group may be adversely affected by economic and business factors to which the transportation industry in general and the container leasing industry in particular is subject 
these factors  which generally are beyond the control of the group  include economic conditions in the shipping industry  the supply and pricing of new and used containers  fluctuations in world trade demand for leased containers is dependent upon levels of world trade and the supply of containers relative to demand 
future fluctuations in world trade could negatively affect the group s container leasing operations  fluctuations in supply and demand for containers resulting from  among other things  obsolescence  changes in the methods or economics of a particular mode of transportation or changes in governmental regulations or safety standards  fluctuations in shipping lines fleet mix demand for leased containers is largely dependent on the decision of shipping lines to lease containers rather than purchase containers to supplement their own operating fleets 
any significant changes in the composition of the shipping lines leased and owned container fleets could adversely affect the demand for leased containers  fluctuations in inflation  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  increases in maintenance expenses  taxes  insurance costs  third party fees and other expenses attributable to the operation and the maintenance of the containers that cannot be offset by increased lease revenues from the containers  the risk of uninsured losses with respect to the containers or insured losses for which insurance proceeds are inadequate  the effects of strikes  labor disputes and foreign political unrest  and  the risk of terrorist attack involving containers 
competition 
the container leasing industry is highly competitive 
some of cronos competitors have greater financial resources than cronos and may be more capable of offering lower per diem rates on a larger fleet 
in addition  the barriers to entry for the container leasing industry are relatively low 
if the supply of available equipment increased significantly as a result of new companies entering the industry  demand for cronos equipment could be adversely affected 
defaults by lessees 
a default by a shipping line may result in lost revenue for past leasing services and additional operating expenses 
the repossession of containers from shipping lines which have defaulted can prove difficult and  when containers are recovered  the group may not be able to re lease the equipment at comparable rates and at favorable lease terms 

table of contents residual value of containers 
the majority of containers that are at the end of their useful economic life are sold in the non maritime secondary market for use as temporary or permanent storage facilities 
the proceeds realized on the disposition of such containers depends on a variety of factors including the location of the container at the time of disposition  foreign currency exchange rates  the lease market for marine cargo containers  the cost of new containers  the quantity of used containers being supplied to the secondary market  technological advances in container construction and in techniques of ocean transportation  and developments in world trade 
a reduction in container residual values could adversely affect the long term returns generated by containers resulting in reduced profitability and reduced capital availability 
special purpose containers 
special purpose containers include refrigerated containers and tanks 
refrigerated containers are subject to inherent risks of mechanical breakdown and technological obsolescence 
tanks  which can be used to transport hazardous materials  include additional risks of environmental and tort liability 
environmental 
countries that are signatories to the montreal protocol on the environment agreed in november to restrict the use of environmentally destructive refrigerants  banning production but not use of chlorofluorocarbon compounds cfcs beginning in january since then  the environmental impact of cfcs has become increasingly prominent 
on january   it became illegal for environmentally destructive refrigerants to be handled  other than for disposal  in most of the countries that are members of the european union 
all of cronos refrigerated containers purchased since june use non cfc refrigerant gas in the operation and insulation of the containers  although a reduced quantity of cfcs are still used in the container manufacturing process 
at december   of the  refrigerated containers that were owned by the group used the cfc refrigerant gas 
all of the containers are currently on lease and the group will dispose of each unit upon its redelivery 
the replacement refrigerant used in the group s new refrigerated containers may also become subject to similar governmental regulations 
in the past  the group has retrofitted certain refrigerated containers with non cfc refrigerants 
cronos has decided not to retrofit any additional containers 
in the unlikely event that any such further retrofitting expenses should be required  they would not be material to the financial position or results of operations of the group 
the group is subject to other risks in the operation of its business

palatin in the uk courts  secured final judgments against mr 
palatin in this amount plus interest and costs  and  on june   secured an order of sale of the amersham estate from the high court of justice  london 
pursuant to the court s order of sale secured by the group  the amersham estate was sold on january  for million british pounds at the then current exchange rate  approximately 
table of contents million 
the group received million of the proceeds in satisfaction of the final judgments secured against mr 
palatin plus related interest and costs 
the balance of the proceeds the amersham surplus proceeds from the sale of the amersham estate was deposited with the court under the terms of the court s order of sale 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  million of the sales proceeds paid to the group were retained by the group to offset payments previously made to contrin and million was paid to contrin 
an amount of million was retained by the group to cover costs incurred by the group in connection with the foreclosure 
under the settlement agreement  contrin pursued a civil action against mr 
palatin in the uk to recover million  plus interest and costs  for monies diverted to mr 
palatin from contrin in under the settlement agreement  any monies contrin recovered from this action were to be shared between the group and contrin 
the group is currently in litigation with transocean equipment manufacturing and trading limited toemt  as described below 
the liquidator of toemt has secured charging orders against the amersham estate  in satisfaction of default judgments he has secured against mr 
palatin  aggregating in excess of million british pounds 
the liquidator asserted that  under his charging orders  he is entitled to the entire amersham surplus proceeds 
on february   the group  contrin  and the toemt liquidator settled their differences with respect to the allocation of the amersham surplus proceeds  agreeing to an allocation of such proceeds between contrin and the liquidator 
the agreement is subject to approval of the court supervising the toemt liquidation 
under the agreement  contrin will be allocated amersham surplus proceeds in an amount sufficient to fully discharge the group s remaining payment obligations to contrin under the terms of settlement agreement

when the group learned of the insolvency proceeding commenced on behalf of toemt uk in  it set aside the distributions payable with respect to the containers managed for toemt in a separate bank account pending clarification of the proper claimant to the distributions 
the group turned over the set aside distributions amounting to approximately million to the liquidator in december as of december   only nine containers remained in the portfolio of containers managed by the group for toemt 
as part of the february  settlement agreement  described above under the contrin settlement  the group has agreed to purchase the remaining nine containers  effective january  in return  the liquidator of toemt has agreed to drop claims with respect to the turnover of the million and the group s management of containers for toemt 
on december   the liquidator filed his ordinary application in the nature of a complaint in the high court of justice  chancery division  companies court  london  against the company and two of its subsidiaries  cronos containers nv cnv and cronos containers cayman limited cay 
see the k report filed with the sec on january  by the ordinary application  the liquidator seeks a declaration pursuant to section of the uk insolvency act of  as amended insolvency act  that the respondents were knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business of the two toemts with the intent to defraud the creditors of the two toemts and or for other fraudulent purposes  by assisting mr 
palatin in diverting assets from the two toemts to himself  to entities in which he was interested  and or to his associates  otherwise than for proper purposes and otherwise than for full consideration 

table of contents the liquidator alleges that the respondents knowingly were parties to the carrying on of the business of the two toemts to defraud the creditors of the two toemts by reason of the transfer on or about november  to toemt uk of  ordinary shares of the group in consideration of the contribution of assets by toemt uk to the group worth approximately million  which  ordinary shares were then redeemed and or transferred to palatin and or his nominee for no or no proper consideration  the transfer on or about december  to toemt uk of  preference shares worth approximately million which were then transferred to barton holding limited a company allegedly controlled by palatin for no or no proper consideration  and a loan which the liquidator alleges not to have been repaid  the making of various payments amounting to in excess of million between approximately june and february by cnv to third parties  including palatin or entities in which he was interested and or his associates  which payments were made otherwise than for any legitimate commercial purpose or any other purpose of the toemts businesses or interests  the making of improper cash withdrawals amounting to in excess of million  between approximately december and june from toemt uk s bank accounts  with the assistance of cnv  which withdrawals were allegedly for the benefit of palatin and or his wife rather than for any legitimate commercial purpose or other purpose of the toemts businesses or interests  and the diversion between and with the assistance of cnv of toemt uk s container business to toemt isle of man  for no or for no proper consideration 
the liquidator further seeks a declaration pursuant to section of the insolvency act that the respondents and each of them is liable to contribute to the assets of the two toemts the amount of the deficiency as regards the creditors of the two toemts  which the liquidator currently estimates to be at least million  or  alternatively  that the respondents make such contributions to the assets of the two toemts as the court thinks fit 
the liquidator seeks an order from the court that the respondents and each of them pay to the liquidator any sums found to be due to him by reason of the conduct alleged above  plus interest and costs 
service of the liquidator s ordinary application has only recently been made on the group  and accordingly the group has yet to reply to the liquidator s ordinary application

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the group s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial and statistical information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the segment information presented in note to the group s consolidated financial statements relates to the containers in the group s fleet owned by the group itself owned containers or by managed container programs comprising us limited partnership programs  the joint venture program and private container programs 
owned containers include containers held for resale 
all containers  whether owned or managed  are operated as part of a single fleet 
the group has discretion over which ocean carriers  container manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services it deals with 
since the group s agreements with the owners of managed container programs contain leases within the scope of sfas no 
accounting for leases sfas  they are accounted for in the group s financial statements as leases under which the container owners are lessors and the group is lessee 
in  of payments to owners of managed container programs represented agreements which generally provided that the amounts payable to container owners were based upon the rentals to ocean carriers after deducting direct operating expenses and the compensation earned by cronos for managing the equipment 
the remaining of payments to managed container programs represented agreements under which there were fixed payment terms 
minimum lease payments on the agreements with fixed payment terms are included in note c to the group s consolidated financial statements 
gross lease revenue is generated by leasing containers  both owned by the group and by managed container programs  to ocean carriers under operating leases  excluding billings in advance 
these amounts are billed on a monthly basis 
amounts due under master leases are calculated by the group at the end of each month and billed approximately to days thereafter 
amounts due under term leases are set forth in the respective lease agreements and are generally billed and payable on a monthly basis 
changes in gross lease revenue depend primarily upon changes in fleet size  utilization rates and per diem rates 
equipment trading revenue and expenses represent revenue earned from the sale of equipment and the cost of the equipment sold 
in equipment trading transactions  the group enters into an agreement in which it undertakes to supply equipment to a third party 
simultaneously  cronos enters into a separate agreement with a container manufacturer for the acquisition of the equipment 
the group acts as principal in such transactions and accordingly the revenue and expenses are reported gross 
this equipment does not enter the cronos fleet of managed containers 
commissions  fees and other operating income includes acquisition fees relating to the group s managed container programs  income from direct financing leases  fees earned in connection with equipment consultancy and design services  licence fee income earned in connection with the patented cpcs see item business  fees earned on the disposal of used containers in the managed container programs  foreign exchange gains or losses  and miscellaneous other fees and income 
although acquisition fees are generally received in cash at the inception of a managed container program and are non refundable  they are recognized in the statement of income  on a straight line basis over the period of the managed container agreement to which they relate 

table of contents this item is affected by the size of managed programs and the contracted acquisition fee  the quantity of consultancy and design projects undertaken and the profit margins earned in each case  the quantity of cpcs acquired by third parties  the quantity and value of direct financing leases  the proceeds realized on the disposition of used containers and the fee earned in each case and changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other major currencies 
direct operating expenses are direct costs associated with leasing both owned and managed containers 
management analyzes direct operating expenses as a percentage of gross lease revenue 
direct operating expenses may be categorized as follows activity related expenses include agents costs and depot costs  such as repairs  maintenance and handling  inventory related expenses relate to off hire containers and comprise storage and repositioning costs 
these costs are sensitive to the quantity of off hire containers as well as the frequency at which containers are re delivered  legal and other expenses include legal costs related to the recovery of containers  insurance and provisions for doubtful accounts 
payments to managed container programs reflect the amounts due to the owners of containers in managed container programs computed in accordance with the terms of the individual agreements 
selling  general and administrative expenses include all employee and office costs  all professional fees  including audit  legal and other professional fees  business insurance and information technology costs 
segment profit or loss for reported segments  comprises items directly attributable to specific containers in each of the group s operating segments  including gross lease revenue  direct operating expenses  payments to managed container programs  direct financing lease income  container interest expense  container depreciation expense and certain impairment charges 
market overview global container trade experienced strong growth for the third successive year in china has reported significant increases in both its volumes of imports and exports in recent years  and the pace of growth in the volume of trade between china and other countries has been the catalyst to this growth 
during  container leasing companies experienced high levels of demand for new and existing containers 
the following table summarizes the combined utilization of the cronos container fleet for the past three years based on approximate original equipment cost 
utilization at december average utilization during the year the utilization rates for leased containers are currently at historically high levels 
based on the current market for leased containers and predictions from industry analysts that demand will remain strong in  cronos does not expect a significant decline in utilization rates in shipping lines report that freight rates have increased in line with the strong demand on major trade routes  in particular on the asia to us and asia to europe routes 
the majority of the leading shipping lines reported earnings growth during the increased volume of trade has resulted in shortages of both containership and container capacity 
in order to meet the continuing demand  shipping lines have embarked on a major program of new ship building 
the total world order book is at record levels for new containerships that will be delivered between and based on current orders  it is predicted that the capacity of the world s containership fleet will exceed million teu by the end of compared to less than million teu at the beginning of industry analysts are expressing concern that  even if trade growth continues at a sustained rate  the current program of 
table of contents new ship building may create over capacity in the industry once the new containerships that are on order are all in service in any over capacity could result in a reduction in freight rates for shipping lines that in turn could reduce profitability for container leasing companies 
the strong increase in trade volumes has led to increasing port and railroad congestion in certain locations  particularly in the us and europe 
this has increased the turnaround time for containerships and containers and further reduced the amount of available capacity 
container manufacturers increased production output levels in in order to meet the increased container demand 
the current price for a new twenty foot dry cargo container is approximately  compared to a price of  in the latter part of this reflects the combined effect of the increased demand for containers together with increased costs for materials such as steel and wood 
the high level of demand for new container equipment means that there is unlikely to be a major reduction in the price of new containers in the near future and that prices could increase further 
cronos has booked sufficient production space with the container manufacturers to meet all of its current requirements 
in  cronos achieved a increase in the per diem rate for the total container fleet including a increase for dry cargo containers 
per diem rates for new containers increased in line with the increase in new container costs thereby mitigating the adverse effect on profitability caused by the increase in costs 
per diems rates for older containers increased slightly during lease renegotiations 
cronos expects to maintain existing rates or achieve slight increases over the next twelve months 
off hire inventories of containers have declined throughout the world as shipping lines have employed more leased containers to meet the growth in containerised trade 
this decline in inventories has resulted in substantial decreases in storage expenses 
declining inventories have also contributed to an increase in the proceeds realized on the sale of used containers  as fewer containers were available to meet the demand of buyers 
cronos will consider the disposal of off hire inventories in locations where sales prices equal or exceed internal economic targets 
the group did not undertake any major repositioning moves since the first calendar quarter of  due primarily to the shortage of containership capacity 
if suitable carriers can be sourced  the group will reposition off hire equipment from the us east coast in in order to take advantage of the strong demand for containers in the asian trade routes 
the objective of each move is to improve future liquidity  as savings in storage expense and increased future lease revenues should exceed the once off cost of repositioning the containers 
funding the ability of the group to add new equipment to both its owned and managed fleets was one of the main reasons for the improvement in profitability in and in cronos recognizes that its ability to secure funding from third parties in order to expand its container fleet is crucial to its future growth and profitability 
traditionally  cronos has utilized funding from each of its operating segments to expand its container fleet 
in more recent years  growth has been generated by the owned container segment  through debt and capital leases  and by the joint venture program 
each of these sources provides a flexible financing structure with competitive pricing 
owned containers the primary debt facilities include financial covenants that are tested on a quarterly basis and measure minimum tangible net worth  the maximum level of total liabilities to tangible net worth  the maximum level of debt and capital lease obligations to tangible net worth  interest expense coverage and debt service coverage 
at december   the group was in compliance with these covenants 
future compliance with the covenants will depend on the ability of the group to report a minimum level of income before income taxes at the end of each calendar quarter for the preceding twelve month period and to maintain minimum levels of debt service coverage 
the breach of a covenant constitutes an event of default 
under the terms of certain loan facilities  the group is required to hold minimum balances on deposit in restricted cash accounts 
the calculation of the minimum balance is based on projected future interest 
table of contents payments and the balance required will usually increase in line with the loan balances 
the accounts would be utilized in the event that adequate funds were not available to meet the scheduled debt service payments 
at december   the group had million of available container borrowing facilities under which million was outstanding 
in addition  the group had million of unutilized credit facilities that are available  if required  for operating activities 
the primary source of debt funding available to the group is its revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility which the group has utilized to fund the acquisition of new equipment and to refinance existing debt and capital lease facilities 
new equipment is funded by debt and by cash provided by the group 
in september  the revolving credit facility was amended to the effect that the revolving credit period was extended to september   and unless the revolving credit period is extended on that date  the balance outstanding as of september   will be repaid over five years 
the maximum commitment of the lenders under the revolving credit facility is million 
at december   the balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility was million 
the balance of funds available under the revolving credit facility will be utilized to purchase new equipment during the group usually makes monthly repayments under the revolving credit facility and  from time to time  may sell equipment that has been financed by the facility to managed container programs 
any such reductions to the facility may be redrawn to fund the acquisition of new equipment subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions relating to the maintenance of minimum collateral levels 
the revolving credit facility is subject to annual review  and the ability of the group to expand its owned container fleet may be constrained if the revolving credit period is not renewed on an annual basis or if the group cannot provide the cash required for new container acquisitions 
in addition to the revolving credit facility  the group finances the acquisition of equipment with term debt and capital lease facilities 
in  the group secured an additional million of funding under such facilities 
the group enters into annual discussions with lenders in order to increase the amounts available under existing facilities and to add new facilities 
based on current discussions with a number of lenders  the group expects that the amount of funding provided by these lenders will increase in joint venture program the joint venture program has been a major source of funding for the group since its inception in at december  the joint venture program had capacity for an additional million of new equipment 
additional debt and equity funding is subject to annual review 
therefore  the future growth of the joint venture program may be constrained if increased equity and debt funding is not approved on an annual basis or if the group cannot provide the cash required for its equity contribution 
see further discussion in material off balance sheet arrangements  transactions and obligations herein 
private container programs the growth experienced in global container trade in recent years has attracted capital to this segment 
private container programs acquired over million of new container equipment in representing the first significant investment in this segment since the downturn in the container leasing market in based on current negotiations with several private container programs  the group expects that the level of capital invested in new container equipment will grow in see further discussion in material off balance sheet arrangements  transactions and obligations herein 
us limited partnership programs during  the group introduced a new us limited partnership program 
this program is designed to raise a maximum of million of proceeds from limited partners and may also seek to augment the size of its container fleet by financing the purchase of additional equipment under loan facilities secured from commercial lenders 
in  this program acquired million of new container equipment from the group

the total cost of new container acquisitions in was million 
the majority of new dry cargo and refrigerated containers were placed on term lease during this reflects the strong demand from the ocean carriers for this type of lease together with a cronos funding base designed to add more term leases which provide revenue stability and a low cost base 
in  the size of the total fleet grew by 
at december   the owned container fleet included approximately  teu of equipment that was held for resale to managed container programs 
excluding equipment held for resale  the owned container fleet grew by as cronos funded the acquisition of new equipment with the revolving credit facility and capital leases 
the size of the joint venture program fleet increased by reflecting the funding capacity available to the program 
the fleets of both the private container programs and the us limited partnership programs declined as the quantities of equipment disposed at the end of its useful economic life exceeded new container additions 
in  the size of the total fleet grew by 
the owned container fleet grew by as cronos funded the acquisition of new equipment with the revolving credit facility and capital leases 
the fleet of the joint venture program demonstrated strong growth since its inception in september the private container programs fleet declined by due to a lack of any significant new investment in this segment and the disposal of older equipment 
the group operates a diversified fleet of containers 
specialized containers  comprising refrigerated containers  tanks and dry freight specials  accounted for of the cronos owned fleet based on original equipment cost at december  due to their specialized nature  demand for certain of these containers is less likely to be affected by global economic downturns

table of contents per diem rental rates as discussed in market overview  in cronos achieved a increase in the per diem rate for the total fleet of containers in in  the per diem rate for the total fleet of containers declined by 
the combined per diem rate for dry cargo containers declined by in the same period 
this may be attributed to three main factors per diem rental rates decreased in line with the reduction in container prices and interest rates  cronos converted lease agreements with several shipping lines from master to long term leases 
these conversions provided greater revenue stability but at lower lease rates than those payable under master leases  and  cronos initiated new term leases for older equipment  which  while resulting in lower per diem rates  significantly lowered inventory levels 
the following factors should be considered when assessing the impact of a change in per diem rental rates the improvement in utilization that can result from lower per diem rates may have a significant favorable effect on direct operating expenses due to the reduction in storage and other inventory related costs  and  the global economic pressures that cause a change in interest rates may also contribute  to some extent  to a change in lease rates 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview cronos reported net income of million in compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in profitability in can be attributed primarily to growth in global container trade  increased availability of funding for investment in new container production and  in particular  the growth and profitability of the joint venture program  and  income recognized on the recovery of a related party loan note

under the variable payment basis  the amount payable to the managed container program is based on the rentals to the ocean carriers after deducting direct operating expenses and the compensation earned by cronos for managing the equipment 
the level of payments to private container programs with fixed payment terms declined as the group amended the terms of a fixed payment agreement with a container owner in november the amended agreement which was effective from october  is now accounted for as a capital lease obligation 
accordingly  the group recorded an adjustment to container equipment and capital lease of approximately million in the fourth quarter of segment profit on owned containers increased by million to million in glr increased by million reflecting the effect of the increased fleet size and the combined effect of the increase in utilization and per diem rates

the primary activity included a million decline in unrealized exchange gains 
in  the group recorded million of foreign exchange gains that were recognized primarily on euro direct financing lease receivables  an increase of million on the gain recorded on the disposal of fixed assets 
this was due in part to the increased disposal proceeds realised on the sale of equipment at the end of its economic life see discussion in market overview above  and  a million increase in fees earned on the disposal of containers owned by managed container programs that again reflected the strong market for used containers

palatin 
the group had previously established a reserve against the principal balance of million in in december  the group entered into a contract for the sale of the amersham estate 
the order for sale of the amersham estate had been directed by the uk courts so that the proceeds of the sale could be applied to discharge two charging orders that the group had secured against mr

the first charging order secured by cronos was in respect of the remaining balance  and related interest  owed under the loan note by mr 
palatin the second charging order was secured in respect of additional amounts owed by mr 
palatin for which the group had not recorded a receivable 
in december  the group conducted a review of the amount due under the loan note and concluded  that in light of the fact that a 
table of contents contract for the sale of the amersham estate had been executed and that no other creditor of mr 
palatin had secured an equal or better charge over the proceeds from the amersham estate  that the loan note was recoverable 
accordingly  the million provision that had previously been recorded against the principal balance of the loan note was reversed and the receivable reinstated see additional discussion in item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the group also conducted a review of additional proceeds of million expected on the sale of the amersham estate  comprising the second charging order and interest due in connection with the first and second charging orders 
a receivable had not previously been recorded for these items 
the group concluded that as these items represented contingent gains  they should not be recognized until the consummation of the sale of the amersham estate and the settlement of all contingencies requisite to the distribution of funds to the group 
the sale of the amersham estate was completed in january  and the group received million in respect of its charging orders and related interest

equity in earnings of affiliate was million in compared to million in the period september to december these earnings represent the recognition of the cronos share of net income generated by the joint venture program entity that was set up in september of liquidity and capital resources the group uses cash from a number of sources in order to meet its operating and other cash flow commitments 
the primary sources of cash generated by operating activities are gross lease revenue provided by the group s container fleet  fee revenues from its managed container programs and other parties and income earned on equipment trading and direct financing lease transactions 
cash is utilized to meet costs relating to day to day fleet support  payments to managed container programs  selling  general and administrative expenses  interest expense  servicing the current portion of long term borrowings  financing a portion of owned container acquisitions  providing equity contributions to fund of the capital requirements of the joint venture program and making payments to container manufacturers on equipment trading transactions 
cash flows relating to gross lease revenue are largely dependent upon the timely collections of lease revenues from shipping lines 
at december   the amounts due from lessees was million representing an increase of million from the position at december  this increase is entirely due to the increase in the amounts billed for gross lease revenue and disposal proceeds in based on loss experience for the last twelve years  bad debts have approximated of lease revenues 
the group monitors the aging of lease receivables  collections and the credit status of existing and potential customers 
there is always a risk that some shipping lines may experience financial difficulty 
any resultant material increase in the level of bad debts could potentially affect the ability of the group to meet its operating and other commitments 
the group utilizes the proceeds arising from the transfer of equipment held for resale to managed container programs to pay the related amount due to container manufacturers 
at december   the group held million of container equipment for resale to managed container programs  including the joint venture program 
this represented a million increase over the position at december   and was due to a significant increase in the number of containers ordered by the group due to the strong demand for leased containers  an increase in the number of managed container programs seeking to invest in

the sale of the containers by the group to the joint venture program was at book value  which approximated fair value  and therefore did not result in a gain or loss 
cronos intends to use funding from each of its operating segments to finance future fleet growth see funding herein for a discussion of funding for each segment 
the group believes that it has sufficient resources to support its operating and investing activities for the next twelve months 
material off balance sheet arrangements  transactions and obligations joint venture program 
the joint venture program has been a major source of managed container program funding since its inception in and is owned by a subsidiary of the group and owned by a lender to the group  a major international financial services provider 
the purpose of the program is to acquire and lease marine cargo containers to third party lessees with several lenders  including the joint venture owner  providing up to of the cost of acquiring the containers and the joint venture partners each providing one half of the equity to fund the balance of the capital requirements of the program 
the joint venture entity is a bankruptcy remote  special purpose company organized under the laws of bermuda and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in june  the lenders to the joint venture program increased their maximum debt commitment from million to million 
at december   the joint venture program had fixed assets and direct financing leases with a book value of million partly funded by debt of million 
in  it is expected that the joint venture program will acquire an additional million of assets and this investment will require additional equity of approximately million from each of the joint venture partners 
in the twelve months to december   the group earned million as compensation for the management of containers owned by the program  recorded million in equity in earnings of the program and contributed million of capital to the joint venture program 
the group has determined that the joint venture program is within the scope of fin r  however it is not a variable interest entity 
the maximum exposure for cronos to losses as a result of its involvement with the joint venture program at december   was million  representing the total of its equity investment in the joint venture program and the management fees due to cronos from the program 
a further discussion of the group s involvement and transactions with the joint venture program is provided in item business and elsewhere in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations herein 
us limited partnership programs general partner 
the group has equity interests as a general partner in nine us limited partnership programs 
the partnerships are all california limited partnerships managed by cronos capital corp  an indirect subsidiary of the company 
since  seventeen public limited partnerships raised over million from over  investors 
eight of the original seventeen partnerships have now been dissolved 
these general partner investments are accounted for using the equity method 
the objectives of the partnerships are to invest in marine cargo containers  to generate a continuing income for distribution to the limited partners  and to realize the residual value of the container equipment at the end of its useful economic life or upon the dissolution of a partnership 
at december   the us limited partnership programs had total assets of million and total liabilities of million 
the general partner is indemnified by the partnerships for any liabilities suffered by it arising out of its activities as 
table of contents general partner  except in the case of misconduct or negligence 
as limited partnerships  the limited partners may not be assessed for additional capital contributions  and it is possible that the general partner could be liable if the assets of the partnerships are not sufficient to pay their liabilities 
however  the group considers that the risk of any such loss is not material 
therefore  the maximum exposure for cronos to losses as a result of its involvement with the us limited partnership programs at december   was million  representing the total amount due for management fees and other items from the partnerships 
in accordance with fin r  the company has determined that the nine limited partnerships qualify as variable interest entities 
in each case  the company has concluded that neither the company  nor any of its subsidiaries  is the primary beneficiary of any us limited partnership program 
fixed operating leases obligations 
cronos  as lessee  has entered into fixed operating lease contracts for container equipment  computer equipment and office space 
in the rental expense was million of which the fixed operating lease rental expense for container equipment was million 
see contractual obligations herein and note c to the consolidated financial statements for the minimum amount of future lease payments due under fixed operating and other lease contracts 
legal settlement 
on november   cronos and contrin entered into a settlement agreement  resolving litigation which had commenced in august see item legal proceedings and item contractual obligations herein 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  cronos has agreed to make certain future payments to contrin 
in february  the group paid million to contrin  under the terms of the settlement agreement  on the completion of the sale of the amersham estate 
in addition  in february  an agreement was reached between the group  contrin and the toemt liquidator under the terms of which  contrin will be allocated amersham surplus proceeds in an amount sufficient to fully discharge the group s remaining payment obligations to contrin under the settlement agreement 
this agreement is subject to court approval 
primary beneficiary 
in december  the group determined that it was the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in which it held a share 
the group sold million of containers to the variable interest entity in a series of transactions in prior years 
the variable interests of the group in the entity comprised a management fee  that the group earned in return for managing the containers of the entity  a non interest bearing loan note and an option to acquire of the container owning company for one us dollar  the exercise of which was subject to the repayment of certain of the indebtedness of the variable interest entity 
at december   the variable interest entity held cash balances of million  restricted cash of million  container assets of million stated at net book value and debt facilities of million 
the debt is scheduled to be repaid from the cash generated by the container assets 
at december   the variable interest entity held total amounts payable to cronos subsidiaries of million 
such amounts are subordinate to the repayment of the variable interest entity debt 
in february  the group acquired ownership of the variable interest entity 
the debt held by the variable interest entity was restructured on the same date 
in connection with this restructuring  the group issued a guarantee for million of the outstanding debt and the lender cancelled an option to acquire of the variable interest entity 
in addition   warrants to purchase  common shares of the company were cancelled effective february  the warrants  which were exercisable at per share were held by the lender to the variable interest entity under the restructured debt facility 
see the k report filed with the sec on february  agreements with other private container programs early termination options 
at december   approximately based on original equipment cost of the total agreements with private container programs contained early termination options  whereby the container owner may terminate the agreement if certain performance thresholds are not achieved 
at december   approximately based on original equipment cost of the total agreements were eligible for early termination 
cronos believes that early termination of these agreements is unlikely 

table of contents agreements with other private container programs change of control provisions 
at december   approximately based on original equipment cost of the total agreements with private container programs provided that a change in ownership of the group  without the prior consent of the container owner  may constitute an event of default under the agreement 
in substantially all of these agreements  the consent of the container owners may not be unreasonably withheld 
in the event that consent is not obtained  of the total agreements may require the group to transfer possession of the equipment to another equipment manager 
such transfer of possession may result in the group incurring certain costs 
the remaining of the total agreements may require the group to purchase the equipment from the container owners pursuant to the terms of their respective agreements  generally a stipulated percentage determined by age of the equipment of the original cost of the equipment 
a further discussion of the group s involvement and transactions with the private container programs is provided in item business herein 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth the payments by period for cronos contractual obligations 
for a discussion of the group s commitments and contingencies  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period less than more than total year years years years us dollar equivalent  in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations fixed operating lease obligations to managed container programs term lease rental obligations to managed container programs amounts payable to container manufacturers container purchase commitments legal settlement long term debt obligations and capital lease obligations 
the contractual payments detailed by period represent the principal payments due 
at december   the group estimated that the related future interest payments due under long term debt obligations and capital leases were million and million  respectively 
amounts payable to container manufacturers 
cronos has outstanding obligations to pay container manufacturers for containers that were acquired by the group in container purchase commitments 
the group has contracted with container manufacturers for the production of new equipment in term lease rental obligations to managed container programs 
this represents the amounts payable to managed container programs from the minimum term lease rentals receivable in future years from ocean carriers see note and note c to the consolidated financial statements 
no amount will be payable to the managed container program if the ocean carrier fails to pay the future term lease rentals to the group 
critical accounting policies and estimates container equipment depreciable lives 
container equipment is either depreciated over a life of years to a residual value of  or  over a life of years to a residual value of 
management evaluates 
table of contents the period of amortization and residual values to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives and residual values 
container equipment valuation 
the group reviews owned container equipment when changes in circumstances require consideration as to whether the carrying value of the equipment has become impaired  pursuant to guidance established in sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
management considers assets to be impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future projected cash flows from related operations undiscounted and without interest charges 
when impairment is deemed to exist  the assets are written down to fair value or projected discounted cash flows from related operations 
the group evaluates future cash flows and potential impairment of its fleet by container type rather than for each individual container 
therefore  future losses could result for individual container disposals due to various factors including age  condition  suitability for continued leasing  as well as geographic location of the containers where disposed 
deferred taxation 
under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the group is required to record a valuation allowance if realization of a deferred tax asset is unlikely 
substantial weight must be given to recent historical results and near term projections  and management must assess the availability of tax planning strategies that might impact either the need for  or the amount of  any valuation allowance 
based on the recent history of operating losses in its us subsidiaries  the near term outlook and management s evaluation of available tax planning strategies  the group has maintained a valuation allowance for its deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards in the us since as of december   the group s valuation allowance aggregated million 
in the event the group were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset  a reversal of part or all of the valuation allowance would be recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
cronos continually tracks its credit exposure to each customer using specialist third party credit information services and reports prepared by local staff to assess credit quality 
cronos credit committee meets quarterly to analyze the performance of existing customers and to recommend actions to be taken in order to minimize credit risks 
over the last years  bad debts have approximated of gross lease revenues 
based on this information  cronos has calculated an allowance for doubtful accounts comprising specific amounts provided against known probable losses on certain customers plus an additional amount based on loss experience for other customers 
however  the group may be subject to unexpected loss in rental revenue from container lessees that default under their container lease agreements 
goodwill 
on january   the group adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized over that life and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
the annual impairment test uses cash flow discounting techniques to determine the fair value of respective reporting units 
management discounts the projected future net cash flows to be generated by the reporting units based on historic and projected trends for per diem revenues  utilization  container disposal proceeds and funding costs over the expected remaining life of the unit 
although the projected trends are based on historical and current available information  they require subjective management judgment for projections relating to utilization rates  per diem rates  the disposal age of the containers  equipment residual values  cash collections and interest rates 
gross lease revenue managed container programs 
cronos leases equipment to ocean carriers that is owned by its managed container programs 
cronos acts as principal in the lease arrangement with shipping lines based on the characteristics of these transactions in which cronos determines the ocean carrier to which the equipment is leased  sets the applicable lease rental rate  acts as primary obligor in the transaction and collects the lease rentals 
accordingly  cronos reports the resulting lease income on a gross basis  rather than net of its lease costs to the managed container programs 
us limited partnership programs fin r 
the group has determined that the us limited partnership programs are variable interest entities as defined in fin r 
cronos has performed an analysis of the expected losses and the expected residual returns of the us limited partnership programs and determined 
table of contents that the group is not the primary beneficiary of these programs 
although the assumptions used in the calculation of expected losses and expected residual returns are based on historical and current available information  they require subjective management judgment for projections relating to utilization rates  per diem rates  the disposal age of the containers  equipment residual values and cash collections 
new accounting pronouncements in december the fasb issued sfas no 
exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the group does not expect the introduction of sfas to have any impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised share based payment sfas r 
this statement is a revision of fasb statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this statement does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in statement as originally issued and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
this statement does not address the accounting for employee share ownership plans  which are subject to aicpa statement of position employers accounting for employee stock ownership plans 
sfas r is effective for the first interim period beginning after june  and applies to all awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after this date 
the company expects to adopt sfas r from july  management does not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a significant impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the group 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the group s results of operations 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following table sets forth principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for debt and capital lease obligations at december  expected maturity date of debt and capital lease obligations and total thereafter us dollar equivalent  in thousands long term debt and capital lease obligations variable rate us dollar facilities average interest rate variable rate euro facilities average interest rate fixed rate us dollar facilities average interest rate interest rate risk outstanding borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
at december   of total borrowings had floating interest rates 
the group conducted an analysis of borrowings with variable interest rates to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this analysis  the same change was applied to the current balance outstanding  leaving all other factors constant 
it was found that if a increase were applied to market rates  the expected effect would be to reduce annual cash flows by million 
exchange rate risk substantially all purchases of container equipment are in us dollars 
in  approximately of the group s revenues were billed and paid in us dollars and approximately of expenses were incurred and paid in us dollars 
for non us dollar denominated revenues and expenses  the group may enter into foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk 
of the non us dollar expenses  approximately are individually small  unpredictable and were incurred in various denominations 
thus  such amounts are not suitable for cost effective hedging 
as exchange rates are outside of the control of the group  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
by reference to  it is estimated that for every incremental decline in value of the us dollar against various foreign currencies  the effect would be to reduce cash flows by million in any given year
