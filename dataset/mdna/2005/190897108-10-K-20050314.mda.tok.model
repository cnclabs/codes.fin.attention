item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the company is a financial holding company that offers a broad array of financial service products to its target market of small and medium sized businesses and high net worth individuals 
our operating segments include our commercial banking franchise  colorado business bank and arizona business bank  investment banking services  trust and advisory services  and insurance services 
earnings are derived primarily from our net interest income  which is interest income less interest expense  and our noninterest income earned from our fee based business lines and banking service fees  offset by noninterest expense 
as the majority of our assets are interest earning and our liabilities are interest bearing  changes in interest rates impact our net interest margin  the largest component of our operating revenue 
we manage our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our operating results 
we also have focused on reducing our dependency on our net interest margin by increasing our noninterest income 
our company has focused on developing an organization with personnel  management systems and products that will allow us to compete effectively and position us for growth 
the cost of this process relative to our size has been high 
in addition  we have operated with excess capacity during the start up phases of various projects 
as a result  relatively high levels of non interest expense have adversely affected our earnings over the past several years 
salaries and employee benefits comprised most of this overhead category 
however  we believe that our compensation levels have allowed us to recruit and retain a highly qualified management team capable of implementing our business strategies 
we believe our compensation policies  which include the granting of options to purchase common stock to many employees and the offering of an employee share purchase plan  have highly motivated our employees and enhanced our ability to maintain customer loyalty and generate earnings 
for additional discussion on options granted to employees  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
from december   the first complete fiscal year under the current management team  to december   our organization has grown from a bank holding company with two bank locations and total assets of million to a financial services holding company with sixteen bank locations  five fee based businesses and total assets of billion 
certain key metrics of our operating segments as of december  and are as follows colorado business bank arizona business bank investment banking services trust and advisory services insurance corporate support and other consolidated in thousands  except per share data net income loss diluted earnings per share loss total assets net income loss diluted earnings per share loss total assets our commercial banking franchise had strong growth in both net income and earnings per share during as compared to the increase in net income and earnings per share was driven by a million increase in assets related to those segments 
virtually all of this growth was in the form of interest earning assets 
investment banking services also had significant growth during  increasing net income to million from a million net loss in this represents a improvement in earnings per share for that segment 
our insurance segment had a slight decrease in net income and earnings per share during  primarily due to a high volume of life insurance products that were sold during the fourth quarter of corporate support and other had a significant increase in its net loss and loss per share  primarily due to the addition of million in junior subordinated debentures in september and million in may an increase in rates has also increased our interest expenses as all of our junior subordinated debentures are either issued as a variable rate instrument or have been converted to a variable rate instrument through an interest rate swap 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k beginning on page f for a discussion of the segments included in our principal activities and for certain financial information for each segment  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
bank in  the bank continued its strong growth  increasing the loan portfolio by and the deposit portfolio by 
the increase in our loan portfolio was accomplished while also improving our asset quality 
nonperforming assets decreased to of total assets at the end of from at the end of significant strides were made in the arizona market where total assets grew by to million as of the end of this growth was made possible through the recruitment of several senior level bankers and the deployment of our de novo strategy 
the colorado bank also continues to do well  increasing total assets by to billion at the end of  from billion at the end of fee based business lines our fee based business lines have continued to grow  with the additions of acmg and fdl during  which added investment management and wealth transfer planning through the use of life insurance products to the array of financial services offered to our targeted customer base and significantly expanded our employee benefits brokerage services 
our ratio of noninterest income to total operating revenues increased to for compared to in as a result of this continued focus 
led by our investment banking subsidiary  our fee based businesses recorded million in revenue during during  gmb closed transactions finishing the year with a record million in revenue 
this marked the first fiscal year in which all of our fee based business lines were accretive to net income 
we believe that through the combination of our commercial banking franchise and our fee based businesses  we are uniquely situated to service our commercial clients throughout their business lifecycle 
we are able to help our customers grow by providing banking services from our bank franchise  capital planning from gmb  and employee and executive benefits packages from fdl 
we can assist in planning for the future with wealth transfer planning and business succession from fdl 
we are able to protect assets with p c insurance from cobiz insurance 
we can facilitate exit and retirement strategies with mergers and acquisitions m a services from gmb and investment management services with acmg 
we are also able to preserve our customers wealth with trust and fiduciary services from private asset management  investment management services from acmg and wealth transfer services from fdl 
a good example of the synergies of our fee based business lines and banking franchise was the case where a customer of our bank was sold using the services of gmb and the bank provided the senior lending to the new buyers 
after the transaction closed  our client invested the proceeds received with acmg  our investment management business 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
in making those critical accounting estimates  we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the assumptions that could occur  could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibilty of loans and leases in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan and lease portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
we maintain a loan review program independent of the lending function that is designed to reduce and control risk in the lending function 
it includes the monitoring of lending activities with respect to underwriting and processing new loans  preventing insider abuse and timely follow up and corrective action for loans showing signs of deterioration in quality 
we also have a systematic process to evaluate individual loans and pools of loans within our loan and lease portfolio 
we maintain a loan grading system whereby each loan is assigned a grade between and  with representing the highest quality credit  representing a non accrual loan  and representing a loss that will be charged off 
grades are assigned based upon the degree of risk associated with repayment of a loan in the normal course of business pursuant to the original terms 
loans above a certain dollar amount that are adversely graded are reported to the loan committee and the chief credit officer along with current financial information  a collateral analysis and an action plan 
individual loans that are deemed to be impaired are evaluated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses  we analyze the various components of the loan and lease portfolio  including all significant credits  on an individual basis 
when analyzing the adequacy  we segment the loan and lease portfolio into components with similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
possible factors that may impact the allowance for loan and lease losses include  but are not limited to changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices 
changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  including the condition of various market segments 
changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio 
changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff 
changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans  and trends in the volume of non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings  and other loan modifications 
the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations 
the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
refer to the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses section under results of operations below for further discussion on management s methodology 
recoverability of goodwill sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that we evaluate on an annual basis or whenever events occur which may indicate possible impairment whether any portion of our recorded goodwill is impaired 
the recoverability of goodwill is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  goodwill is considered impaired 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using market multiples of comparable entities  including recent transactions  or a combination of market multiples and a discounted cash flow methodology 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires a high degree of subjective management assumption 
discounted cash flow valuation models are utilized that incorporate such variables as revenue growth rates  expense trends  discount rates and terminal values 
based upon an evaluation of key data and market factors  management selects from a range the specific variables to be incorporated into the valuation model 
we conducted our annual evaluation of our reporting units as of december  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  for the period ending december  the estimated fair value of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values and goodwill impairment was not deemed to exist 
the fair value calculations were also tested for sensitivity to reflect reasonable variations  including keeping all other variables constant and reducing projected revenue growth and projected cost savings 
using this sensitivity approach  there was no impairment identified in any reporting unit 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  however  these policies  which are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
financial condition the acquisition of milek insurance services  inc and first capital bank of arizona were accounted for as poolings of interests 
accordingly  the company s financial statements for all years presented in this report give retroactive effect to those acquisitions and combine the assets  liabilities  shareholders equity  income and expenses of the company and the acquired entities at all dates and for all periods covered by the financial statements 
all of the comparative information contained in the following sections of this report also gives retroactive effect to those acquisitions as though the company and the acquired entities had been combined at both dates or for both periods being compared 
the acquisitions of acmg  fdl and gmb were accounted for as purchases and the assets  liabilities  income and expenses of the acquired entities are included in the company s financial statements only for periods following the closing of the acquisitions

the increase in deposits and customer repurchase agreements is attributable  in part  to our continued emphasis on deposit generation as well as a preference for funding sources which offer the most cost effective advantage 
advances from the fhlb were million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in advances from the fhlb is due primarily to the utilization of other funding sources such as customer repurchase agreements which offer more favorable terms 
accrued interest and other liabilities decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease is primarily attributable to an million payable owed to the former shareholders of fdl in accordance with the merger agreement which was paid in the first quarter of this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in the accrual for bonuses and a million increase for earn out payments related to the performance of acmg and gmb for the year

although the provisions of fin no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities precludes the consolidation of the statutory trust  the million in junior subordinated debentures issued by the company to the trust are included in the company s consolidated financial statements

net interest income the largest component of our net income is our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans  leases and investment securities  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the federal open markets committee fomc uses the fed funds rate  which is the interest rate used by banks to lend to each other  to influence interest rates and the economy 
changes in the fed funds rate has a direct correlation on changes in the prime rate  the underlying index for most of the variable rate loans issued by the company 
the prime rate was for the majority of  ending the year at after a rate decrease in november of that year 
the prime rate was further decreased in june to  the lowest rate since during  with the economy expanding the fomc raised the fed funds rate five times in the last six months of the year 
this resulted in a corresponding increase in the prime rate 
the prime rate was at the end of and remained static until june  when it increased basis points to 
during the third quarter of  two additional basis point increases raised the prime rate to 
the fourth quarter of also had two basis point increases  with the prime rate ending the year at 
as the company has historically maintained an asset sensitive profile  meaning that assets generally reprice faster than our liabilities  the increases in the prime rate should have a positive impact on our net interest income and margin 
although the company is still asset sensitive  we implemented an asset liability strategy in to use interest rate swaps to reduce our overall sensitivity 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain information related to our average asset and liability structure and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities

results of operations comparison for the years ended december  and general 
the inclusion of the operations of fdl and acmg  which were acquired in april  and were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  contributed to the increases in non interest income and non interest expense as there was a full twelve months of operations in and only nine months of operations in in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company s financial statements prior to the acquisition dates have not been restated to reflect the assets or earnings of fdl and acmg 
earnings performance 
net earnings available to common shareholders were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of million after provision for loan and lease losses  and an increase in non interest income of million  offset by a million increase in non interest expense 
reported earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for were  versus for the same period a year ago 
return on average assets was for  compared to in return on average common shareholders equity was for the year ended december   versus for the year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan and lease losses was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared with the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in interest earning assets due to the increase in investments and loans  partially offset by a decrease in the average yield in compared to although rates began to increase in the latter part of  the company s net interest margin is still being impacted by lower yielding assets added to the balance sheet during and  a time when rates were significantly depressed 
the decrease in the yield on loans reflects the increase in repricing of existing loans at lower rates 
yields on our interest earning assets declined by basis points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  yields paid on interest bearing liabilities dropped by basis points during this same period 
the overall result was a net interest margin of for the year ended december   down from for the year ended december  see the section captioned net interest income above for an analysis of our average interest earning assets and liabilities  as well as the impact on our net interest income due to balance sheet volume and interest rate changes 
in order to reduce our asset sensitivity  the company implemented an asset liability strategy to use interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate loans indexed to prime 
during  the company entered into seven interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million 
the swaps amortize over a four year period  with one third of the notional balance amortizing in year two  one third in year three and the remaining one third in year four 
the company receives a fixed rate and pays a variable rate based on the notional amounts 
during  the company also entered into an interest rate swap to convert its million of fixed rate junior subordinated debentures into a variable rate 
under the terms of these swaps  as of the end of  the company pays a weighted average rate of and receives 
during  the company recognized an increase in net interest income of million due to the interest rate swaps 
as the economy is currently in a rising rate environment  future rate increases by the fomc could result in the weighted average rate paid by the company to exceed the fixed rate we receive 
provision and allowance for loan and lease losses 
the provision for loan and lease losses increased by  to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to the increase in total loans and leases outstanding and is not reflective of a deterioration of credit quality 
key indicators of asset quality have remained favorable as net charge offs and non performing loans and leases have actually decreased in compared to  while average outstanding loan amounts have increased to billion for  up from million for at december   the allowance for loan and lease losses amounted to million  or of total loans and leases compared to of total loans at december  noninterest income 
the following table presents noninterest income for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands amount noninterest income deposit service charges other loan fees trust and advisory income insurance revenue investment banking revenue other income gain on sale of other assets and securities total noninterest income the increase in trust and advisory income was primarily due to an increase in the market value of assets under management  due to both market increases and the number of clients represented by our investment management group 
acmg s revenues are dependent upon the market value of their assets under management 
as the equity markets have shown improvement  acmg s income has increased each quarter since we acquired them in discretionary assets under management increased to million at the end of  from million at the end of in addition  since the acquisition  acmg s client base has increased 
the year also included a full months of operations for acmg  while only included nine months 
the increase in insurance revenue was primarily due to an increase in contingent commissions  employee benefit consulting commissions  and p c commissions  offset by a decrease in life insurance commissions 
contingent commissions are commissions received from insurance carriers related to policy renewals and the loss performance of the underwritten policies 
the company earned million in contingent commissions during  compared to million in the company s employee benefits consulting division increased revenue in to million from million in in june  the company acquired a small employee benefit consulting book of business which contributed to this increase 
the company also realized a increase in revenues earned from its p c division which totaled million in compared to million in the year included a full months of operations for fdl  while only included nine months 
fdl s revenue during was million compared to million in a significant portion of fdl s revenue is transactional in nature  generated by the sale of life insurance policies where a considerable amount is earned when the policy is signed and a smaller amount is earned in subsequent years as the policy is renewed 
during  million was earned from this revenue stream compared to million in the increase in investment banking revenue during was due to a higher number of transactions closed during the year as compared to in  gmb closed mergers and acquisitions m a and five financial advisory transactions 
conversely  in two m a and two financial advisory transactions were closed 
the revenue earned from investment banking during was higher than any other year since we acquired gmb in although we continue to feel optimistic about the outlook for the m a market and the gmb business model  we do not expect that gmb will replicate the operating results achieved in the increase in other income is primarily due to a million increase in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and a million increase in foreign exchange fees 
the majority of our bank owned life insurance was purchased in the latter part of and during  thus providing a larger average balance on which to earn income during the increase in foreign exchange fees is due to the enhancement of our international products during during  we rebalanced our investment portfolio by selling certain securities and purchasing other securities 
all of the securities sold were in a gain position  that did not impact the company s accounting for securities held in a loss position under current accounting guidance or the proposed guidance in eitf the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the increase in gains on sales of other assets and securities is primarily due to the sale of available for sale mortgage backed securities 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for includes the operations or acmg and fdl for the full months while only includes the nine months subsequent to the acquisition dates 
the following table presents noninterest expense for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands amount noninterest expenses salaries and employee benefits occupancy expenses  premises and equipment amortization of intangibles other operating expenses total noninterest expenses during our efficiency ratio improved to from for the comparable period in the efficiency ratio is a measure of the company s overhead  measuring the percentage of each dollar of income that is paid in operating expenses 
contributing to the overall increase in noninterest expense were the acquisitions of acmg and fdl as previously noted 
salaries and employee benefits have increased due to higher staffing levels to accommodate the growth of the franchise  annual merit increases  and increases in health insurance and other benefit costs 
there was also a substantial increase in the bonuses paid from our investment banking subsidiary to match the increase in their operating results 
in recognition of our exceptional operating results  the board of directors approved a special one time bonus to all of our employees during the company also introduced a supplemental employee retirement plan for certain key executives during occupancy costs have increased due to the aforementioned acquisitions  the additions of the northwest and camelback locations during  and the inclusion of the tempe and northeast bank locations for their first full year 
in addition  the company is relocating a large part of its operations group from the denver headquarters building to a nearby location in order to accommodate our information technology it infrastructure and support operations growth 
an ongoing commitment to providing the highest level of technological service to our customers has also increased our depreciation and maintenance expense 
other operating expenses have increased primarily in the areas of marketing  correspondent bank and federal reserve charges  occ assessments  and miscellaneous operational losses 
marketing costs continue to increase as a direct result of our growth initiatives as we attempt to increase our loan and deposit bases and grow our fee based business lines 
our correspondent bank and federal reserve charges continue to increase as we grow and service high volume customers  which increases our correspondent and federal reserve activity 
professional services have increased as we implement and explore new it initiatives  as well as an increase in external accountant and consulting fees  which is partly due to the implementations of the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of our operational losses are generally lower than industry average  but in we recognized a loss related to a bank robbery for which we recognized a loss equal to our insurance deductible 
federal income taxes 
the provision for income taxes totaled million during  compared to million during the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
comparison for the years ended december  and general 
the inclusion of the accounts of fdl and acmg  which were acquired in april and accounted for under the purchase method of accounting contributed to the increases in non interest income and non interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company s financial statements prior to the acquisition dates have not been restated to reflect the assets or earnings of fdl and acmg

net interest income before provision for loan and lease losses was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared with the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in interest earning assets due to the increase in investments and loans  partially offset by a decrease in the average yield in compared to the bank has historically maintained an asset sensitive interest rate profile  and was negatively impacted by the decreasing rate environment of the past few years as rates on interest earning assets decreased more quickly than rates on interest bearing liabilities 
the basis point decrease in the prime rate during the fourth quarter of and the basis point decrease that occurred towards the end of the second quarter of impacted our net interest income 
mitigating the decreases in the prime rate was an interest rate swap the company entered into in january of the swap effectively converted our junior subordinated debentures into a variable rate liability based on a spread over three month libor  for a combined rate of for the quarter ending december  and for the year then ended 
yields on our interest earning assets declined by basis points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  yields paid on interest bearing liabilities dropped by basis points during this same period 
the overall result was a net interest margin of for the year ended december   down slightly from for the year ended december  provision and allowance for loan and lease losses 
the provision for loan and lease losses increased by  to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to the increase in total loans and leases outstanding and is not reflective of a deterioration of credit quality

the following table presents noninterest income for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands amount noninterest income deposit service charges operating lease income other loan fees trust and advisory income insurance revenue investment banking revenue other income gain loss on sale of other assets total noninterest income the increase in insurance revenue was driven by the acquisition of fdl  which generated million in revenue during a significant portion of fdl s revenue is considered transactional revenue  generated by the sale of life insurance policies where a significant amount is earned when the policy is signed 
during  million was earned from this revenue stream 
the revenue earned from the sale of insurance policies in is not necessarily indicative of future results 
the increase in trust and advisory income was primarily attributable to the acquisition of acmg  which generated million in investment advisory fees for the period subsequent to the acquisition date 
acmg s revenues are dependent upon the market value of their assets under management 
as the equity markets improved during the latter part of  acmg s income has increased 
as of december   the company had million in assets under management  up from million in due to the acquisition of acmg 
the increases in noninterest income from insurance revenue and trust and advisory fees were offset by a million net decrease in other fee based areas 
investment banking revenues were down million in compared to while the pipeline of engagements for gmb was steady  only two engagements were successfully closed during however  the number of clients under engagement increased at december   compared to december  operating lease income has decreased  in to  compared to  in this is a result of concentrating our marketing efforts in on originating loans  rather than leases 
we focused on generating loans  as opposed to leases  because the interest spreads on loans have been more favorable 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in service charges related to the growth in our customer and deposit base and the impact of our treasury management sales efforts 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for includes the operations or acmg and fdl for the nine months of subsequent to the acquisition dates 
the following table presents noninterest expense for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands amount noninterest expenses salaries and employee benefits occupancy expenses  premises and equipment depreciation on leases amortization of intangibles other operating expenses total other expense during our efficiency ratio increased to from for the comparable period in in general  the increase in noninterest expense was due to the acquisitions as previously noted  and overall growth during the year 
salary and benefits increased due to higher staffing levels to accommodate the growth of the franchise  annual merit increases  and increases in health insurance and other benefit costs 
occupancy costs increased due to the aforementioned acquisitions  the additions of the tempe and northeast bank branches during  and the inclusion of the scottsdale branch for its first full year 
an ongoing commitment to providing the highest level of technological service to our customers increased our depreciation and maintenance expense 
other operating expenses increased primarily in the areas of marketing  correspondent bank and federal reserve charges  fdic and occ assessments  professional services and fees paid to our board of directors 
the increase in marketing is a direct result of our growth initiatives as we concentrated on increasing our loan and deposit bases 
our correspondent bank and federal reserve charges continue to increase as we grow and service high volume customers  which increases our correspondent and federal reserve activity 
professional services increased as we implemented and explored new it initiatives  as well as an increase in external accountant fees 
during  we also amended our fee structure for the amounts paid to our board of directors to align the fees with the industry 
federal income taxes 
the provision for income taxes totaled million during  compared to million during the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity management objective is to ensure our ability to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to allow us to sustain our operations 
historically  our primary source of funds has been customer deposits 
scheduled loan and lease repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan and lease prepayments which are influenced by fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  returns available on other investments  competition  economic conditions  and other factors are relatively unstable 
in addition  the company has commitments to extend credit under lines of credit and stand by letters of credit 
the company has also committed to investing in certain partnerships 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on these commitments 
borrowings may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity or repricing intervals of assets 
the company is required under federal banking regulations to maintain sufficient reserves to fund deposit withdrawals  loan commitments  and expenses 
we monitor our cash position on a daily basis in order to meet these requirements 
we use various forms of short term borrowings for cash management and liquidity purposes on a limited basis 
these forms of borrowings include federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  the state of colorado treasury s time deposit program and borrowings from the fhlb 
the bank has approved federal funds purchase lines with seven other banks with an aggregate credit line of million as well as credit lines of million with three firms to transact repurchase agreements 
in addition  the bank may apply for up to million of state of colorado time deposits 
the bank also has a line of credit from the fhlb that is limited by the amount of eligible collateral available to secure the borrowings 
borrowings under the fhlb line are required to be secured by unpledged securities and qualifying loans 
at december   we had million in unpledged securities and qualifying loans available to collateralize fhlb borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
at the holding company level  our primary source of funds are dividends paid from the bank and our fee based business lines  management fees assessed to the bank and the fee based business lines  proceeds from the issuance of common stock and other capital markets activity 
the main use of this liquidity is the quarterly payment of dividends on our common stock  quarterly interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures  payments for mergers and acquisitions activity including potential earn out payments  and payments for the salaries and benefits for the employees of the holding company 
the approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency is required prior to the declaration of any dividend by the bank if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of provides that the bank cannot pay a dividend if it will cause the bank to be undercapitalized 
the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends upon the availability of dividends from the bank and earnings from its fee based businesses  and upon the company s compliance with the capital adequacy guidelines of the frb 
see item business supervision and regulation and note of notes to consolidated financial statements of cobiz for an analysis of the compliance of the bank and cobiz with applicable capital adequacy guidelines 
maintaining adequate capital levels is integral to providing stability to the company  resources to achieve the company s growth objectives  and returns to the shareholders in the form of dividends 
in addition  as described above in business the holding company capital adequacy and business the bank capital adequacy  federal regulations establish minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of the company and the bank 
we continually monitor existing and alternative financing sources to support our capital and liquidity needs  including but not limited to  debt issuance  common stock issuance and deposit funding sources 
based on our current financial condition and our results of operations  we believe that the company will be able to raise adequate capital through one of these financing sources  as needed 
our fixed rate junior subordinated debentures issued in become callable at par in june of the company is currently evaluating alternative funding sources  and it is likely that these debentures will be called 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap to convert these fixed rate debentures into a variable rate that is accounted for as a fair value hedge using the short cut treatment allowed under sfas  as amended 
to cancel this swap  the company will have to pay a settlement amount to its counterparty 
as of december   the fair value of the swap  which is a liability to the company  is million 
the company has issued a total of million of trust preferred securities through statutory trusts that are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
although the accounts of the trusts are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements  million of the million in trust preferred securities issued by the trusts are included in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes as allowed by the federal reserve board 
on february  the federal reserve board finalized a rule that would continue to allow the inclusion of trust preferred securities issued by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts in tier capital  but with stricter quantitative and qualitative standards 
under the rule  after a transition period ending on march   the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements would be limited to of tier capital elements  net of goodwill that has been reduced by any associated deferred tax liability 
the amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit could be included in tier capital  subject to restrictions 
based on the final rule  the company s allowable trust preferred securities in tier capital would decrease to million if it had been in effect at december  the additional amount excluded from tier capital would be included in tier capital and the company would still be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions 
comparison for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to an increase in cash received from net interest income of million and an increase in cash received from non interest income of million  offset by higher operating expenses 
during  our average interest earning assets increased by million  while our interest bearing liabilities only increased by million 
the net increase in our interest earning assets helped drive our cash receipts from net interest income 
our cash receipts from our fee based business lines increased substantially  primarily due to the m a transactions closed by gmb 
our cash uses for operations continue to grow as we deploy our de novo strategy and grow our fee based business lines 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily related to an increase in net loan and lease originations and repayments million due to the growth of the company  net additions to the investment portfolio  primarily mortgage backed securities million that the company uses to manage liquidity and interest rate risk  and an increase in cash paid for acquisitions due to the earn out payments related to acmg and fdl million 
these increases were offset by a decrease in the cash paid for bank owned life insurance during as compared to million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributed to an increase in cash inflows from total deposits million and the increase in the issuance of junior subordinated debentures million in as compared to these increases were offset by a decrease in cash flows in wholesale borrowings million including fed funds purchased  repurchase agreements and advances from the federal home loan bank during the year ended as compared to the company grew its deposit base during  allowing us to reduce the level of wholesale borrowing fed funds purchased  fhlb advances and street repurchase agreements during  the issuance of the junior subordinated debentures in may  was part of a strategy to obtain funds with a low cost of capital to finance our acquisitions and to provide capital to the bank 
comparison for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the earnings of the bank and earnings from the acquisition of fdl  offset by funding provided to gmb for its operational cash uses 
the company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement during january that significantly reduced our cash outlays on our fixed rate junior subordinated debentures 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to a significant net addition to the investment portfolio  primarily mortgage backed securities million that the company uses to manage liquidity and interest rate risk  the purchase of bank owned life insurance million to offset future benefit costs  the acquisiti ons of acmg and fdl million and million  respectively  and an increase in net loan and lease originations and repayments million due to the growth of the company 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributed to an increase in net advances from the federal home loan bank million  an increase in cash flows from securities sold under agreement to repurchase million and the issuance of junior subordinated debentures million  offset by reduced cash inflows from total deposits and federal funds purchased million during the year ended as compared to although the company grew its deposit base during  it did not increase at the same level as in  primarily due to the soft economy in colorado 
as a result  the company increased its level of wholesale borrowing fhlb advances and street repurchase agreements during the issuance of the junior subordinated debentures in september  was part of a strategy to obtain funds with a low cost of capital to finance our acquisitions and to provide capital to the bank

long term obligations are comprised of the junior subordinated debentures described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has also committed to make additional earn out payments to the former shareholders of acmg  gmb and fdl based on earnings performance 
other than the acmg and gmb earn out payments for included in short term obligations  all other future earn out payments have been excluded from the above table as the amount of future payments to be made  if any  are unknown

these financial instruments include legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
credit risk is the principal risk associated with these instruments 
the contractual amounts of these instruments represent the amount of credit risk should the instruments be fully drawn upon and the customer defaults 
to control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit  the company uses the same credit quality  collateral policies  and monitoring controls in making commitments and letters of credit as it does with its lending activities 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation 
legally binding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit obligate the company to meet certain financial obligations of its customers  if  under the contractual terms of the agreement  the customers are unable to do so 
the financial standby letters of credit issued by the company are irrevocable 
payment is only guaranteed under these letters of credit upon the borrower s failure to perform its obligations to the beneficiary 
approximately million of total commitments at december  represent commitments to extend credit at fixed rates of interest  which exposes the company to some degree of interest rate risk 
the company has also entered into interest rate swap agreements under which it is required to either receive cash or pay cash to a counterparty depending on changes in interest rates 
the interest rate swaps are carried at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
because the interest rate swaps recorded on the balance sheet at december  do not represent amounts that will ultimately be received or paid under the contract  they are excluded from the table above 
lending activities general 
we provide a broad range of commercial and retail lending services  including commercial loans  commercial and residential real estate construction loans  commercial and residential real estate mortgage loans  consumer loans  revolving lines of credit and equipment lease financing  including both operating and direct financing leases 
our primary lending focus is commercial and real estate lending to small and medium sized businesses with annual sales of million to million and businesses and individuals with borrowing requirements of  to million 
at december   substantially all of our outstanding loans and leases were to customers within colorado and arizona 
interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk  maturity  underwriting and servicing costs  principal amount  and extent of other banking relationships with the customer  and are further subject to competitive pressures  money market rates  availability of funds  and government regulations 
see net interest income for an analysis of the interest rates on our loans 
credit procedures and review 
we address credit risk through internal credit policies and procedures  including underwriting criteria  officer and customer lending limits  a multi layered loan approval process for larger loans  periodic document examination  justification for any exceptions to credit policies  loan review and concentration monitoring 
in addition  we provide ongoing loan officer training and review 
we have a continuous loan review process designed to promote early identification of credit quality problems  assisted by a dedicated chief credit officer 
during  the company established a new senior credit officer position to oversee the real estate portfolio 
all loan officers are charged with the responsibility of reviewing  no less frequently than monthly  all past due loans in their respective portfolios 
in addition  each of the loan officers establishes a watch list of loans to be reviewed by the boards of directors of the bank and cobiz 
the loan and lease portfolio is also monitored regularly by a loan review officer who reports to the president of the company but submits reports directly to the audit committee of the boards of directors 
composition of loan and lease portfolio 
the following table sets forth the composition of our loan and lease portfolio at the dates indicated

at december   our individual legal lending limit was million 
our board of directors has established an internal lending limit of million for normal credit extensions and million for the highest rated credit types 
to accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed our internal lending limits and to address portfolio concentration concerns  we sell loan participations to outside participants 
at december  and  the outstanding balances of loan participations sold by us were million and million  respectively 
we have retained servicing rights on all loan participations sold 
at december  and  we had loan participations purchased from other banks totaling million and million  respectively 
we use the same analysis in deciding whether or not to purchase a participation in a loan as we would in deciding whether to originate the same loan 
due to the nature of our business as a commercial banking institution  our lending relationships are typically larger than those of a retail bank 
the following table describes the number of relationships and the percentage of the dollar value of the loan portfolio by the size of the credit relationship 
the majority of the loan relationships exceeding million are in our real estate and construction portfolios 
credit relationships number of relationships of loan portfolio number of relationships of loan portfolio greater than million million to million million to million million to million less than million in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit 
we apply the same credit standards to these commitments as we apply to our other lending activities and have included these commitments in our lending risk evaluations 
our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our commitments 
commercial loans 
commercial lending consists of loans to small and medium sized businesses in a wide variety of industries 
the bank s areas of emphasis in commercial lending include  but are not limited to  loans to wholesalers  manufacturers  construction and business services companies 
we provide a broad range of commercial loans  including lines of credit for working capital purposes and term loans for the acquisition of equipment and other purposes 
commercial loans are generally collateralized by inventory  accounts receivable  equipment  real estate and other commercial assets and may be supported by other credit enhancements such as personal guarantees 
however  where warranted by the overall financial condition of the borrower  loans may be unsecured and based on the cash flow of the business 
terms of commercial loans generally range from one to five years  and the majority of such loans have floating interest rates 
the following table summarizes the company s commercial loan portfolio  segregated by standard industrial classification code sic 
commercial loans by sic code in thousands balance of commercial loan portfolio balance of commercial loan portfolio finance and insurance services construction wholesale trade manufacturing retail trade all other real estate mortgage loans 
real estate mortgage loans include various types of loans for which we hold real property as collateral 
we generally restrict commercial real estate lending activity to owner occupied properties or to investor properties that are owned by customers with which we have a current banking relationship 
we make commercial real estate loans at both fixed and floating interest rates  with maturities generally ranging from five to twenty years 
the bank s underwriting standards generally require that a commercial real estate loan not exceed of the appraised value of the property securing the loan 
in addition  we originate small business administration loans sba on owner occupied properties with maturities of up to years in which the sba allows for financing of up to of the project cost and takes a security position that is subordinated to us  as well as us department of agriculture usda rural development loans 
as of december   approximately of our outstanding loans were guaranteed by the sba and were guaranteed by the usda 
we also originate residential mortgage loans on a limited basis as a service to our preferred customers 
the primary risks of real estate mortgage loans include the borrower s inability to pay  material decreases in the value of the real estate that is being held as collateral and significant increases in interest rates  which may make the real estate mortgage loan unprofitable 
we do not actively seek permanent mortgage loans for our own portfolio  but  rather  syndicate such loans to other financial institutions 
however  for those permanent mortgage loans that are extended  we attempt to apply conservative loan to value ratios and obtain personal guarantees and generally require a strong history of debt servicing capability and fully amortized terms of years or less

we originate loans to finance construction projects involving one to four family residences 
we provide financing to residential developers that we believe have demonstrated a favorable record of accurately projecting completion dates and budgeting expenses 
we provide loans for the construction of both pre sold projects and projects built prior to the location of a specific buyer  although loans for projects built prior to the identification of a specific buyer are provided on a more selective basis 
residential construction loans are due upon the sale of the completed project and are generally collateralized by first liens on the real estate and have floating interest rates 
in addition  these loans are generally secured by personal guarantees to provide an additional source of repayment 
we generally require a permanent financing commitment be in place before we make a residential construction loan 
moreover  we generally monitor construction draws monthly and inspect property to ensure that construction is progressing as projected 
our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of the loan be no more than of the appraised value of the completed construction project 
values are determined only by approved independent appraisers 
we also originate loans to finance the construction of multi family  office  industrial and tax credit projects 
these projects are predominantly owned by the user of the property or are sponsored by financially strong developers who maintain an ongoing banking relationship with us 
our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of these loans be no more than of the appraised value 
values are determined only by approved independent appraisers 
we selectively provide loans for the acquisition and development of land for residential building projects by financially strong developers who maintain an ongoing banking relationship with us 
for this category of loans  our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of these loans be no more than of the appraised value 
values are determined only by approved independent appraisers 
consumer loans 
we provide a broad range of consumer loans to customers  including personal lines of credit  home equity loans and automobile loans 
in order to improve customer service  continuity and customer retention  the same loan officer often services the banking relationships of both the business and business owners or management 
leases 
we provide lease financing as a complement to our other lending services 
these leases are structured as either operating or direct financing leases  under which we retain title to the leased assets as security for payment 
only direct financing leases are included in our loan and lease portfolio 
operating leases are reported as investment in operating leases 
nonperforming assets our nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans and leases  restructured loans and leases  past due loans and leases  and other real estate owned 
nonaccrual loans are those loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
impaired loans are defined as loans for which  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement all of which were on a non accrual basis 
the following table sets forth information with respect to these assets at the dates indicated 
at december  in thousands nonperforming loans and leases loans and leases days or more delinquent and still accruing interest nonaccrual loans and leases total nonperforming loans and leases repossessed assets total nonperforming assets allowance for loan and lease losses ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of nonperforming loans and leases to total loans and leases ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans and leases accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan or lease when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan or lease is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days past due 
when a loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status  all accrued and unpaid interest on the loan or lease is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan or lease balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when the issues relating to a nonaccrual loan or lease are finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan or lease  which may necessitate additional charges to earnings 
restructured loans and leases are those for which concessions  including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to the borrower  or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans and leases is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
the additional interest income that would have been recognized for the years ended december    and if our nonaccrual and restructured loans and leases had been current in accordance with their original terms  and the interest income on nonaccrual and restructured loans and leases actually included in our net income for such periods  was not material 
repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers and are carried at the lesser of fair market value less anticipated selling costs or the balance of the related loan 
in addition to the nonperforming assets described above  at december   we had loan and lease relationships considered by management to be potential problem loans or leases  with outstanding principal totaling approximately million 
a potential problem loan or lease is one as to which management has concerns about the borrower s future performance under the terms of the loan or lease contract 
for our protection  management monitors these loans and leases closely 
these loans and leases are current as to the principal and interest and  accordingly  are not included in the nonperforming asset categories 
however  further deterioration may result in the loan or lease being classified as nonperforming 
the level of potential problem loans and leases is factored into the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
analysis of allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for loan and lease losses  based on various factors affecting the loan and lease portfolio  including a review of problem loans and leases  business conditions  historical loss experience  evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral  and holding and disposal costs 
the allowance is increased by additional charges to operating income and reduced by loans and leases charged off  net of recoveries 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses for the periods indicated 
for the year ended december  in thousands balance of allowance for loan and lease losses at beginning of period charge offs commercial real estate mortgage consumer direct financing leases total charge offs recoveries commercial real estate mortgage consumer direct financing leases total recoveries net charge offs provisions for loan and lease losses charged to operations balance of allowance for loan and lease losses at end of period ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases average loans and leases outstanding during the period additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses  which are charged as expenses on our income statement  are made periodically to maintain the allowance at the appropriate level  based on our analysis of the potential risk in the loan and lease portfolio 
loans and leases charged off  net of amounts recovered from such loans and leases  reduce the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the amount of the allowance is a function of the levels of loans and leases outstanding  the level of non performing loans and leases  historical loan and lease loss experience  the amount of loan and lease losses actually charged against the reserve during a given period  and current and anticipated economic conditions 
at december   the allowance for loan and lease losses equaled of total loans and leases 
federal regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  review our loans and leases and allowance for loan and lease losses 
we believe that our allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to cover anticipated loan and lease losses 
however  management may determine a need to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses  or regulators  when reviewing the bank s loan and lease portfolio in the future  may request the bank to increase such allowance 
either of these events could adversely affect our earnings 
further  there can be no assurance that our actual loan and lease losses will not exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the following table sets forth the allowance for loan and lease losses by category to the extent specific allocations have been determined relative to particular categories of loans or leases 
at december  in thousands amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans amount of allowance loans in category as a of total gross loans commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer direct financing leases unallocated total the unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to cover loss exposure related to potential problem loans or leases for which no specific allocation has been estimated 
management attempts to quantify  on a quarterly basis  unidentified loss exposure in our overall portfolio 
we continually analyze historical loss trends in assessing the unallocated portion of the allowance 
general economic conditions and commercial trends influence the level of the unallocated portion of the allowance  as well as growth of the loan and lease portfolio 
we also specifically monitor concentrations of real estate and large credits 
we believe that any allocation of the allowance into categories creates an appearance of precision that does not exist 
the allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts  by loan or lease classification  to be charged to the allowance 
we believe that the table is a useful device for assessing the adequacy of the allowance as a whole 
the table has been derived in part by applying historical loan and lease loss ratios to both internally classified loans and leases and the portfolio as a whole in determining the allocation 
the allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans and leases 
investments our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of securities rated aaa or better by various nationally recognized rating agencies  with the majority of the portfolio either maturing or repricing within a one to five year period 
our practice is to purchase primarily us treasury and us government agency backed securities 
our investment strategies are reviewed in monthly meetings of the asset and liability management committee 
our mortgage backed securities are typically classified as available for sale 
our goals with respect to our securities portfolio are to maximize safety and soundness 
provide adequate liquidity 
maximize rate of return within the constraints of applicable liquidity requirements 
complement asset liability management strategies

we offer a variety of accounts for depositors  which are designed to attract both short and long term deposits 
these accounts include certificates of deposit  savings accounts  money market accounts  checking and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts  and individual retirement accounts 
at december   million  or  of our deposits were noninterest bearing deposits 
we believe we receive a large amount of noninterest bearing deposits because we provide customers with the option of paying for treasury management services in cash or by maintaining additional noninterest bearing account balances 
however  since proposed changes in united states legislation would allow for the payment of interest on commercial accounts  there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to maintain such a high level of noninterest bearing deposits 
interest bearing accounts earn interest at rates based on competitive market factors and our desire to increase or decrease certain types of maturities or deposits

unlike most retail or manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution such as the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  the impact of interest rates on a financial institution s performance is generally greater than the impact of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or to the same extent  as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as inflation 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
sfas r specifies that the fair value of an employee stock option must be based on an observable market price of an option with the same or similar terms and conditions if one is available or  if an observable market price is not available  the fair value must be estimated using a valuation technique that is applied in a manner consistent with the fair value measurement objective and the other requirements of the statement  is based on established principles of financial economic theory and generally applied to that field  and reflects all substantive characteristics of the instrument 
sfas r permits entities to use any option pricing model that meets the fair value objective in the statement 
sfas r is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  as of the effective date  the company will apply the statement using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  cancelled  or repurchased after that date and the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated for either recognition or pro forma disclosures under sfas currently  the company offers several stock option plans and an employee share purchase plan that will be impacted by this statement 
the quantitative impact of this statement on the company will depend upon various factors  among them being the company s future compensation strategy which is currently being evaluated 
in march  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus regarding eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the consensus provides guidance for evaluating whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires certain disclosures for equity investments accounted for under the cost method 
on september   the fasb board issued staff position fsp no 
eitf which delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs of issue during the delay  the guidance in sec staff accounting bulletin topic m other than temporary impairment of certain investments in debt and equity securities and paragraph of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  are the standards for determining other than temporary impairments 
the company does not expect the requirements of eitf to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management asset liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of repricing assets compared to liabilities 
it is our objective to generate stable growth in net interest income and to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  our strategy is to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income by maintaining a favorable match between the maturities or repricing dates of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we adjust interest sensitivity during the year through changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset liability management committee  in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors of the bank 
this committee meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the asset liability committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee reviews our liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  deposit activity  current market conditions  and general levels of interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  we use simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various interest rate scenarios 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the following table presents an analysis of the interest rate sensitivity inherent in our net interest income and market value of equity 
the interest rate scenario presented in the table includes interest rates at december  as adjusted by instantaneous rate changes upward and downward of up to basis points 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  this analysis is not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates 
the market value sensitivity analysis presented includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at december  will remain constant over the month measurement period  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  the analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on us 
change in interest rates in basis points impact on net interest income market value of equity our results of operations depend significantly on net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the marketplace 
rising and falling interest rate environments can have various impacts on net interest income  depending on the interest rate profile ie  the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relative changes in interest rates that occur when various assets and liabilities reprice  unscheduled repayments of loans and leases and investments  early withdrawals of deposits  and other factors 
as a general rule  banks with positive interest rate gaps are more likely to be susceptible to declines in net interest income in periods of falling interest rates  while banks with negative interest rate gaps are more likely to experience declines in net interest income in periods of rising interest rates 
at december   our cumulative interest rate gap for less than one year was a positive 
therefore  assuming no change in our gap position  a rise in interest rates is likely to result in increased net interest income  while a decline in interest rates is likely to result in decreased net interest income 
this is a point in time position that is continually changing and is not indicative of our position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
consequently  in addition to gap analysis  we use the simulation model discussed above to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap  of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  all amounts in the table are based on contractual repricing schedules 
actual prepayment and withdrawal experience may vary significantly from the assumptions reflected in the table 
for information on the fair value of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
estimated maturity or repricing at december  in thousands less than three months three months to less than one year one to five years over five years total interest earning assets fixed rate loans floating rate loans lease financing investment securities held to maturity and available for sale total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities now and money market accounts savings time deposits under  time deposits  and over securities and loans sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased federal home loan bank advances junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities interest rate gap cumulative interest rate gap cumulative interest rate gap to total assets to manage these relationships  we evaluate the following factors liquidity  equity  debt capital ratio  anticipated prepayment rates  portfolio maturities  maturing assets and maturing liabilities 
our asset and liability management committee is responsible for establishing procedures that enable us to achieve our goals while adhering to prudent banking practices and existing loan and investment policies 
we have focused on maintaining balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and repricing frequencies 
an important element of this focus has been to emphasize variable rate loans and investments funded by deposits that also mature or reprice over periods of months or less 
the following table presents  at december   loans and leases by maturity in each major category of our portfolio 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications 
at december  in thousands less than one year one to five years over five years total commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer direct financing leases net total loans and leases at december   of the million of loans and leases with maturities of one year or more  approximately million were fixed rate loans and leases and million were variable rate loans and leases 
item b 
risk factors changes in economic conditions may cause us to incur loan and lease losses 
the inability of borrowers to repay loans and leases can erode our earnings and capital 
our loan and lease portfolio is somewhat less diversified than that of a traditional community bank because it includes a higher concentration of larger commercial loans 
substantially all of our loans and leases are to businesses and individuals in the denver and phoenix metropolitan areas  and any economic decline in these market areas could impact us adversely 
our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan and lease losses 
as a lender  we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans and leases according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans and leases may not be sufficient to assure repayment 
credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan and lease portfolio and provide an allowance for potential losses based on a number of factors 
if our assumptions are wrong  our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover our losses  thereby having an adverse effect on our operating results  and may cause us to increase the allowance in the future 
in addition  although our level of delinquencies historically has been low  we have been increasing and expect to continue to increase the number and amount of loans and leases we originate and we cannot assure you that we will not experience an increase in delinquencies and losses as these loans and leases continue to age  particularly if the favorable economic conditions in colorado and arizona reverse 
the actual amount of future provisions for loan and lease losses cannot now be determined and may exceed the amounts of past provisions 
additions to our allowance for loan and lease losses would decrease our net income 
our business is subject to various lending risks depending on the nature of the borrower s business  its cash flow and our collateral 
our commercial real estate loans involve higher principal amounts than other loans  and repayment of these loans may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers 
commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts  and the repayment of these loans generally is dependent  in large part  on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service 
rental income may not rise sufficiently over time to meet increases in the loan rate at repricing or increases in operating expenses  such as utilities and taxes 
as a result  impaired loans may be more difficult to identify without some seasoning 
because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties  repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower s control  such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation 
if the cash flow from the property is reduced  the borrower s ability to repay the loan and the value of the security for the loan may be impaired 
repayment of our commercial loans is often dependent on cash flow of the borrower  which may be unpredictable  and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value 
our commercial loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower 
most often  this collateral is accounts receivable  inventory  equipment or real estate 
in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable  the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers 
other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
our construction loans are based upon estimates of costs to construct and value associated with the completed project 
these estimates may be inaccurate 
because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs  as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property  it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio 
as a result  construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent  in part  on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property  rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest 
delays in completing the project may arise from labor problems  material shortages and other unpredictable contingencies 
if the estimate of construction costs is inaccurate  we may be required to advance additional funds to complete construction 
if our appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated  we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project 
our consumer loans generally have a higher risk of default than our other loans 
consumer loans entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans  particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets 
in such cases  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of damage  loss or depreciation 
the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus  are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans 
repayment of our direct financing leases is often dependent on cash flow of the borrower  which may be unpredictable  and collateral securing these leases may fluctuate in value 
leases are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower 
generally  leases finance of the cost of the equipment  which represents the underlying collateral 
the collateral securing equipment leases may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
we may experience difficulties in managing our growth 
as part of our strategy  we may expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current markets by undertaking additional de novo branch openings or new bank formations 
we believe that it may take up to eighteen months for new banking facilities to first achieve operational profitability  due to the impact of overhead expenses and the start up phase of generating loans and deposits 
to the extent that we undertake growth initiatives  we are likely to continue to experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations  which may have an adverse effect on our levels of reported net income  return on average equity and return on average assets 
in addition  we may acquire financial institutions and related businesses that we believe provide a strategic fit with our business 
to the extent that we grow through acquisitions  we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately and profitably manage such growth 
acquiring other financial institutions and businesses involves risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of financial institutions and other businesses we acquire  exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired banks or businesses  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of banks and businesses we acquire  potential disruption to our business  potential diversion of our management s time and attention  and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the banks and businesses we acquire 
we rely heavily on our management  and the loss of any of our senior officers may adversely affect our operations 
consistent with our policy of focusing growth initiatives on the recruitment of qualified personnel  we are highly dependent on the continued services of a small number of our executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the failure to recruit and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
changes in interest rates may affect our profitability 
our profitability is in part a function of the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
our net interest spread and margin will be affected by general economic conditions and other factors  including fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government  that influence market interest rates and our ability to respond to changes in such rates 
at any given time  our assets and liabilities will be such that they are affected differently by a change in interest rates 
as a result  an increase or decrease in rates  the length of loan terms or the mix of adjustable and fixed rate loans in our portfolio could have a positive or negative effect on our net income  capital and liquidity 
we have traditionally managed our assets and liabilities in such a way that we have a positive interest rate gap 
as a general rule  banks with positive interest rate gaps are more likely to be susceptible to declines in net interest income in periods of falling interest rates and are more likely to experience increases in net interest income in periods of rising interest rates 
our business and financial condition may be adversely affected by an increase in competition 
the banking business in the denver and phoenix metropolitan areas is highly competitive and is currently dominated by a number of large regional financial institutions 
in addition to these regional banks  there are a number of smaller commercial banks that operate in these areas 
we compete for loans and deposits with banks  savings and loan associations  finance companies  credit unions and mortgage bankers 
in addition to traditional financial institutions  we also compete for loans with brokerage and investment banking companies and governmental agencies that make available low cost or guaranteed loans to certain borrowers 
particularly in times of high interest rates  we also face significant competition for deposits from sellers of short term money market securities and other corporate and government securities 
by virtue of their larger capital bases or affiliation with larger multibank holding companies  many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources and lending limits than we have and perform other functions that we offer only through correspondents 
interstate banking and unlimited state wide branch banking are permitted in colorado and arizona 
as a result  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  greater competition in our primary service areas 
our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by an increase in competition 
moreover  recently enacted and proposed legislation has focused on expanding the ability of participants in the banking and thrift industries to engage in other lines of business 
the enactment of such legislation could put us at a competitive disadvantage because we may not have the capital to participate in other lines of business to the same extent as more highly capitalized financial service holding companies 
we continually encounter technological change  and we may have fewer resources than our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes  with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
we may be required to make capital contributions to the bank if it becomes undercapitalized 
under federal law  a bank holding company may be required to guarantee a capital plan filed by an undercapitalized bank subsidiary with its primary regulator 
if the subsidiary defaults under the plan  the holding company may be required to contribute to the capital of the subsidiary bank in an amount equal to the lesser of of the bank s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to bring the bank into compliance with applicable capital standards 
therefore  it is possible that we will be required to contribute capital to our subsidiary bank or any other bank that we may acquire in the event that such bank becomes undercapitalized 
if we are required to make such capital contribution at a time when we have other significant capital needs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
we are subject to significant government regulation  and any regulatory changes may adversely affect us 
the banking industry is heavily regulated under both federal and state law 
these regulations are primarily intended to protect customers  not our creditors or stockholders 
as a financial holding company  we are also subject to extensive regulation by the federal reserve board  in addition to other regulatory and self regulatory organizations 
regulations affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change  and we cannot predict the ultimate effect of such changes  which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or financial condition
