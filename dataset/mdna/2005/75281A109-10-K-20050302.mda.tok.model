item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capitalized terms herein are defined in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements contained herein 
the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition 
this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k 
statements in our discussion may be forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
we caution that a number of factors could cause future production  revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations 
see item of this report  risk factors  for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks 
overview we are an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  primarily in the southwestern  appalachian and gulf coast regions of the united states 
we operate in one segment as each of our operations areas has similar economics characteristics and each meets the criteria for aggregation as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we seek to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects coupled with complementary acquisitions 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
during  we achieved the following results reserve growth and production growth positive financial results favorable drilling results complementary acquisitions completed balance sheet simplified drilling inventory expanded  coalbed methane and shale plays added 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally adopted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related footnote disclosures 
application of certain of our accounting policies  including those related to oil and gas revenues  bad debts  the fair value of derivatives  oil and gas properties  asset retirement obligations  marketable securities  income taxes and contingencies and litigation require significant estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
property  plant and equipment proved reserves are defined by the sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although our engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price and cost changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in the depletion rates utilized by us 
we cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods 
reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our vice president of reservoir engineering who reports directly to our chief operating officer 
in addition  because substantially all of our proved reserves are pledged as collateral for our senior credit facility  our estimates of proved reserves are reviewed twice annually by independent engineers on behalf of each of the sixteen banks participating in our senior credit facility 
to further ensure the reliability of reserve estimates  we engage independent petroleum consultants to review the estimates of proved reserves 
the following table sets forth a summary of the reserves which were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended  and audited a a audited reserves are those quantities which were estimated by our employees and reviewed by an independent petroleum consultant 
we utilize the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on reported operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved oil and gas reserves as estimated by our engineers 
the successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves  which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes 
we adhere to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas for recognizing any impairment of capitalized costs to unproved properties 
the greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold costs 
the costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated as to recoverability  based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management 
we consider a combination of time  geologic and engineering factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs 
unproved properties had a net book value of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties 
as the estimated reserves are adjusted  the depletion expense for a property will change  assuming no change in production volumes or the costs capitalized 
estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property  which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired 
reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas producing activities and reserve quantities disclosure in note  unaudited supplemental reserve information to our consolidated financial statements 
changes in the estimated reserves are considered in estimates for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis 

table of contents we monitor our long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet to ensure they are fairly presented 
we must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of future production  future production costs  future abandonment costs  and future inflation 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or gas  unfavorable adjustment to reserves  physical damage to production equipment and facilities  a change in costs  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these factors must be considered when testing a property s carrying value for impairment 
we cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future 
we had an impairment of million in on an offshore property 
derivatives we use commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and gas price volatility 
we account for our commodity derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
earnings are affected by the ineffective portion of a hedge contract changes in realized prices that do not match the changes in the hedge price 
ineffective gains or losses are recorded in other revenue while the hedge contract is open and may increase or reverse until settlement of the contract 
this may result in significant volatility to current period income 
for derivatives qualifying as hedges  the effective portion of any changes in fair value is recognized in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income  or oci  and then reclassified to earnings  in oil and gas revenue  when the transaction is consummated 
this may result in significant volatility in stockholders equity 
the fair value of open hedging contracts is an estimated amount that could be realized upon termination 
the commodity derivatives we use include commodity collars and swaps 
while there is a risk that the financial benefit or rising prices may not be captured  we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important 
among these benefits are more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions  the flexibility to enter into long term projects requiring substantial committed capital  smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs  more consistent returns on invested capital  and better access to bank and other credit markets 
we also have some interest rate swap agreements to protect against the volatility of variable interest rates under our senior credit facility 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations 
removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as well as regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
asset retirement obligations are not unique to us or to the oil and gas industry and in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas 
we adopted this statement effective january   as discussed in note  asset retirement obligations  to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas significantly changed the method of accruing for costs that an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets asset retirement obligations or aro 
primarily  the statement requires us to record a separate liability for the fair value of our asset retirement obligations  with an offsetting increase to the related oil and gas properties on our consolidated balance sheet 
inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of retirement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
in addition  increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
sfas required a cumulative adjustment to reflect the impact of implementing the statement had the rule been in effect since inception 
we calculated the cumulative accretion expense on the aro liability and the cumulative depletion expense on the corresponding property balance 
the sum of this cumulative expense was compared to the depletion expense originally recorded 
because the historically recorded depletion expense was higher than the cumulative expense calculated under sfas  the difference resulted in a million gain  net of tax  which we recorded as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on january  
table of contents deferred taxes we are subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of a calendar year  b tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized 
we have deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryovers and other deductible differences 
we routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization 
a valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when we believe that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized 
in determining deferred tax liabilities  accounting rules require oci to be considered  even though such income loss has not yet been earned 
at year end  deferred tax assets exceeded deferred tax liabilities by million with million of deferred tax assets related to unrealized deferred hedging losses included in oci 
at year end  deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by million with million of deferred tax assets related to unrealized deferred hedging losses included in oci 
based on our projected profitability and because if prices remain constant  the unrealized hedging losses should be offset in the future by higher realization on our production  no year end valuation allowance was deemed necessary 
we may be challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions on our various income tax returns 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for all taxes  gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding tax matters 
contingent liabilities a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and contingent matters 
in addition  we often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts 
we monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for these matters based on available information 
although we continue to monitor all contingencies closely  particularly our outstanding litigation  we currently have no material accruals for contingent liabilities 
bad debt expense we periodically assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectability 
at independent producer finance  or ipf  receivables are evaluated quarterly and provisions for uncollectible amounts are established 
such provisions for uncollectible amounts are recorded when management believes that a related receivable is not recoverable based on current estimates of expected discounted cash flows and other factors which could affect the collection 
revenues we recognize revenues from the sale of products and services in the period delivered 
we use the sales method to account for gas imbalances  recognizing revenue based on cash received rather than gas produced 
revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products 
a substantial portion of production is sold at prevailing market prices  which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control 
changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have dramatic effects on prices 
political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply  while economic factors can impact demand 
at ipf  payments believed to relate to return are recognized as income 
currently  all ipf receipts are being recognized as a return of capital 
other we record a write down of marketable securities when the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary 
third party reimbursements for administrative overhead costs incurred due to our role as operator of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce general and administrative expense 
salaries and other employment costs of those employees working on our exploration efforts are expensed as exploration expense 
we do not capitalize general and administrative expense or interest expense 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the provisions of this statement become effective for our third quarter management has not determined the impact that this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a fasb staff position fsp that provides accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the american jobs creation act of that was signed into law on october  fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  states that the manufacturers deduction provided for under this legislation should be accounted for as a special deduction instead of a tax rate change 
the fsp may affect how a company accounts for deferred income taxes 
the fsp is effective december  we are currently evaluating the impact from the fsp on our results of operations and financial position and we expect to complete our evaluation during the first half of fiscal 
table of contents factors affecting financial condition and liquidity liquidity and capital resources during  we spent million on acquisitions  development and exploration 
acquisition expenditures were primarily comprised of million for the of great lakes we did not own and million for the pine mountain acquisition 
see footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had million in cash  including million of cash proceeds held in escrow to be used to purchase similar assets and billion of total assets 
total capitalization was billion  of which was represented by stockholder equity and by debt 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of million which included an unrealized hedging liability of million due to the mark to market of all open hedges 
because payments on this hedging liability are made monthly and we will also collect production proceeds to which this hedging relates  the amount should be self funding 
cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves which is typical in the capital intensive extractive industry 
future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves 
we believe that net cash generated from operating activities and unused committed borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility combined with our oil and gas price hedges currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near term financial obligations and liquidity needs 
however  long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business 
a material drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures  reduce debt  meet financial obligations and remain profitable 
we operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks  including  but not limited to  the inherent risks of the search for  development and production of oil and gas  the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry 
our ability to expand our reserve base is  in part  dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow  borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proved reserves 
in  we filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the sec registering million aggregate amount of common stock  preferred stock and other equity and debt securities 
in december  we issued million shares of common stock under this shelf registration statement for an aggregate price of million 
as of december   we have million of capacity remaining under the shelf 
the following summarizes our contractual financial obligations at december  and their future maturities 
we expect to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities and refinancing proceeds 
payment due by period and and thereafter total in thousands long term debt  a   interest on notes capital leases operating leases seismic purchase derivative obligations b asset retirement obligation liability total contractual obligations c a due at termination date of our senior credit facility  which we expect to renew  but there is no assurance that can be accomplished 
interest paid on the senior credit facility would be approximately million each year assuming no change in the interest rate or outstanding balance 
b derivative obligations represent net open hedging contracts valued as of december  c this table does not include the liability for the deferred compensation plan since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets 

table of contents bank credit facility we maintain a million revolving credit facility  which we refer to as our senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and matures on january  availability under the senior credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the banks semi annually and more often in certain other circumstances 
the borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors  primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows 
redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of of the lenders  increases require unanimous approval 
at february   the senior credit facility had a million borrowing base of which million was available 
restrictions on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments as defined are imposed under the our senior credit facility and the notes 
under the senior credit facility  common and preferred dividends are permitted 
the terms of the notes limit restricted payments including dividends to the greater of million or a formula based on earnings since the issuance of the notes 
at december   approximately million was available under the notes restricted basket 
the senior credit facility provides for a restricted payment basket of million plus of net cash proceeds from common stock issuances and of net income 
approximately million was available under the senior credit facility basket as of december  the debt agreements contain customary qualitative covenants relating to debt incurrence  working capital  dividends and a debt to earnings ratio 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  cash dividend payments in december  we announced the reinstatement of cash dividends on our common stock at an initial quarterly dividend rate of one cent per share 
the first dividend was paid on january  a one cent per share dividend was declared in the second and third quarters of on december   a two cent per share dividend was declared and paid on december  the payment of dividends is subject to declaration by our board of directors and depends on earnings  capital expenditures and various other factors  such as restrictions under our senior credit facility and the notes discussed above 
preferred dividends of    and  were paid in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of in addition  million of preferred dividend was accrued at december  related to the conversion of the convertible preferred stock 
cash flow our principal sources of cash are operating cash flow  bank borrowings and at times  issuance of debt and equity securities 
our operating cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices 
as of december   we had entered into hedging agreements covering bcfe and bcfe for and  respectively 
the million of cash capital expenditures for  excluding acquisitions  was funded with internal cash flow 
the million capital budget  which excludes acquisitions  is expected to increase production and to expand the reserve base 
based on current projections  oil and gas futures prices and our hedge position  the capital program is expected to be funded with internal cash flow 
net cash provided by operations in  and was million  million and million respectively 
in  cash flow from operations increased due to higher volumes and prices partially offset by increasing operating and exploration expenses 
in  cash flow from operations increased with higher volumes and higher prices partially offset by increasing operating and exploration expenses 
in  cash flow from operations decreased due to lower prices and volumes  higher exploration and higher general and administrative expenses 
this decrease was partially offset by lower interest expenses and direct operating expenses 
net cash used in investing activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the period included million in additions to oil and gas properties and million of acquisitions 
the period included million in additions to oil and gas properties  and million of acquisitions  partially offset by million of ipf receipts 
the period included million in additions to oil and gas properties and million of ipf investments partially offset by million of ipf receipts 
net cash provided by used in financing activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
historically  sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and 
table of contents debt offerings 
during  we received proceeds of million and million from the issuance of additional notes and two common stock offerings  respectively 
during  the outstanding balance under our senior credit facility increased million with million related to the great lakes transaction and the remaining increase the result of funding other acquisitions 
also in  we redeemed the remaining outstanding debentures for million 
during  the outstanding balance under our senior credit facility increased million primarily due to the december acquisition of producing properties in the conger field 
in  total debt declined million 
during  we redeemed million of the trust preferred securities and million of the notes and issued million of notes 
during  the outstanding balance under our senior credit facility increased million and total debt including trust preferred securities decreased by million 
capital requirements our primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends 
during  million of capital was expended  primarily on drilling projects 
also during  million was expended on acquisitions  including million to purchase producing properties and million to purchase gathering facilities 
the capital program  excluding acquisitions  was funded by net cash flow from operations 
the capital budget of million  excluding acquisitions  is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations 
development and exploration activities are highly discretionary  and  for the foreseeable future  we expect such activities to be maintained at levels equal to or below internal cash flow 
to the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow  debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements 
we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet our obligations for the next twelve months  however  a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves could adversely affect our ability to fund capital expenditures and meet our financial obligations 
also  our obligations may change due to acquisitions  divestitures and continued growth 
we may issue additional shares of stock  subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  extend maturities or to repay debt 
hedging oil and gas prices we enter into hedging agreements to reduce the impact of oil and gas price volatility on our operations 
at december   hedges were in place covering bcf of gas at prices averaging per mcf  million barrels of oil at prices averaging per barrel and million barrels of ngls at prices averaging per barrel 
we also had collars covering bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of to and million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of to 
the hedges fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination  based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price  generally nymex  approximated a pretax loss of million at december  the contracts expire monthly through december transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases on oil and gas revenue in the period the hedged production is sold 
a hedging gain of million was realized in hedging losses of million and million were realized in and  respectively 
changes in the value of the ineffective portion of all open hedges are recognized in earnings quarterly in other income 
since  unrealized gains or losses on hedging positions are recorded at an estimate of fair value based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price  generally nymex  on our consolidated balance sheet as oci  a component of stockholders equity 
at december   the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding contract type period volume hedged average hedge price natural gas swaps  mmbtu day swaps  mmbtu day collars  mmbtu day collars  mmbtu day crude oil swaps  bbl day swaps bbl day collars  bbl day collars  bbl day natural gas liquids swaps bbl day 
table of contents interest rates at december   we had million of debt outstanding 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate of 
senior debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  which average at year end  excluding interest rate swaps 
at december   we had million subject to fixed for floating interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps consist of one agreement for million at which expires in june and two agreements totaling million at which expire in june the day libor rate on december  was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would cost us approximately million in additional annual interest  net of swaps 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to our financial position or results of operations 
inflation and changes in prices our revenues  the value of our assets  our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict 
although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation  inflation does not normally have a significant effect on us 
however  industry specific inflationary pressures built up over an month period in and early due to favorable conditions in the industry 
during  we experienced a slight decline in certain drilling and operational costs when compared to the prior year and in there were slight increases in these costs 
in  we experienced an overall increase in drilling costs compared to especially with regard to steel products 
we expect further increases in these costs for increases in commodity prices can cause inflationary pressures specific to the industry to also increase 

table of contents the following table indicates the average oil and gas prices received over the last five years and quarterly for  and average price calculations exclude hedging gains and losses 
oil is converted to natural gas equivalents at the rate of one barrel per six mcf 
average prices excluding hedging equivalent oil natural gas mcf per bbl per mcf per mcfe annual quarterly first second third fourth first second third fourth first second third fourth industry environment we operate entirely within the united states  a mature region for the exploration and production of oil and gas 
as a mature region  while new discoveries of oil and gas occur in the united states  the size and frequency of these discoveries is declining 
we believe that there remain areas of the united states  such as the appalachian basin and certain areas in our southwestern division  that are underexplored and have not been fully explored with the benefit of newly available exploration  production and reserve enhancement technology 
examples of such technology include advanced d seismic processing  hydraulic reservoir fracture stimulation  advances in well logging and analysis  horizontal drilling and completion techniques  secondary and tertiary recovery practices  and automated remote well monitoring and control devices 
another characteristic of a mature region is the exit of larger independent producers and the major oil companies from such regions 
these companies  searching for ever larger new discoveries  have ventured increasingly overseas and offshore  de emphasizing their onshore united states assets 
this movement out of mature basins by larger companies has provided attractive acquisition opportunities for companies like ours that maintain well equipped technical teams capable of generating additional value from these assets 
in other situations  to increase cash flow without increasing capital spending  larger independent producers and major integrated oil companies have allowed smaller companies the opportunity to explore and develop reserves on their undeveloped acreage through joint ventures 
we acquired approximately  acres in for our southwestern division from such arrangements

overview our performance reflects the benefit of higher oil and gas production  higher oil and gas prices  and continued focus upon our cost structure 
the business of exploring for  developing  and acquiring oil and gas is highly competitive and capital intensive 
as in any commodity business  the costs associated with finding  acquiring  extracting  and financing the operation are critical to profitability and long term value creation for stockholders and generating meaningful growth while containing costs represents an ongoing challenge for management 
during periods of historically high oil and gas prices  such as  cost increases are more prevalent due to increased competition for goods and services 
we faced other challenges in include attracting and retaining qualified personnel  consummating and integrating acquisitions  and accessing the capital markets to fund our growth and capital simplification process on sufficiently favorable terms 
we have continued to expand and improve the technical staff through the hiring of additional experienced professionals 
also  acquisitions completed in late and have added experienced professionals to our teams 
the inventory of exploration and development prospects continues to expand  providing promising new growth opportunities  greater diversification of technical risk  and better efficiency 
our balance sheet was further simplified in with the retirement of the convertible subordinated notes and the elimination of the great lakes bank credit facility 
lastly  the convertible preferred stock was converted to common stock in december of our capital structure now consists of bank debt  senior subordinated notes and common equity 

table of contents comparison of to net income increased million  with higher average oil and gas prices and volumes as a primary factor contributing to this increase

productive well 
a well that is producing oil or gas or that is capable of production 
proved developed non producing reserves 
reserves that consist of i proved reserves from wells which have been completed and tested but are not producing due to lack of market or minor completion problems which are expected to be corrected and ii proved reserves currently behind the pipe in existing wells and which are expected to be productive due to both the well log characteristics and analogous production in the immediate vicinity of the wells 
proved developed reserves 
proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods

table of contents item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposure 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
all accounts are us dollar denominated 
commodity price risk our major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices 
realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for north american gas production 
oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years 
we periodically enter into hedging arrangements with respect to our oil and gas production 
hedging is intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations 
certain of our hedges are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty 
in the second quarter of  the hedging program was modified to include collars which assume a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price 
realized gains and losses are generally recognized in oil and gas revenues when the associated production occurs 
starting in  gains or losses on open contracts are recorded either in current period income or other comprehensive income oci 
generally  derivative losses occur when market prices increase  which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction 
conversely  derivative gains occur when market prices decrease  which are offset by losses on the underlying commodity transaction 
ineffective gains and losses are recognized in earnings in other revenue 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as of december   we had oil and gas swaps in place covering billion cubic feet of gas  million barrels of oil and million barrels of ngls 
we also had collars covering bcf of gas and million barrels of oil 
these contracts expire monthly through december the fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of december   approximated a net pre tax loss of million 
gains or losses realized on hedging transactions are determined monthly based upon the difference between contract price received by us for the sale of our hedged production and the hedge price  generally closing prices on the nymex 
these gains and losses are included as increases or decreases to oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold 
in  there was a net pre tax realized gain associated with the hedges of million followed by a loss of million in in pre tax loss realized of million was recorded relating to our hedges 
losses due to commodity hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings in other revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
the ineffective portion of hedges recorded was a loss of million in and million in and a gain of  in at december   the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding contract type period volume hedged average hedge price natural gas swaps  mmbtu day swaps  mmbtu day collars  mmbtu day collars  mmbtu day crude oil swaps  bbl day swaps bbl day collars  bbl day collars  bbl day natural gas liquids swaps bbl day 
table of contents in  a reduction in oil and gas prices  excluding amounts fixed through hedging transactions  would have reduced revenue by million 
if oil and gas futures prices at december  had declined by  the unrealized hedging loss at that date would have decreased million 
interest rate risk at december   we had million of debt outstanding 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate of 
senior debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  excluding interest rate swaps  which averaged on that date 
at december   we had floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements totaling million 
these swaps consist of one agreement for million at which expires in june and two agreements totaling million at which expire in june on december   the day libor rate was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding net of amounts fixed through hedging transactions at december  would cost us approximately million in additional annual interest rates  net of swaps
