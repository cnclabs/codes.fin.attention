item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders 
we believe that our advanced understanding of the biology of cardiovascular disease combined with our clinical development expertise in cardiovascular therapeutics provide us with the capability to discover novel therapies  as well as identify  license or acquire products that address serious  debilitating cardiovascular disorders that are not adequately treated with existing therapies 
we have three product candidates in late stage clinical development enoximone capsules for the treatment of patients with advanced chronic heart failure  ambrisentan for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension pah and darusentan for the treatment of patients with resistant systolic hypertension 
all three of our product candidates are orally administered small molecules that we believe offer advantages over currently available therapies and have the potential to address unmet needs in their respective markets 

table of contents enoximone 
we currently market an intravenous iv formulation of enoximone  perfan iv  in eight countries in europe for the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure 
we believe that chronic oral administration of low doses of enoximone capsules has the potential to alleviate symptoms and reduce hospitalizations for patients with advanced chronic heart failure  resulting in a decrease in associated health care costs and improvement in patients quality of life 
we are evaluating enoximone capsules in three phase iii trials essential i ii and empower and we completed one additional phase iii trial in february emote 
in november  we announced the completion of the treatment phase of both essential trials 
we plan to report preliminary data for the essential trials in the middle of ambrisentan 
we believe that ambrisentan may have several clinical benefits over existing pah therapies  including greater and more durable efficacy  low incidence of liver toxicity  once daily dosing and lower incidence of interactions with other drugs 
we completed a phase ii clinical trial of ambrisentan in september and announced the initiation of the two pivotal phase iii trials  aries  in january we expect to complete enrollment in aries by the end of june and aries in the fourth quarter of we plan to report preliminary results from each of the aries trials approximately six months following the completion of enrollment in each trial 
darusentan 
we believe that there is a significant need for a therapeutic agent that  when added to currently available medications  is capable of lowering blood pressure in patients suffering from resistant systolic hypertension ie  patients whose blood pressure cannot be adequately controlled with existing medication 
we believe that darusentan may be an agent that is capable of improving control of blood pressure in this patient population  leading to the potential for enhanced patient outcomes  such as a reduction in the number of serious cardiac events and the progression of chronic kidney disease 
in july  we announced the initiation of a phase iib clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of darusentan in patients with resistant systolic hypertension 
we expect this trial to be completed in the middle of and we intend to report results of the trial shortly thereafter 
through our internal research program and academic collaborations  we are developing an advanced understanding of the biological pathways of heart disease and have discovered several novel molecular targets that we believe play a key role in heart failure 
we are in the development stage and since inception have devoted substantially all of our efforts to the discovery  in licensing and development of drugs to treat cardiovascular disease 
we have incurred losses each year since our inception and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we incurred operating losses of million  million  million for the years  and  respectively 
our research and development expenses have historically been much higher than our revenues 
our current revenue is derived from sales of perfan iv in eight european countries and research and development contract revenues from our agreement with novartis signed in october prior to our licensing the worldwide rights to enoximone in  perfan iv was marketed in europe by aventis 
in  we formed our wholly owned german subsidiary  myogen gmbh  to manage our sales and marketing activities in europe 
from through  we entered into agreements with distributors to distribute perfan iv in belgium  france  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands and the united kingdom 
we recorded our first sales of perfan iv in even if our sales and marketing efforts lead to modest increases in perfan iv sales in future periods  we do not expect that such increases will result in a material reduction in our overall net loss 
our cost of product sold reflects the cost of perfan iv  which we purchase exclusively from contract manufacturers  and the cost of royalties payable to aventis 
our primary business activities have been focused on the development of enoximone capsules  ambrisentan and darusentan 
from inception to december   we have incurred expenses of approximately million  million and million for the development of enoximone capsules  
table of contents ambrisentan and darusentan  respectively 
these expenses represent both clinical development costs and the costs associated with non clinical support activities such as toxicological testing  manufacturing process development and regulatory consulting services 
we also report the costs of product licenses in this category  including our milestone obligations associated with the licensing of enoximone  ambrisentan and darusentan 
while some of our research and development expenses are the result of the internal costs related directly to our employees  a majority of the expenses are charged to us by external service providers  including clinical research organizations and contract manufacturers 
the cost of our clinical trial programs is the most significant portion of our development expenses  with the number of patients enrolled in a trial and the attendant level of contract research organization and clinical site activity being the principal cost determinants 
we expect that expenses in the research and development category will increase for the foreseeable future as we add personnel and expand our clinical trial activities 
the amount of the increase is difficult to predict due to the uncertainty inherent in the timing of clinical trial initiations  the rate of patient enrollment and the detailed design of future trials 
in addition  the results from our trials  as well as the results of trials of similar drugs under development by others  will influence the number  size and duration of planned and unplanned trials 
we have a discovery research effort  which is conducted by our scientists  through collaborative agreements with academic laboratories and in conjunction with novartis 
in october  we entered into a research collaboration with the novartis institutes for biomedical research  inc novartis for the discovery and development of novel drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
in exchange for license payments and a commitment to fund our research  novartis has the exclusive right to license drug targets and compounds developed through the collaboration 
upon execution of a license  novartis is obligated to fund all further development of the licensed product candidate  make payments to us upon the achievement of certain milestones and pay us royalties for sales of any products that are successfully commercialized 
upon the completion of phase ii clinical trials of any product candidate novartis has licensed from us  we have the option to enter into a co promotion and profit sharing agreement with them for that product candidate  subject to our reimbursement of a portion of the development expenses up to that point  our agreement to share the future development and marketing expenses and elimination of the royalty payable to us 
our selling  general and administrative expense category consists of our sales  marketing  business development  finance  accounting and general administration costs 
these costs are primarily comprised of expenses related directly to our staff  as well as external costs associated with service providers such as lawyers  accountants and insurers 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase significantly in the foreseeable future based on our expectation that we will expand our efforts to prepare for the potential commercialization of enoximone capsules and ambrisentan 
our on going clinical programs studying enoximone capsules  ambrisentan and darusentan will be lengthy and expensive 
even if these trials show our product candidates to be safe and effective in treating their target conditions  we do not expect to be able to record commercial sales of any of our product candidates for several years 
as a result  we expect to incur significant and growing losses for the foreseeable future 
although the size and timing of our future operating losses is subject to significant uncertainty  we expect them to continue to increase over the next several years as we continue to fund our development programs and prepare for potential commercial launch of our product candidates 
our primary source of working capital has been equity financings 
the pace and outcome of our clinical development programs and the progress of our discovery research program are difficult to predict 
if we enter into additional third party collaborations or acquire new product candidates  the timing or amounts of any related licensing payments or expenses are likely to be highly variable 
as a result  we anticipate that our quarterly results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
in view of this variability and of our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicative of our future performance

 of the increase in as compared to was due to a favorable change in the euro exchange rate  and the remainder was due to an increase in sales volume  partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price 
we expect that perfan iv unit sales in will be similar to sales  and we do not expect sales of this product to become significant compared to our level of expenses 
research and development contracts revenue research and development contracts revenues for the years ended december  and were related to the research agreement with novartis executed in october  therefore  there was no corresponding revenue in the research and development contract revenue consists of license revenue totaling million and research support funding of million 
the research and development contract revenue consists of license revenue totaling  and research support funding of  the license revenue is related to the non refundable upfront payment from novartis  which is recognized ratably over the expected service period 
the research support funding is related to the fully burdened cost of the researchers working on the further development of specific potential drug targets and is recognized in the period in which the services are performed 
we expect both license revenue and research support in to approximate the amounts recognized in costs and expenses years ended december  in thousands costs and expenses cost of product sold research and development excluding stock based compensation selling  general and administrative excluding stock based compensation expense stock based compensation 
table of contents cost of product sold the cost of product sold for perfan iv increased in as compared to due to an increase in units sold 
the cost of product sold for perfan iv increased slightly in as compared to due to currency fluctuations partially offset by a reduction in material costs associated with a change in contract manufacturing 
due to these factors  the cost of perfan iv sold as a percentage of product sales were   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development research and development expenses  excluding stock based compensation expenses are summarized as follows years ended december  in thousands development enoximone capsules ambrisentan darusentan total development license fees enoximone ambrisentan darusentan other total license fees discovery research total research and development the million increase in development costs for enoximone capsules in as compared to was primarily due to the following million increase in clinical investigator site payments and external contract costs associated with clinical monitoring and program management efforts as a result of higher patient enrollment and ongoing patient progress in the essential trials   increase in external contract costs associated with clinical monitoring  clinical trial materials  consulting and program management efforts related to other enoximone trials   increase related to enoximone raw material costs expensed for expected use in manufacturing development and analytical testing   increase in costs associated with stability and release testing  and million increase in the internal costs associated with the management of the enoximone trials primarily due to an increase in the number of employees 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease related to manufacturing process optimization and development 

table of contents the million increase in development costs for enoximone capsules in as compared to was primarily due to the following million increase in clinical investigator site payments and external contract costs associated with clinical monitoring and program management efforts  as a result of higher patient enrollment and ongoing patient progress in the essential trials   increase in the costs associated with work on developing the commercial manufacturing process for enoximone   increase in the internal costs associated with the management of the enoximone trials  primarily due to an increase in our staff  and  increase in costs associated with producing clinical trial materials for the essential trial 
these increases are partially offset by a  decrease in costs associated with the continuing emote trial  reflecting reduced costs  as this study nears completion 
we anticipate that our enoximone capsules clinical trial costs will be reduced due to the completion of a substantial part of our enoximone clinical program  but substantial additional costs will be incurred in connection with our product development  manufacturing and regulatory efforts 
the million increase in development costs for ambrisentan in as compared to was primarily related to million increase in expenses due to the cost of our two phase iii aries trials and the related extension study  which were initiated in january  million increase in expenses related to work on developing the commercial manufacturing process for ambrisentan   increase in expenses due to the extension study associated with our phase ii pah trial  and  increase in internal expenses associated with the management of the ambrisentan trials  primarily due to an increase in the number of employees 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease related to the conclusion of our phase ii pah trial in september the million increase in development costs for ambrisentan in as compared to was primarily related to million increase in expenses related to non clinical toxicology studies  million increase in expenses due to the cost of activities preparatory to initiating our two phase iii aries trials   increase in expenses due to the initiation of the extension study for our phase ii pah trial  and  increase in internal expenses associated with the management of the ambrisentan trials 
these increases are partially offset by a  decrease due to costs which were incurred in related to the exploration of a potential additional indication of ambrisentan that we did not pursue 
we anticipate development costs associated with ambrisentan to increase in compared to due to the expansion of our efforts dedicated to the aries trials and increased costs related to process development and manufacturing 

table of contents the development costs for darusentan in the were related to costs for the phase iib clinical trial million in expenses incurred from activities related to our phase iib clinical trial of darusentan in resistant systolic hypertension   in consulting costs   in expenses related to analytical and regulatory work  and  in internal expenses associated with the management of the darusentan trials primarily due to an increase in the number of employees 
we believe our costs for the development of darusentan will increase in compared to due to the costs to complete the phase iib clinical trial and costs to prepare for pivotal phase iii trials  if the phase iib results are encouraging 
in  the license fees were primarily attributable to the initiation of the ambrisentan phase iii trials totaling million 
in  the million license fee was attributable to the in licensing of darusentan and the final million cost reimbursement for ambrisentan 
the license fees were for the final upfront fee for enoximone of million and a million payment for prior research costs incurred by the prior sponsor of ambrisentan 
discovery research expenses increased primarily due to increased staffing costs related to our collaborative research program with novartis in as compared to the initiation of the novartis collaboration occurred in october of in addition  we had a decrease of  in sbir funding  which reduced the amount of the offset to our research costs 
we expect a further increase in discovery research in due to a planned expansion of our research staff  much of which will not lead to increased research contracts revenue 
although total discovery research expenses were relatively consistent from to  in we recorded an increase in internal spending of  to expand our high throughput screening efforts 
this was offset by a decrease of  in our support of research programs at academic laboratories and a decrease of  in reported costs due to increased sbir funding  which is treated as an offset to expense 
selling  general and administrative the million increase in selling  general and administrative expense in as compare to primarily relates to million increase in insurance and professional service costs related to being a public company for the full year  including costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  million related to increased staffing and related recruiting costs   increase in market research costs   increase related to facility and office maintenance costs related to increased space and staffing  and  increase in conferences and consulting costs 
the  decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in as compared to primarily relates to a decrease of  in consulting costs and a  decrease in relocation and travel costs offset by a  increase in insurance costs related to becoming a public company 
we expect a significant increase in selling  general and administrative expense in  based on our expectation that we will expand our efforts to prepare for the potential commercialization of enoximone capsules and ambrisentan 

table of contents stock based compensation stock based compensation expenses were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively

accretion of the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock for the years ended december  and represented the accretion associated with the series a  series c and series d mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock 
the million decrease in is due to the conversion of all mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock upon completion of our initial public offering in november  offset by an increase associated with the issuance of an additional million of series d mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock in august there is no corresponding expense in due to the conversion of all shares of the series a  c and d mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock on november  deemed dividend on august   we issued  shares of series d preferred stock at a price of per share and received net proceeds of million

our cash outflows in the next months are expected to consist primarily of external expenses related to our research and development programs  as well as payroll costs 
our cash outflows beyond one year are also expected to consist primarily of external expenses related to our research and development programs  including payroll costs 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances will allow us to fund our future working capital and capital expenditures through at least the end of the first quarter of and potentially longer if the results of our essential trials and or phase iib trial of darusentan are not positive

the loan accrues interest at per annum 
the first three monthly repayments were comprised of interest only  the remaining thirty three payments are comprised of both principal and interest 
concurrent with this loan agreement  warrants were granted to the financial institutions 
substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for the loan 
we expect to pay off our obligations under the loan by january we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the end of the first quarter of however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
although we expect that our existing resources could be adequate to support our operations for a longer period of time under certain scenarios  there can be no assurance that this can  in fact  be accomplished 
we plan to raise additional financing to meet future working capital and capital expenditure needs 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or  if available  that such financing can be obtained on terms satisfactory to us

in addition  many of our contracts with clinical 
table of contents research organizations  contract manufacturers  academic research agreements and others contain termination provisions that would require us to make final payments if we were to terminate prematurely 
the size of these payments depends upon the timing and circumstances of the termination and therefore the extent of the future commitments cannot be meaningfully quantified 
net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at december   we had million of net operating loss carryforwards  approximately million in research and development credits and approximately million in orphan drug credit carryforwards available to offset future regular and alternative taxable income 
these net operating loss carryforwards  research and development and orphan drug credit carryforwards expire beginning in  and  respectively 
the internal revenue code places certain limitations on the annual amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized if certain changes in our ownership occur 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and informed management judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain revenue recognition  accounting for research and development expenses  estimating the value of our equity instruments for use in deferred stock based compensation calculations  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
arrangements with multiple elements are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf we consider this methodology to be the most appropriate for our business model and current revenue streams 
product sales 
sales are recognized when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii product is shipped from the distributor s consignment stock to the customer  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is reasonably assured 
once the product is shipped to the customer  we do not allow product returns 
research and development contracts 
we may enter into collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical companies where the other party generally receives exclusive marketing and distribution rights for certain products for set time periods and set geographic areas 
the rights associated with this research and development are assigned or can be assigned to the collaborator or through a license at the collaborator s option 
the terms of the collaborative agreements can include non refundable licensing fees  funding of research and development efforts  payments based on achievement of certain milestones  and royalties on product sales 
we analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting in accordance 
table of contents with eitf we recognize up front license payments as revenue if the license has standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered items can be determined 
if the license is considered to have standalone value but the fair value on any of the undelivered items cannot be determined  the license payments are recognized as revenue over the period of performance for such undelivered items or services 
non refundable license fees received are recorded as deferred revenue once received or irrevocably committed  and are recognized ratably over the longer of the development period to which they relate or the expected duration of the contractual relationship 
where there are two or more distinct phases embedded into one contract such as product development and subsequent commercialization or manufacturing  the contracts may be considered multiple element arrangements 
when it can be demonstrated that each of these phases is at fair value  they are treated as separate earnings processes with upfront fees being recognized over only the initial product development phase 
the relevant time period for the product development phase is based on management estimates and could vary depending upon the outcome of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process 
as a result  management frequently reviews the appropriate time period 
milestone payments  based on designated achievement points that are considered at risk and substantive at the inception of the collaborative contract  are recognized as earned when the earnings process is complete and the corresponding payment is reasonably assured 
we evaluate whether milestone payments are at risk and substantive based on the contingent nature of the milestone  specifically reviewing factors such as the technological and commercial risk that needs to be overcome and the level of investment required 
milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
revenue from research funding is recognized when the services are performed and is typically based on the fully burdened cost of a researcher working on a collaboration 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period as services are performed  with the balance reflected as deferred revenue until earned 
accounting for research and development expenses 
our research and development expense category is primarily composed of costs associated with product development for enoximone capsules  ambrisentan and darusentan 
these expenses represent both clinical development costs and the costs associated with non clinical support activities such as toxicological testing  manufacturing process development and regulatory consulting services 
clinical development costs represent internal costs for personnel  external costs incurred at clinical sites and contractual payments to third party clinical research organizations to perform certain clinical trials 
we also report the costs of product licenses in this category  including our ongoing milestone obligations associated with the licensing of ambrisentan and darusentan 
our product candidates do not currently have regulatory approval  accordingly  we expense the license and milestone fees when we incur the liability 
we have a discovery research effort  which is conducted in part on our premises by our scientists and in part through collaborative agreements 
while some of our research and development expenses are the result of the internal costs related directly to our employees  a majority of the expenses are charged to us by external service providers  including clinical research organizations and contract manufacturers  and by our academic collaborators 
we record research and development expenses for activity occurring during the fiscal period related to the service delivery and in some cases accruing the cost prior to receiving invoices from clinical sites and third party clinical research organizations 
we accrue external costs for clinical studies based on the progress of the clinical trials  including patient enrollment  progress by the enrolled patients through the trial  and contractual costs with clinical research organizations and clinical sites 
we record internal costs primarily related to personnel in clinical development and external costs related to non clinical studies and basic 
table of contents research when incurred 
amounts received from other parties to fund our research and development efforts where the reimbursing party does not obtain any rights to the research or drug candidates are recognized as a reduction to research and development expense as the costs are incurred 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual costs incurred may or may not match the estimated costs for a given accounting period 
valuation of equity instruments 
we record compensation expense related to options issued to consultants and options issued to  or common stock sold to  employees at less than the fair value 
as a result  we have recorded deferred stock based compensation expense that represents  in the case of employees  the difference between the option exercise price and the fair value of our common stock 
in the case of consultants  deferred stock based compensation represents the fair value of the options granted  computed using the black scholes option pricing model 
these expenses are based on the fair value of the options and common stock 
because prior to our initial public offering  there was no public market for our common stock  we have estimated the fair value of these equity instruments using various valuation methods 
subsequent to our initial public offering on october   we estimate the fair value of these equity instruments using the value for our common stock that the public market establishes 
deferred stock based compensation for employees is recognized over the remaining vesting period of the related option 
deferred stock based compensation related to consultants is recognized over the vesting period of the related option and the amount recognized is subject to change based on changes in the fair value of our common stock 
we recognize stock based compensation using an accelerated method as described in financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and fin 
accounting for income taxes 
we must make significant management judgments when determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we recorded a full valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax asset balance  due to uncertainties related to the ultimate recovery of our deferred tax assets as a result of our history of operating losses 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in january of  fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
in december  the fasb issued fin r  which clarified certain issues identified in fin fin r requires an entity to consolidate a variable interest entity if the entity is designated as the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity even if the entity does not have a majority of voting interest 
a variable interest entity is generally defined as an entity where its equity is unable to finance its activities or where the owners of the entity lack the risk and rewards of ownership 
the provisions of this statement apply at inception of any entity created after january  for an entity created before february   the provisions of this interpretation must be applied at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after march  we do not have any variable interest entities  therefore the implementation of fin did not have an impact on our operating results  financial position  or cash flows 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the fasb ratified this consensus in november eitf issue no 
requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures for marketable debt and equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
in september  the final release of fsp eitf  effective date of paragraphs of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
table of contents fsp was approved 
fsp delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance included in paragraphs through of eitf  however  disclosures required by eitf  paragraphs and  have not been deferred 
the disclosures required by fsp are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had no material unrealized losses on our marketable debt securities 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on issue  participating securities and the two class method under financial accounting standards board fasb statement  issue requires the two class method of calculating earnings per share for companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends of the company 
this change in computational methods had no impact on earnings per share for any period in fiscal or any prior period 
in september  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
eitf requires that all issued securities that have embedded conversion features that are contingently exercisable upon the occurrence of a market price condition be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
eitf is effective in the periods ending after december  and would be applied by retrospectively restating previously reported diluted earnings per share 
the adoption of eitf did not impact our earnings per share 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material  and requires that such items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the so abnormal criterion outlined in arb no 
sfas no 
also introduces the concept of normal capacity and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overheads must be recognized as an expense in the period incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
on december   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than july  we expect to adopt sfas no 
r in the third quarter of sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we are still assessing the appropriate transition method 

table of contents as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using the apb no 
intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position or cash flows 
statement no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  there were no operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions for stock option exercises 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r and have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures on market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
our financial instruments consist of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts receivable  accounts payable and long term obligations 
we consider investments that  when purchased  have a remaining maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
we invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
the maximum allowable duration of a single issue is months and the average duration of the issues in the portfolio is less than nine months 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of short term investments in a variety of interest bearing instruments  consisting of united states government and agency securities  high grade united states corporate bonds  municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities and money market accounts of million excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents 
our short term investments consist primarily of bank notes  various government obligations and asset backed securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of stockholders equity 
unrealized losses are charged against income when a decline in fair market value is determined to be other than temporary 
the specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
in general  securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities 
due in part to this factor  our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  we believe an immediate change in interest rates would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents the table below summarizes the book value  fair value  unrealized gains losses and related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio as of december  and unrealized unrealized average rate amortized aggregate holding holding of return security type cost basis fair value gains losses annualized december  government securities corporate debt securities asset backed securities total investments december  government securities corporate debt securities commercial paper asset backed securities total investments the euro is the functional currency for myogen gmbh 
we translate asset and liability accounts to the united states dollar based on the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date  while the income statement and cash flow statement amounts are translated to the united states dollar at the average exchange rate for the period 
exchange gains and losses resulting from such translation are included as a separate component of stockholders equity deficit 
transaction gains and losses are recognized in income during the period in which they occur and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  we conduct clinical trials in many countries  exposing us to cost increases if the united states dollar declines in value compared to other currencies
