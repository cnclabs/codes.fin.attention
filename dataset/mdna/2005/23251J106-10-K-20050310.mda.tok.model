market characteristics in  forrester research estimated the total us online consumer market to be billion 
their total estimate of us business to consumer online sales for is billion  a six year compounded annual growth rate of 
forrester estimates us ecommerce revenues for will be billion 
online sales in europe are growing at an even faster pace 
forrester estimates that ecommerce revenues in europe were billion in and will be billion in  both in us dollars 
though ecommerce sales represent only of sales by us retailers  ecommerce sales are growing by per year  far faster than the growth rate of traditional in store credit card purchases 
as the online commerce market has grown  business requirements and attitudes about electronic commerce have evolved 
what began as an online sales experiment for many organizations has become a strategic component of their business plan 
although credit cards have long been the dominant payment method available to online purchasers  alternative consumer preferences and cultural preferences have impacted the global payment environment 
a wide spectrum of payment options  such as debit cards  electronic checks  stored value certificates  and online payment innovations such as paypal are emerging worldwide 
since  we have experienced a noticeable trend among some of our large us customers that seek greater access to international markets  especially europe 
conducting online commerce internationally involves supporting more payment types  currency conversions  new payment processors and mitigating higher fraud risk 
the growth of ecommerce has also resulted in more complexity with internal business processes 
online fraud has evolved into an organized and systemic threat to online merchants 
the latest cybersource fraud survey  sponsored by cybersource and conducted by mindwave research in october  concluded that online sellers expected fraudulent transactions to cost them of revenues  on average  in though that is statistically equivalent to the direct fraud cost projected by the prior year s survey  the data suggests that the overall cost of fraud  which includes the cost of fraud management and the rejection of good orders  continues to rise 
the cost of fraud management is incurred  for example  when merchants require manual intervention  a step that slows order processing and increases costs 
among other things  we are focused on improving our automated management tools to speed the appropriate disposition of orders 
online merchants are also giving increased focus to meeting regulatory requirements in areas such as collection of sales taxes 
us merchants are gradually moving toward adding sales tax to their online orders as state and local governments focus 
table of contents on this revenue source 
european union regulations adopted in july require that all online sellers of digital goods collect the applicable value added tax for sales in the european union 
the combination of these market trends is making the management of electronic payment transactions more complex 
online merchants are finding the need to maintain technical and financial connections with a number of different payment processors and service providers  integrate those disparate connections with a number of internal business systems  allocate manual resources to keep up with the pace of online sales  and comply with statutory requirements 
cybersource focuses on enabling our customers to meet these market requirements simply and cost effectively 
our goal is to provide a single source solution that simplifies and optimizes online payment 
platform options cybersource solutions are made available to customers through hosted services  enterprise software  or a combination of the two

this system is composed of multiple groups of servers and routers that appear as a single point of contact to our customers systems 
this system also utilizes the latest industry standards to maximize compatibility with our customers commerce systems 
in addition  we have implemented a global network of telecommunications access points that are designed to optimize transaction processing response times and to mitigate the effects of system failures 
the primary software components of our system are the transaction databases  the commerce processing engine  the commerce services applications  the cybersource order processing api  the simple commerce messaging protocol scmp and respective client software 
transaction database architecture two primary databases form the core of our transaction processing system the transaction processing database  which maintains information necessary to process each individual transaction  and the post transaction database  which generates and provides detailed information about customers transactions  with advanced reporting capabilities available in xml and other formats 
commerce engine our commerce engine manages workflow functions and the required communications between our servers  our database  and our processors  including barclays bank  first data corporation  paymentech  streamline provided by the royal bank of scotland group  vital processing services and others 
our commerce engine is designed to meet the transaction processing demands of our customers in a secure  fast  efficient  reliable  scalable and interoperable manner and was designed to scale rapidly to balance and handle peak transaction processing loads 
additional commerce engine servers can be readily added to accommodate increased customer demand 
commerce services applications we have developed and licensed a set of software applications that perform the hosted services 
these services include credit card processing  electronic check processing  order decision management  gift and promotional certificates  bill me later payment service  payer authentication  paypal  cybersource advanced fraud screen enhanced by visa  tax services  delivery address verification  and export compliance 
these applications contain the rules and logic necessary to provide our hosted services to customers 
in many cases  execution of the applications are distributed among the commerce engine and database systems  enabling us to minimize interruptions during scheduled maintenance when enhancing or adding additional services to meet our customers needs 
order processing api using web services in  we introduced the cybersource order processing api to allow the secure and reliable communication of order data from our customers systems to cybersource systems 
the order processing api provides our customers with a way to send invoice data to cybersource for processing by any of the cybersource commerce services applications 
using industry standard web services technologies  including soap  xml  and ws security  the order processing api provides customers with an industry recognized implementation path allowing the order processing api to be built into customer order management applications 
the order processing api uses the data encryption standard  rsa public key cryptography and digital certificates to ensure secure signed communication of transaction data 
simple commerce messaging protocol we developed scmp to enable efficient and secure connections between our commerce engine systems and our customers systems 
in order to ensure secure messaging  scmp utilizes industry standards for secure communications including the data encryption standard  rsa public key cryptography and digital certificates 
scmp has been designed so that it can be integrated into virtually any commerce server platform 
client software our commerce services are invoked by a common programming interface residing on our customers commerce servers 
client software is provided for scmp and order processing api interfaces and can be easily installed by customers using pre built developer kits and application plug ins 
these developer kits are available for most popular internet programming 
table of contents environments  including asp com  
net  java and others  and for most operating systems  including windows nt  linux  and unix solaris  hp ux  ibm aix and others 
developer kits also come with samples that customers can use to quickly deploy cybersource services within their enterprises 
data centers and network access our data centers are located at facilities in santa clara  california  mesa  arizona  london  england and tokyo  japan 
these secure data center facilities contain our servers  network firewalls  routers and other technology necessary to provide high availability transaction services and connectivity to the internet  our customers and processing partners

these points of presence  through controlled route announcements to providers such as at t  uu net  sprint  glbx  cable wireless  verio  abovenet  telia and level communications  enable us to provide direct  rapid and reliable access to our suite of services 
industry standards the implementation of our architecture for hosted services is based on and complies with widely accepted industry standards 
for example  the commerce engine utilizes components from industry leaders such as cisco  hewlett packard  ibm  microsoft  rsa data security  sun microsystems and sybase 
adherence to industry standards provides compatibility with existing applications  ease of modification  and reduces the need for software modules to be rewritten over time  thus protecting our customers investments 
enterprise software cybersource payment manager the cybersource payment manager product is based on modular systems architecture that allows this server to be installed into large customer infrastructures where a dedicated payment gateway interface will be used 
cybersource payment manager is designed as a three layer software architecture well suited for enterprise deployment 
these layers include the multiple sales channel interface  core server  and database 
the cybersource payment manager core server supports a common programming interface that can be adapted to multiple sales channel enterprise systems 
these sales systems could be used in conjunction with a call center in order to accept orders through an interactive voice response unit  from a web server using hypertext transfer protocol  from a point of sale terminal  or from a wireless application protocol device 
this architecture supports our belief that enterprises will demand a payment server capable of supporting multiple  independent sales channels  and that the enterprise sees significant benefit in being able to manage and control a single transaction payment platform 
the database layer is based on a standard structured query language sql interface  offering a choice of implementations with any of the standard relational database management systems rdbms on the market

back end database connectivity is provided through the java database connectivity jdbc application programming interface  an integral part of the jee standard 
currently supported databases are ibm db  microsoft sql server and oracle rdbms 
the architecture is extensible through a standards based xml developer api  allowing our professional services organization or the customer to build custom plug ins that can communicate with other external data sources 
these data sources can provide additional information about the customer s order  allowing more flexibility in determining associated risk 
standard plug ins available from cybersource connect decision manager custom edition to all of our hosted services  to cybersource payment manager  as well as third party services 

table of contents product development our product development team is responsible for the design  development  and release of our software and core infrastructure for services 
we have a well defined software development methodology that we believe enables us to deliver software services that satisfy real business needs for the global market while meeting commercial quality expectations 
we emphasize quality assurance throughout our development lifecycle 
we believe that a strong emphasis placed on analysis and design early in the project lifecycle reduces the number and costs of defects that may be found in later stages 
when appropriate  we utilize third parties to expand the capacity and technical expertise of our internal product development organization 
on occasion  we have licensed third party technology that we feel provides the strongest technical alternative 
we believe this approach shortens time to market without compromising our competitive position or product quality 
as of december   we employed persons in our product development department 
intellectual property our success depends upon our proprietary technology and licensed technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we have been issued four patents and have eleven patent applications pending 
the first issued patent  for a method and system for controlling distribution of software in a multi tiered distribution chain  expires in april the second issued patent  for a method and system for detecting fraud in a credit card transaction over the internet  expires in july the third issued patent  for a non extensible thin server that generates user interfaces via browser  expires in april the fourth issued patent  for a method and system for delivering digital products electronically  expires in november we have pending patent applications covering cryptography  digital delivery  stored value  electronic gift certificate processing  electronic check processing  and enhancements to our fraud screening and digital delivery systems 
we investigate  define and prepare applications for new patents as a part of the standard product development cycle 
our engineering management team meets on a regular basis to harvest new inventions from the engineering department 
we cannot assure that any patent application that we file will issue as a patent  and we cannot assure that any patent issued to us will not be held invalid or unenforceable based on prior art or for any other reason 
we believe that numerous patent applications relating to the internet commerce field have been filed or have issued as patents 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we become aware of one or more patents of third parties that we choose to evaluate for a variety of purposes 
these purposes may include determining the general contents of patents  reviewing the technological developments of their assignees and determining whether our technology may overlap 
we have not conducted searches to determine whether any of our services or technology could be alleged to infringe upon any patent rights of any third party 
we cannot assure that none of our products  services  and technology infringes any patent of any third party 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  contractors  vendors  potential customers and alliances  and our license agreements with our customers  with respect to our software  services  documentation and other proprietary information  contain confidentiality obligations 
despite these precautions  third parties could reverse engineer  copy or otherwise obtain our technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
while we police the use of our services and technology through online monitoring and functions designed into scmp and our commerce engine  an unauthorized third party may nevertheless gain unauthorized access to our services or pirate our software 
we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our intellectual property or software exists 
software piracy is a prevalent problem in our industry 
effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
we cannot assure that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our services  or design around any intellectual property rights we hold 
from time to time we may receive notice of claims of infringement of other parties intellectual property rights 
as the number of services in our market increases and functionalities overlap  companies such as ours may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
any infringement claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  diversion of technical and management personnel  or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements 
such licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents operations our operations department is responsible for the hours a day  days a week  days a year management  support  and data security for our global data centers and technology infrastructure 
we support and manage the transaction services business with enterprise class technologies and tools 
these technologies and tools are deployed and managed by strict adherence to proven operational principles  processes  and procedures

the company s performance in was graded by omega management through quarterly calls and web surveys to customers using cybersource s hosted suite of payment and risk management services 
as of december  we employed persons in customer support 
sales and marketing we target prospective customers worldwide through a direct sales force as well as reseller and referral programs 
our indirect sales channel is divided into resellers  managed commerce providers  and referral allies 
we have contractual relationships with these companies that range from referral relationships to reselling our software and services 
resellers our resellers provide our software and services as part of their larger offering portfolio and facilitate the sale and billing of our services 
resellers are authorized to sell our hosted services and support services 
our resellers include banks  small business resellers  and payment service providers such as bank of america  first data merchant services  miva  a division of findwhat 
com  paymentech  as well as a number of smaller partners 
managed commerce providers mcps managed commerce providers typically host customized and turnkey storefronts for online businesses 
mcps manage the entire customer relationship including operations  support  and billing 
mcps include internet service providers  application service providers  and specialized systems integrators 
our mcp partners include auctionanything  capitol advantage  channelwave  comergent  crimson bow  graphtek  radquest  and uniteu 
referral allies these are companies with which we have referral agreements  structured with or without monetary incentives

as of december   we had a total of employees in sales and marketing worldwide and an additional professional service consultants 

table of contents competition the market for our products and services is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
our primary source of competition comes from businesses that develop their own internal  custom made systems 
such businesses typically make large initial investments to develop custom made systems and therefore  may be less likely to adopt outside services or vendor developed online commerce transaction processing software 
we also face competition from developers of other systems for online commerce transaction processing such as e one global an affiliate of first data corporation  fair isaac  lightbridge  paymetrics  retail decisions  trintech and verisign 
in addition  visa and mastercard offer internet payment authentication programs with password protection that are designed to reduce the potential for unauthorized card use on the internet  which may compete with our fraud screen services 
furthermore  other companies  including financial services and credit companies such as first data corporation may enter the market and provide competing services 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products and services on terms favorable to us 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future services obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other commerce infrastructure providers  thereby increasing the ability of their solutions to address the needs of our prospective customers 
our current and potential competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future channel partners  thereby limiting our ability to sell services through these channels 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require the reduction of the prices of our offerings  either of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we compete on the basis of certain factors  including system and product reliability  product performance  domain expertise  sales channels  operating environments and applications supported  ease of implementation and integration  time to market  customer support  and  price 
presently  we believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
however  the market for our solutions is rapidly evolving and we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
employees as of december   we had a total of employees  including employees in professional services  sales and marketing  employees in product development  employees in operations and customer support and employees in general and administrative services 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider employee relations to be good 
regulations the following regulations may adversely affect our business now or in the future fair credit reporting act 
because our fraud screening system assesses the probability of fraud in a card not present credit card transaction  we may be deemed a consumer reporting agency under the fair credit reporting act 
as a precaution  we have implemented processes that we believe will enable us to comply with the act if we were deemed a consumer reporting agency 
complying with the act requires us to provide information about personal data stored by us 
failure to comply with the act could result in claims being made against us by individual consumers and the federal trade commission 
export control regulations 
current export control regulations prohibit the export of strong encryption technology without a license unless exempt from license requirements  thereby preventing us from using stronger 
table of contents encryption technology to protect the security of data being transmitted to and from internet merchants outside of the united states 
we have obtained a license to use bit encryption technology with our international merchants 
furthermore  we believe that our products and services fall under certain licensing exemptions as financial products 
item properties facilities our primary offices are located in approximately  square feet of space in mountain view  california  under an amended lease expiring in december during december  we consolidated the under utilized space in our mountain view facility and used approximately  square feet from january through december during december  we reviewed our future facility needs and determined that our forecasted growth for and beyond would require the utilization of certain currently unoccupied space 
as a result  we extended the lease on our mountain view facility through in addition  we occupy field sales offices in various cities throughout the united states 
we also maintain sales and support offices in leased space in reading  united kingdom 
item legal proceedings in july and august  various class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court  southern district of new york  against us  our chairman and ceo  a former officer  and four brokerage firms that served as underwriters in our initial public offering 
the actions were filed on behalf of persons who purchased our stock issued pursuant to or traceable to the initial public offering during the period from june  through december  the action alleges that our underwriters charged secret excessive commissions to certain of their customers in return for allocations of our stock in the offering 
the two individual defendants are alleged to be liable because of their involvement in preparing and signing the registration statement for the offering  which allegedly failed to disclose the supposedly excessive commissions 
on december   an amended complaint was filed in one of the actions to expand the purported class to persons who purchased our stock issued pursuant to or traceable to the follow on public offering during the period from november  through december  the lawsuit filed against us is one of several hundred lawsuits filed against other companies based on substantially similar claims 
on april   a consolidated amended complaint was filed to consolidate all of the complaints and claims into one case 
the consolidated amended complaint alleges claims that are virtually identical to the amended complaint filed on december  and the original complaints 
in october  our officer and a former officer that were named in the amended complaint were dismissed without prejudice 
in july  we  along with other issuer defendants in the case  filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint with prejudice 
on february   the court issued a written decision denying the motion to dismiss with respect to cybersource 
on july   a committee of our board of directors conditionally approved a proposed partial settlement with the plaintiffs in this matter 
the settlement would provide  among other things  a release of us and of the individual defendants for the conduct alleged in the action to be wrongful in the amended complaint 
we would agree to undertake other responsibilities under the partial settlement  including agreeing to assign away  not assert  or release certain potential claims we may have against our underwriters 
any direct financial impact of the proposed settlement is expected to be borne by our insurers 
the committee agreed to approve the settlement subject to a number of conditions  including the participation of a substantial number of other issuer defendants in the proposed settlement  the consent of our insurers to the settlement  and the completion of acceptable final settlement documentation 
furthermore  the settlement is subject to a hearing on fairness and final approval by the court overseeing the ipo litigations 
while there can be no assurances as to the outcome of the lawsuit  we do not presently believe that an adverse outcome in the lawsuit would have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
on august   we filed suit in the northern district of california against retail decisions  inc red us and retail decisions plc red uk collectively  red  case no 
civ  alleging that red infringes our us patent no 
 the patent 
we served red us with the complaint on august   and we served red uk with the complaint on august  on september   red responded to our complaint 
red filed a motion to stay the case for days pending a determination by the us patent and trademark office pto as to whether it will grant red s request that the pto re examine the patent 
red also filed a motion for a more definite statement by us with respect to our allegation that red is willfully infringing the patent 
in addition  red uk filed a motion to dismiss the action against it on the ground that it is not subject to personal jurisdiction in the northern district of california 
on october   red filed a request for re examination with the pto  based on prior art red discovered that allegedly invalidates the patent 
on october   we filed an opposition to red s motion to stay the case for days and an opposition to red s motion for a more definite statement with respect to willful infringement 
based on red uk s representation that red us is the sole entity that develops  operates  and distributes the ebitguard service  we agreed to dismiss red uk while reserving the right to reinstitute action against red uk in the event we later discover that red uk is subject to the court s personal jurisdiction 
in return  red uk agreed that if we later establish that personal jurisdiction existed  we could re file against red uk in this action without prejudice to our damages claim

we commenced operations in march as a division of beyond 
com 
on december   beyond 
com transferred assets and liabilities related to its commerce transaction processing services division to us 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and through december  had incurred cumulative losses of approximately million 
we derive our revenues from monthly commerce transaction processing fees  support service fees  professional services and the sale of enterprise software licenses and related maintenance 
transaction revenues are recognized in the period in which the transactions occur 
professional services revenue and support service fees are recognized as the related services are provided and costs are incurred 
enterprise software license revenue is recognized when the contract is signed  the software is delivered and the fee is fixed and determinable  and determined to be collectible 
enterprise software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
for each of the years ended december   and  no customer accounted for more than of revenues 
given the fluctuations in headcount and other expenses prior to  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results for those periods  including our gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues  are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and statement of position  software revenue recognition  sop  as amended 
sab and sop require that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgments regarding the collectibility of fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
in accordance with sop as amended  we had recognized enterprise software license and maintenance revenue when all elements of a contract had been delivered 
for the periods through september   for enterprise software arrangements where maintenance was the only undelivered element  we had recognized the entire contract ratably over the term of the maintenance period as vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for license or maintenance revenue had not been established 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we changed our maintenance pricing and established vsoe of fair value for new maintenance arrangements 
as a result of establishing vsoe of fair value for maintenance revenue  effective october   we recognize software license revenue in the period in which the contract is signed  the software is delivered and the fee is collectible 
we use the residual method of accounting as permitted by statement of position sop to recognize revenue when a software license includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe exists for all undelivered elements 
we allocate revenue to each element based on its fair value as determined by vsoe 
we defer revenue for any undelivered elements and recognize the deferred revenue when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed 
in addition  through september   we continued to ratably recognize enterprise software revenue that had previously been deferred prior to the establishment of vsoe of fair value for maintenance revenue  while also recording enterprise software revenue relating to new agreements under the residual method of accounting in accordance with sop we derive a significant portion of our professional services revenue from fixed price contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
professional services revenue is recognized separately from enterprise software and transaction processing fees because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined by sop these services are accounted for separately from enterprise software and transaction processing fees as they are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software  and are available services from other vendors 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
estimates are made regarding time to complete the projects and revisions to estimates are reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy obligations under the contracts  then future professional service margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 

table of contents restructuring charges during each of the fiscal years  and  we recorded significant charges in connection with our restructuring plans as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
these restructuring charges included estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlement of contractual obligations  primarily facilities related operating leases  resulting from our actions 
we had estimated facility exit costs for certain under utilized facilities and had made assumptions regarding a sublessee s future rental rate  as well as the amount of time required to identify a sublessee 
in december  we reviewed our future facility needs and determined that our forecasted growth would require the utilization of unoccupied space in our mountain view facility previously vacated as part of our restructuring plan 
as a result  we extended the lease on our mountain view facility through and reversed the remaining balance of previously recorded restructuring charges related to this facility 
our restructuring charges and subsequent reversal would have been higher had we assumed a lower future rental rate or longer period of time required to identify a sublessee 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments as well as for potential sales returns 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
these estimates are based on historical bad debt experience and other known factors 
if the historical data we used to determine these estimates does not properly reflect future losses  additional allowances may be required 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these proceedings as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accruals required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  as of december   we do not believe our current proceedings will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or as a result of the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings

we also recorded facility related restructuring charges of approximately in during  we closed our st 
louis  missouri facility  exited certain under utilized space in our mountain view  california and austin  texas facilities and consolidated our data centers 
during  we reassessed our initial estimate of probable costs and the sublease timeline associated with subleasing excess leased facilities 
the reassessment was prompted by a further decline in the real estate market in the cities where those facilities are located 
after considering information provided to us by our real estate advisors  we concluded it was probable these facilities could not be subleased at rates originally considered nor could they be subleased in the timeframe originally planned 
as a result  we recorded an additional charge of million relating to the facilities located in mountain view  california and austin  texas 
this additional charge considered current lease rates for similar facilities as well as costs associated with the estimated added holding period through december during  we again reassessed our estimate of probable costs and the sublease timeline associated with subleasing excess leased facilities

loss on investment in joint venture 
on march   we entered into a joint venture agreement with japanese partners marubeni corporation and trans cosmos  inc to establish cybersource kk to provide commerce transaction services to the japanese market 
we maintain a majority controlling interest in cybersource kk  subject to certain veto rights granted to the partners which expire when cybersource kk achieves at least million in quarterly revenue 
the joint venture is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting until the veto rights granted to the partners as described above expire 
after such date  we expect to consolidate the financial position and results of operations of cybersource kk as of june   we had recognized losses to the extent of our historical investment  including million recognized in in  we made additional contributions to the joint venture totaling million  all of which were recorded as losses in the period the contribution occurred 
in  we made no additional contributions to the joint venture 
interest income expense  net 
interest income  net which consists of interest earnings on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to an increase in average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during as compared to as a result of our income from operations in and slightly higher investment yields 
we expect interest income to increase in due to anticipated higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances 
income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income tax expense of  in this provision consists of amounts accrued for our domestic federal and state alternative minimum income tax liability 
this provision is based upon our net income before income taxes and takes into consideration the utilization of our net operating loss carry forwards 
historically  
table of contents we have not recorded a provision for income tax expense because we had been generating net losses 
furthermore  we have not recorded an income tax benefit for prior years primarily due to continued substantial uncertainty regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
based upon available objective evidence  there has been sufficient uncertainty regarding the ability to realize our deferred tax assets which warrants a full valuation allowance in our financial statements 
the factors considered include prior losses and lack of carry back potential to realize our deferred tax assets 
based on our estimates  we believe the uncertainty regarding the ability to realize our deferred tax assets may diminish to the point where it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
at such point  we would reverse all or a portion of our valuation allowance which will result in an income tax benefit 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
if we are not able to use them  the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation s ownership change  as defined in the internal revenue code 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited if such an ownership change occurs

table of contents risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including in item  management s discussion and analysis  and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described herein we have a limited operating history and are subject to the risks encountered by early stage companies we have a limited operating history  and our business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties to which early stage companies are particularly exposed 
these risks include risks that the intense competition and rapid technological change in our industry could adversely affect market acceptance of our products and services  risks that we may not be able to fully utilize relationships with our strategic partners and indirect sales channels  risks that any fluctuations in our quarterly operating results will be significant relative to our revenues  and risks that we may not be able to adequately integrate acquired businesses 
these risks are discussed in more detail below 
we cannot assure you that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks and the risks detailed below 
the expected fluctuations of our quarterly results could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline we expect that our quarterly operating results will fluctuate significantly in the future based upon a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated market growth and our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our revenues are lower than we expect  our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  including the following changes in the number of transactions effected by our customers  especially as a result of seasonality  success of each customer s business  general economic conditions or regulatory requirements restricting our customers  our ability to attract new customers and to retain our existing customers  customer acceptance of new products and services we may offer  customer acceptance of our pricing model  customer acceptance of our software and our professional services offerings  the success of our sales and marketing programs  an interruption with one or more of our gateway processors and channel partners  seasonality of the retail sector  war or other international conflicts  and weakness in the general us economy and the lack of available capital for our customers and potential future customers 
other factors that may affect our quarterly results are set forth elsewhere in this section 
as a result of these factors  our revenues are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
due to the uncertainty surrounding our revenues and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our historical operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
our stock price may fluctuate substantially due to factors outside our control the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors outside our control  including the following the announcement of new products  services or enhancements by our competitors  
table of contents quarterly variations in our competitors results of operations  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  developments in our industry  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
these factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the intense competition in our industry could reduce or eliminate the demand for our products and services the market for our products and services is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
our primary source of competition comes from online merchants that develop custom systems 
these online merchants  who have made large initial investments to develop custom systems  may be less likely to adopt an outsourced transaction processing strategy or purchase our software 
we also face competition from developers of other systems for commerce transaction processing such as e one global an affiliate of first data corporation  fair  isaac  lightbridge  paymetrics  retail decisions  trintech and verisign 
in addition  visa and mastercard have announced an internet payment authentication process with password protection which is designed to reduce the potential for unauthorized card use on the internet  which may compete with our fraud screen services 
further  other companies  including financial services and credit companies such as first data corporation may enter the market and provide competing services 
in the future  we may also compete with large internet centric companies that derive a significant portion of their revenues from e commerce and may offer  or provide a means for others to offer  e commerce transaction services 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products and services on terms favorable to us 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products and services obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
for example  visa and mastercard have introduced cardholder authentication solutions that  if widely adopted by consumers  may reduce demand for our fraud screening services 
our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other solution providers  thereby increasing their ability to address the needs of our existing or prospective customers 
our current and potential competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future channel partners  thereby limiting our ability to sell products and services through these channels 
we expect that competitive pressures may result in the reduction of our prices or our market share or both  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have a history of losses  may incur future losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve ongoing profitability we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
we incurred net losses of million in  million in  million in and million in as of december   we had incurred cumulative losses of million 
fiscal year has been our only profitable year 
we cannot give any assurances that we will realize sufficient revenues  and sufficiently limit expenses  to achieve ongoing profitability 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions and our business could be materially adversely affected if we fail to adequately integrate acquired businesses as part of our future business strategy  we may pursue strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies that would provide additional product or service offerings  additional industry expertise  a broader client base or an expanded geographic presence 
if we do not successfully integrate a strategic acquisition  or if the benefits of the transaction do not meet the expectation of financial or industry analysts  the market price of our common stock may decline 
any future acquisition could result in the use of significant amounts of cash  dilutive issuances of equity securities  or the incurrence of debt or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired company  risks of entering markets in which we have either no or limited prior experiences  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and 
table of contents the potential loss of key employees of an acquired company 
potential system failures and lack of capacity issues could negatively affect demand for our services our ability to deliver services to our merchants depends on the uninterrupted operation of our commerce transaction processing systems 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from denial of service attacks  computer viruses  war  earthquake  fire  flood and other manmade or natural disasters  and power loss  telecommunications or data network failure  operator negligence  improper operation by employees  physical and electronic break ins and similar events 
despite the fact that we have implemented redundant servers in third party hosting centers located in santa clara  california  and mesa  arizona  we may still experience service interruptions for the reasons listed above and a variety of other reasons 
if our redundant servers are not available  we may not have sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for resulting losses 
we have experienced periodic interruptions  affecting all or a portion of our systems  which we believe will continue to occur from time to time 
for example  on november   our services were unavailable for approximately ten hours due to an internal system problem 
we have also subsequently experienced service interruptions of lesser duration 
in addition  any interruption in our systems that impairs our ability to provide services could damage our reputation and reduce demand for our services 
our success also depends on our ability to grow  or scale  our commerce transaction systems to accommodate increases in the volume of traffic on our systems  especially during peak periods of demand 
we may not be able to anticipate increases in the use of our systems or successfully expand the capacity of our network infrastructure 
our inability to expand our systems to handle increased traffic could result in system disruptions  slower response times and other difficulties in providing services to our merchant customers  which could materially harm our business 
a breach of our ecommerce security measures could reduce demand for our services a requirement of the continued growth of e commerce is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
we rely on public key cryptography  an encryption method that utilizes two keys  a public and a private key  for encoding and decoding data  and digital certificate technology  or identity verification  to provide the security and authentication necessary for secure transmission of confidential information 
regulatory and export restrictions may prohibit us from using the most secure cryptographic protection available and thereby expose us to an increased risk of data interception 
a party who is able to circumvent security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or interrupt our operations 
any compromise or elimination of security could reduce demand for our services 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and to address any problems they may cause 
concerns over the security of the internet and other online transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet and other online services generally  and the web in particular  especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
because our activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our security measures may not prevent security breaches  and failure to prevent security breaches may disrupt our operations 
we could incur chargeback or merchant fraud losses cybersource has potential liability for certain transactions processed primarily through our global payment suite if the payments associated with such transactions are rejected  refused  or returned for reasons such as consumer fraud or billing disputes 
for instance  if a billing dispute between a merchant and payer is not ultimately resolved in favor of the merchant  the disputed transaction may be charged back to the merchant s bank and credited to the payer s account 
if the charged back amount cannot be recovered from the merchant s account  or if the merchant refuses or is financially unable to reimburse its bank for the charged back amount  we may bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the payer s bank 
we could also incur fraud losses as a result of merchant fraud 
merchant fraud occurs when a merchant  rather than a customer  intentionally uses a stolen or counterfeit card  card number  or other bank account number to process a false sales transaction  or knowingly fails to deliver merchandise or services in an otherwise valid transaction 
we may be responsible for any losses for certain transactions if we are unable to collect from the merchant 

table of contents we have established systems and procedures designed to detect and reduce the impact of consumer fraud and merchant fraud  but we cannot assure you that these measures are or will be effective 
to date  we have not incurred any significant losses relating to charged back transactions 
changes in accounting standards regarding stock option plans could limit the desirability of granting stock options  which could harm our ability to attract and retain employees  and could also reduce our profitability the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued its final standard that will require us to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants beginning with our third fiscal quarter of this regulation will negatively impact our earnings 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  new regulations implemented by the nasdaq national market requiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant stock options to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we are not able to fully utilize relationships with our sales alliances  we may experience lower revenue growth and higher operating costs our future growth will depend in part on the success of our relationships with existing and future sales alliances that market our products and services to their merchant accounts 
if these relationships are not successful or do not develop as quickly as we anticipate  our revenue growth may be adversely affected 
accordingly  we may have to increase our sales and marketing expenses in an attempt to secure additional merchant accounts 
our market is subject to rapid technological change and to compete we must continually enhance our systems to comply with evolving standards to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and features of our products and services and the underlying network infrastructure 
the internet and the e commerce industry are characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies  and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our technology and systems obsolete 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to both internally develop and license leading technologies to enhance our existing products and services and develop new products and services 
we must continue to address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our merchants  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
the development of proprietary technology involves significant technical and business risks 
we may fail to develop new technologies effectively or to adapt our proprietary technology and systems to merchant requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions  merchant requirements or emerging industry standards  our business would be materially harmed 
the demand for our products and services could be negatively affected by a reduced growth of e commerce or delays in the development of the internet infrastructure sales of goods and services over the internet do not currently represent a significant portion of overall sales of goods and services 
we depend on the growing use and acceptance of the internet as an effective medium of commerce by merchants and customers in the united states and internationally 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet is a relatively recent development 
in particular  the sale of goods and services over the internet has gained acceptance more slowly outside of the united states 
we cannot be certain that acceptance and use of the internet will continue to develop or that a sufficiently broad base of merchants and consumers will adopt  and continue to use  the internet as a medium of commerce 
the increase in the significance of the internet as a commercial marketplace may occur more slowly than anticipated for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies and performance improvements 
if the number of internet users  or the use of internet resources by existing users  continues to grow  it may overwhelm the existing internet infrastructure 
delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity could also have a detrimental effect 
these factors could result in slower response times or adversely affect usage of the internet  resulting in lower numbers of commerce transactions and lower demand for our products and services 

table of contents if we lose key personnel  we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our key management personnel  including william s 
mckiernan  our chief executive officer  and other key members of management because of their experience and knowledge regarding the development  special opportunities and challenges of our business 
none of our current key employees is subject to an employment contract 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key employees in the future 
we may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology and may be infringing upon third party intellectual property rights our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  contractors  vendors and potential customers and alliances 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
we cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products and services or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
we also cannot assure you that third parties will not claim that the technology employed in providing our current or future products and services infringe upon their rights 
we have not conducted any search to determine whether any of our products and services or technologies may be infringing upon patent rights of third parties 
as the number of products and services in our market increases and functionalities increasingly overlap  companies such as ours may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
in addition  these claims also might require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
any infringement claims  with or without merit  could absorb significant management time and lead to costly litigation 
if required to do so  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements  or obtain them on terms acceptable to us 
we may become subject to government regulation and legal uncertainties that would adversely affect our financial results we are not currently subject to direct regulation by any domestic or foreign governmental agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally  export control laws and laws or regulations directly applicable to e commerce 
however  due to the increasing usage of the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be applicable or may be adopted in the future with respect to conducting business over the internet covering issues such as taxes  user privacy  pricing  content  right to access personal data  copyrights  distribution  and characteristics and quality of products and services 
for example  we believe that our fraud screen service may require us to comply with the fair credit reporting act the act 
as a precaution  we have implemented processes that we believe will enable us to comply with the act if we were deemed a consumer reporting agency 
complying with the act requires us to provide information about personal data stored by us 
failure to comply with the act could result in claims being made against us by individual consumers and the federal trade commission 
furthermore  the growth and development of the market for e commerce may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business online 
the adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet or other online services  which could  in turn  decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 
the applicability of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights  encryption and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel  export or import matters and personal privacy to the internet is uncertain 
the vast 
table of contents majority of laws were adopted prior to the broad commercial use of the internet and related technologies 
as a result  they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes to these laws intended to address these issues  including some recently proposed changes in the united states regarding taxation and encryption and in the european union regarding contract formation and privacy  could create uncertainty in the internet marketplace and impose additional costs and other burdens 
these uncertainties  costs and burdens could reduce demand for our products and services or increase the cost of doing business due to increased litigation costs or increased service delivery costs 
our international business exposes us to additional foreign risks products and services provided to merchants outside the united states accounted for  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
in march  we entered into a joint venture agreement with japanese partners marubeni corporation and trans cosmos  inc and established cybersource kk to provide commerce transaction services to the japanese market 
conducting business outside of the united states is subject to additional risks that may affect our ability to sell our products and services and result in reduced revenues  including changes in regulatory requirements  reduced protection of intellectual property rights  evolving privacy laws in europe  the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and war  political or economic instability or constraints on international trade 
in addition  some software contains encryption technology that renders it subject to export restrictions and we may become liable to the extent we violate these restrictions 
we might not successfully market  sell and distribute our products and services in local markets and we cannot be certain that one or more of these factors will not materially adversely affect our future international operations  and consequently  our business  financial condition and operating results 
also  sales of our products and services conducted through our subsidiary in the united kingdom are denominated in pounds sterling 
we may experience fluctuations in revenues or operating expenses due to fluctuations in the value of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar 
we do not currently enter into transactions with the specific purpose to hedge against currency exchange fluctuations 
the anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation may make a change in control more difficult to finalize  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
these provisions may allow the board of directors to prevent changes in our management and controlling interests 
under delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures in the future 
one anti takeover provision that we have is the ability of our board of directors to determine the terms of preferred stock and issue preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock 
our certificate of incorporation allows the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
as of december   there are no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
however  because the rights and preferences of any series of preferred stock may be set by the board of directors in its sole discretion without approval of the holders of the common stock  the rights and preferences of this preferred stock may be superior to those of the common stock 
accordingly  the rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected 
our fraud detection services and marketing agreement with visa usa can be terminated in july  we entered into a new agreement with visa usa to jointly develop and promote the cybersource advanced fraud screen service enhanced by visa for use in the united states 
under the terms of the agreement  visa has agreed to promote and market the new product to its member financial institutions and internet merchants 
the agreement expires in july  but can be terminated by either party after the first year with ninety days prior written notice 
after july  the agreement renews automatically for additional periods of one year  unless terminated by either party 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires  effective for our fiscal  annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting 
table of contents firm addressing these assessments 
the threshold for what constitutes a significant deficiency in internal control under section of the sarbanes oxley act has been set quite low and  during the course of our annual testing  we may find one or more material weaknesses or significant deficiencies 
furthermore  there is no guarantee that we will be able to remedy any deficiencies we may find in a cost effective manner and in time to meet the deadline imposed by the sarbanes oxley act for compliance with the requirements of section in addition  if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we provide our services to customers primarily in the united states and  to a lesser extent  in europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
all sales are currently made in us dollars or pound sterling 
a strengthening of the us dollar or the pound sterling could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
due to the nature of our cash equivalents and short term investments  which are primarily money market funds  government bonds and commercial paper  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure
