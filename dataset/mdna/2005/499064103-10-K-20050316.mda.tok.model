introduction business overview we are a truckload carrier based in phoenix  arizona 
we transport general commodities for shippers throughout the united states  generally focusing our operations on short to medium lengths of haul 
we provide regional truckload carrier services from our regional dry van operations centers located throughout the united states and one temperature controlled subsidiary located in phoenix 
over the past five years we have achieved substantial revenue and income growth 
during this period  our revenue  before fuel surcharge  grew at a compounded annual rate from million in to million in  and our net income grew at a compounded annual rate from million in to million in operating and growth strategy our operating strategy is focused on the following core elements focusing on regional operations 
we seek to operate primarily in high density  predictable traffic lanes in selected geographic regions 
we believe our regional operations allow us to obtain greater freight volumes and higher revenue per mile  and also enhance safety and driver recruitment and retention 
maintaining operating efficiencies and controlling costs 
we focus almost exclusively on operating in distinct geographic and shipping markets in order to achieve increased penetration of targeted service areas and higher equipment utilization in dense traffic lanes 
we actively seek to control costs by  among other things  operating a modern equipment fleet  maintaining a high driver to nondriver employee ratio  and regulating vehicle speed 
providing a high level of customer service 
we seek to compete on the basis of service in addition to price  and offer our customers a broad range of services to meet their specific needs  including multiple pick ups and deliveries  on time pick ups and deliveries within narrow time frames  dedicated fleet and personnel  and specialized driver training 

table of contents using technology to enhance our business 
our tractors are equipped with a satellite based tracking and communications system to permit us to stay in contact with our drivers  obtain load position updates  and provide our customers with freight visibility 
a significant number of our trailers are equipped with tracking technology to allow us to manage our trailers more effectively  maintain a low trailer to tractor ratio  efficiently assess detention fees  and minimize cargo loss 
the primary source of our revenue growth has been our ability to open and develop new regional operations centers in selected geographic areas and operate them at or near our targeted margins within a relatively short period of time 
during  we established additional regional dry van operations centers in las vegas  nevada  carlisle  pennsylvania  and lakeland  florida  and created a temperature controlled subsidiary based in phoenix  arizona 
based on our current expectations concerning the economy  we anticipate opening three or four additional regional operations centers in and adding approximately new tractors system wide during the year 
as part of our growth strategy  we also periodically evaluate acquisition opportunities and we will continue to consider acquisitions that meet our financial and operating criteria 
revenue and expenses we primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for our services 
we enhance our revenue by charging for tractor and trailer detention  loading and unloading activities  and other specialized services  as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the general level of economic activity in the united states  inventory levels  specific customer demand  the level of capacity in the trucking industry  and driver availability 
historically  excess capacity in the transportation industry has limited our ability to improve rates 
from into  economic activity in the united states was somewhat sluggish  which limited to some extent our ability to obtain rate increases during that period  but also resulted in decreased truck capacity in relation to demand as many trucking companies failed  contracted  or limited their growth 
beginning in and throughout  however  the united states economy experienced strong growth  which  together with tighter capacity  contributed to higher freight rates throughout much of the industry  including a improvement in average revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge from to at knight 
if the economy continues at the pace  we expect continued tight capacity  coupled with stronger freight demand  to continue to provide us with better than historical pricing power 
the main factors that impact our profitability in terms of expenses are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which are recorded under purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs are the acquisition and financing of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and 
del del 
terminal facilities and the compensation of non driver personnel 
effectively controlling our expenses is an important element of assuring our profitability 
the primary measure we use to evaluate our profitability is operating ratio  excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge 
we view any operating ratio  whether for the company or any operations center  in excess of as unacceptable performance in the current environment 

table of contents recent results of operations and year end financial condition for the year ended december   our results of operations improved as follows versus the fiscal year revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased  to million from million  net income increased  to million from million  and net income per diluted share increased to from 
we believe the improvements in our profitability are attributable primarily to higher average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharge  our main measure of asset productivity  which increased to  in from  in this improvement was driven by a increase in average revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge to from  and a increase in average miles per tractor to  from  we believe these increases were attributable to stronger freight demand and a better rate environment in primarily due to continued growth in the us economy and a favorable relationship between demand and trucking capacity 
rate and mile improvements were partially offset by a increase in our percentage of non revenue miles to for from for the prior year  which was principally due to positioning of our revenue equipment in areas which allowed us to capitalize on the most favorable freight in terms of higher rates 
during  we grew our fleet by adding new tractors  and we periodically experienced temporary challenges attracting a sufficient number of drivers to optimize utilization of our expanding tractor fleet 
in response to this challenge  we placed additional emphasis on our driver recruiting and retention efforts 
this emphasis on recruiting and retention  combined with increases in driver compensation in totaling three cents per mile  which will affect our costs going forward  have resulted in nearly all of our trucks being fully seated at year end at december  our balance sheet reflected million in cash and cash equivalents  no debt  and shareholders equity of million 
for the year  we generated million in cash flow from operations and used million for purchases of property and equipment 
we did not have any off balance sheet operating leases at december 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of our expense items to total revenue and revenue  before fuel surcharge  for each of the three fiscal years indicated below 
fuel expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  is calculated using fuel expense  net of surcharge

a discussion of our results of operations for the periods to and to is set forth below 
fiscal compared to fiscal our total revenue for increased to million from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe the high variable cost nature of our business makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to million for up from million in this increase primarily resulted from the expansion of our fleet and customer base and increased volume from existing customers  continued market development from existing operations centers  the opening of three additional regional dry van operations centers and the establishment of a temperature controlled subsidiary in  as well as improved rates and utilization 
as a result of our expansion into new regions and improving freight demand  our tractor fleet grew to  tractors including owned by independent contractors as of december   from  tractors 
table of contents including owned by independent contractors as of december  this growth in our fleet  coupled with a increase in average revenue per tractor per week in over  resulted in the significant period over period improvement in revenue 
salaries  wages and benefits expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in from in  primarily due to increases in driver pay rates of approximately 
per mile during  as well as an increase in the percentage of our total fleet operated by company drivers  as opposed to independent contractors 
amounts paid to independent contractors for hauling freight are recorded on the purchased transportation line of our statements of income 
as of december   of our fleet was operated by company drivers  compared to as of december  for our drivers  we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claims accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  remained essentially constant as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  at for and in this was mainly due to improved collection of fuel surcharge revenue during  which offset higher fuel prices 
the company maintains a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs 
for the year ended december   fuel surcharge was million  compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of total revenue  including fuel surcharge  fuel expense increased to for from in as a result of higher fuel prices 
we believe that higher fuel prices may continue to adversely affect our operating expenses throughout  and that continued unrest in the middle east and other areas could have a significant adverse effect on fuel prices 
operations and maintenance expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for from in this increase was primarily due to increased costs for driver recruiting expenses 
independent contractors pay for the maintenance on their own vehicles 
insurance and claims expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for  compared to for  primarily as a result of an increase in insurance premiums and self insurance claims costs incurred by the company 
operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for from for the decrease resulted primarily from improvements in average revenue per tractor per week in  which more efficiently covered these costs 
communications expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained constant at for both and depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  increased to for from in this increase was primarily related to an increase in the percentage of our company fleet comprised of purchased vehicles

at december   of our company fleet was comprised of purchased vehicles  compared to at december  lease expense for revenue equipment  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for  primarily as a result of a decrease in the percentage of the company fleet comprised of vehicles held under operating leases  as discussed above 
during  we exercised early buy out options on all of our tractors that were held under operating leases at the beginning of the year 
the equipment purchased upon termination of these operating leases was capitalized into our fleet during

our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations  and to a lesser extent lease financing arrangements  issuances of equity securities  and borrowings under our line of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase for was primarily the result of an increase in revenue coupled with an increase in our net income 

table of contents capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment  net of trade ins  office equipment  and land and leasehold improvements  totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures  net of trade ins  of approximately million for we expect these capital expenditures will be applied primarily to acquire new revenue equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the net proceeds of stock option exercises 
during  we paid our first quarterly dividend of 
per share on our common stock 
net cash used for financing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used for financing during these periods was primarily for the payments on our line of credit and long term debt  which was retired in full during the fourth quarter of at december   we did not have any outstanding debt 
we currently maintain a line of credit  which permits revolving borrowings and letters of credit totaling million 
at december   the line of credit consisted solely of issued but unused letters of credit totaling million 
historically this line of credit had been maintained at million 
however  due to our continued strong positive cash position  and in an effort to minimize bank fees  we do not believe a revolving credit facility or term loans are necessary to meet our current and anticipated near term cash needs 
we believe any necessary increase in our line of credit to provide for a revolving line or credit or term loans could be accomplished quickly as needed 
we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under our line of credit and were in compliance with these covenants at december   and as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents 
management believes we will be able to finance our near term needs for working capital over the next twelve months  as well as acquisitions of revenue equipment during such period  with cash balances and cash flows from operations 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  which may require us to incur debt or seek additional equity capital 
the availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock and several other factors over which we have limited control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
nevertheless  based on our recent operating results  current cash position  anticipated future cash flows  and sources of financing that we expect will be available to us  we do not expect that we will experience any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet transactions our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
like many other trucking companies  historically we have utilized operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment acquisitions 
at december   we had no tractors remaining under operating leases 
during  we exercised early buy out options on all tractors which remained under operating leases at december  lease payments in respect of such vehicles are reflected in our income statements in the line item lease expense revenue equipment 
our rental expense related to operating leases was million in  compared to million in 
table of contents tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of december   our contractual obligations and payments due by corresponding period for our short and long term operating expenses and other commitments 
payments in thousands due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years purchase obligations revenue equipment total purchase obligations revenue equipment represent the total purchase price under commitments to purchase tractors and trailers scheduled for delivery throughout critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect  or could affect  our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue  including fuel surcharges  upon delivery of a shipment 
depreciation 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is calculated by the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which ranges from five to thirty years  down to an estimated salvage value of the property and equipment  which ranges from to of the capitalized cost 
we periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our property and equipment based upon  among other things  our experience with similar assets  including gains or losses upon dispositions of such assets 
our determinations with respect to salvage values are based upon the expected market values of equipment at the end of the expected life 
we presently do not expect any decrease in the salvage values of our revenue equipment as a result of conditions in the used equipment market or otherwise 
we do not conduct fair value assessments of our capital assets in the ordinary course of business and  unless a triggering event under sfas occurs  we do not expect to do so in the future 
tires on revenue equipment purchased are capitalized as a part of the equipment cost and depreciated over the life of the vehicle 
replacement tires and recapping costs are expensed when placed in service 

table of contents claims accrual 
reserves and estimates for claims is another of our critical accounting policies 
the primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  collision and comprehensive  workers compensation  and employee medical expenses 
we maintain self insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self insured liabilities 
we also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self insurance amounts 
the claims reserves represent accruals for the estimated self insured portion of pending claims  including adverse development of known claims  as well as incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates are based on historical information  primarily our own claims experience and the experience of our third party administrator  along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change over time 
the significant level of our self insured retention for personal injury and property damage claims  currently at million  amplifies the importance and potential impact of these estimates 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if it were ever estimated that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to the company s profitable operations 
accordingly  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
in addition  we use various tax strategies to manage our short term and long term taxable income 
management judgments are involved in determining the effectiveness of such strategies 
seasonality in the transportation industry  results of operations frequently show a seasonal pattern  with lower revenue and higher operating expenses being common in the winter months 
seasonal variations may result from weather or from customer s reduced shipments after the busy winter holiday season 
because we operate significantly in western and southern united states  winter weather generally has not adversely affected our overall business 
continued expansion of our operations throughout the united states could expose us to greater operating variances due to periodic seasonal weather in other regions 
shortages of energy and related issues in california  and elsewhere in the western united states  could result in an adverse effect on our operations and demand for our services if these shortages continue or increase 
this risk also may exist in other regions in which we operate  depending upon availability of energy

this statement is effective for the company on july  the company is still evaluating the complete impact of this statement 
factors that may affect future results the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our business and growth outlook 
our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control 
our business is dependent on a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations  many of which are beyond our control 
the most significant of these factors are recessionary economic cycles  changes in customers inventory levels  excess tractor or trailer capacity  and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers and in regions of the country where we have a significant amount of business 
economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss  and we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also are affected by increases in interest rates  fuel prices  taxes  tolls  license and registration fees  insurance costs  and the rising costs of healthcare for our employees 
we could be affected by strikes or other work stoppages at our facilities or at customer  port  border  or other shipping locations 
in addition  we cannot predict the effects on the economy or consumer confidence of actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks  efforts to combat terrorism  military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state  or heightened security requirements 
enhanced security measures could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs 
our growth may not continue at historic rates 
we have experienced significant and rapid growth in revenue and profits since the inception of our business in there can be no assurance that our business will continue to grow in a similar fashion in the future or that we can effectively adapt our management  administrative  and operational systems to respond to any future growth 
further  there can be no assurance that our operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic conditions 

table of contents if the growth in our regional operations throughout the united states slows or stagnates  or if we are unable to commit sufficient resources to our regional operations  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition to our regional facilities in phoenix  arizona  we have established dry van regional operations centers throughout the united states in order to serve markets in these regions 
these regional operations require the commitment of additional revenue equipment and personnel  as well as management resources  for future development 
should the growth in our regional operations throughout the united states slow or stagnate  the results of our operations could be adversely affected 
we may encounter operating conditions in these new markets that differ substantially from those previously experienced in our western united states markets 
there can be no assurance that our regional operating strategy can be duplicated successfully in the other areas of the united states or that it will not take longer than expected or require a more substantial financial commitment than anticipated 
in addition  we have recently commenced operation of a refrigerated subsidiary as part of our growth strategy and are subject to the risks inherent in entering a new line of business  including but not limited to unfamiliarity with pricing  service  and operational issues  the risk that customer relationships may be difficult to obtain or that we may have to reduce rates to gain customer relationships  the risk that the specialized refrigerated equipment may not be adequately utilized  and the risk that cargo claims may exceed our past experience 
ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 
our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels  which could reduce our earnings 
for  our maximum self insured retention for auto liability is million per occurrence  which is a decrease from million in our maximum self insured retention for workers compensation remains constant at  per occurrence 
we maintain insurance with licensed insurance companies above the amounts for which we self insure 
our insurance policies for provide for excess liability coverage up to a total of million per occurrence 
if insurance premiums increase  the severity or number of claims to which we are exposed increase  or one or more claims exceed our coverage limits  our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
we currently reserve for anticipated losses and expenses associated with claims and regularly evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect actual experience 
however  ultimate results may differ from our estimates  which could result in losses above reserved amounts 
increased prices for  or increased costs of operating  new revenue equipment may materially and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
our growth has been made possible through the addition of new revenue equipment 
difficulty in financing or obtaining new revenue equipment for example  delivery delays from manufacturers could restrict future growth 
epa emissions control regulations require that diesel engines manufactured in october and thereafter must satisfy considerably more restrictive emissions standards 
furthermore  even more restrictive engine design requirements will take effect in in part to offset the costs of compliance with the epa engine design requirements  some manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices and further increases may result in connection with the implementation of the standards 
if new equipment prices increase more than anticipated  we may be required to increase our depreciation and financing costs and or retain some of our equipment longer  with a resulting increase in maintenance expenses 
to the extent we are unable to offset any such increases in expenses with rate increases or cost savings  our results of operations would be adversely affected 

table of contents in addition to increases in equipment costs  the epa compliant engines are generally less fuel efficient than those in later model tractors manufactured before october  and compliance with the epa standards could result in further declines in fuel economy 
to the extent we are unable to offset resulting increases in fuel expenses with higher rates or surcharge revenue  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
if fuel prices increase significantly  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are subject to risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside our control 
political events in the middle east  venezuela and elsewhere also may cause the price of fuel to increase 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of short term increases in fuel prices from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always fully offset the increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
difficulty in driver and independent contractor recruitment and retention may have a materially adverse affect on our business 
difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors  could have a materially adverse effect on our growth and profitability 
our independent contractors are responsible for paying for their own equipment  fuel  and other operating costs  and significant increases in these costs could cause them to seek higher compensation from us or seek other opportunities within or outside the trucking industry 
in addition  competition for drivers  which is always intense  increased during if a shortage of drivers should continue  or if we were unable to continue to attract and contract with independent contractors  we could be forced to limit our growth  experience an increase in the number of our tractors without drivers  which would lower our profitability  or be required to further adjust our driver compensation package  which could adversely affect our profitability if not offset by a corresponding increase in rates 
our operations are subject to various governmental regulations which limit our business and the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 
the dot and various state and local agencies exercise broad powers over our business  generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  and insurance requirements 
the dot has adopted revised hours of service regulations for drivers that became effective in january we believe that we minimized the economic impact of the new hours of service rules on our business through a combination of detention and other charges  internal training programs  and communication with our customers 
however  after nine months of operation under the revised hours of service regulations  citizens advocacy groups successfully challenged the regulations in court 
pending further action by the courts or the effectiveness of new rules  congress has enacted a law that extends the effectiveness of the revised hours of service rules until september  if driving hours are further restricted by new revisions to the hours of service rules  we could experience a reduction in driver miles that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the dot  including those relating to drug and alcohol testing 
we also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to other matters 
in addition to direct regulation by the dot and other agencies  our business also is subject to the effects of new tractor engine design requirements implemented by the epa such as those that became effective october   and are expected to become effective in which are discussed above under factors that may affect future results increased prices for  or increased costs of operating  new 
table of contents revenue equipment may materially and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
additional changes in the laws and regulations governing or impacting our industry could affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for  and the costs of providing  services to shippers 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials  underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of stormwater 
we operate in industrial areas  where truck terminals and other industrial facilities are located  and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage  and hazardous waste disposal  among others 
two of our terminal facilities are located adjacent to environmental superfund sites 
although we have not been named as a potentially responsible party in either case  we are potentially exposed to claims that we may have contributed to environmental contamination in the areas in which we operate 
we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities 
our phoenix facility is located on land identified as potentially having groundwater contamination resulting from the release of hazardous substances by persons who have operated in the general vicinity 
the area has been classified as a state superfund site 
we have been located at our phoenix facility since and  during such time  have not been identified as a potentially responsible party with regard to the groundwater contamination  and we do not believe that our operations have been a source of groundwater contamination 
our indianapolis property is located approximately of a mile east of reilly tar and chemical corporation reilly  a federal superfund site listed on the national priorities list for clean up 
the reilly site has known soil and groundwater contamination 
there also are other sites in the general vicinity of our indianapolis property that have known contamination 
environmental reports obtained by us have disclosed no evidence that activities on our indianapolis property have caused or contributed to the area s contamination 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances  or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 
we are highly dependent on a few major customers  the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of major customers 
for the year ended december   our top customers  based on revenue  accounted for approximately of our revenue  our top customers  approximately of our revenue  and our top customers  approximately of our revenue 
generally  we do not have long term contractual relationships with our major customers  and we cannot assure you that our customer relationships will continue as presently in effect 
a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we are dependent on computer and communications systems  and a systems failure could cause a significant disruption to our business 
our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems and infrastructure 
we currently maintain our computer system at our phoenix  arizona headquarters  along with computer equipment at our regional facilities 
our operations and those of our technology and communications service providers are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist attacks  internet failures  computer viruses  
table of contents and other events beyond our control 
although we are in the process of implementing an offsite back up facility for our systems to mitigate these risks  that facility may be subject to the same interruptions as may affect our phoenix headquarters 
we do not currently have the capability to switch over all of our systems to a back up facility immediately 
in the event of a significant system failure  our business could experience significant disruption until we fully implement our back up systems 
our investment in concentrek may not be successful and we may be forced to write off part or all of our investment 
in april  we invested approximately  to acquire a minority interest in concentrek  inc concentrek  a transportation logistics company  the remainder of which is owned by members of the knight family and concentrek s management 
we also have loaned funds to concentrek on a secured basis to fund a portion of its start up costs 
at december   the outstanding amount of these loans was approximately million 
if concentrek s financial position were to decline we could be forced to write down all or part of our investment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rate on debt and from changes in commodity prices 
under financial accounting reporting release number and sec rules and regulations  we are required to disclose information concerning market risk with respect to foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we have elected to make such disclosures  to the extent applicable  using a sensitivity analysis approach  based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
except as described below  we have not had occasion to use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and do not use them for either speculation or trading 
because our operations are confined to the united states  we are not subject to foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our line of credit or incur debt in the acquisition of revenue equipment 
we attempt to manage our interest rate risk by managing the amount of debt we carry 
at december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings 
in the opinion of management  an increase in short term interest rates could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition only if we incur substantial indebtedness and the interest rate increases are not offset by freight rate increases or other items 
management does not foresee or expect in the near future any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how that exposure is managed by us 
commodity price risk we also are subject to commodity price risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside our control 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of our short term fuel price increases from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always fully offset an increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
based upon our experience  we believe that we generally pass through to customers approximately to of fuel price increases

table of contents expense  net of fuel surcharge  represented of our total operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  compared to for the same period ending in we are party to three fuel hedging contracts relating to the price of heating oil on the new york mercantile exchange nymx that we entered into between october and february in connection with volume diesel fuel purchases 
if the price of heating oil on the nymx falls below per gallon we may be required to pay the difference between and the index price for million gallons per month for any selected twelve months through march   and for  gallons per month for the twelve months of at january   the price of heating oil on the nymx was for march contracts 
for each per gallon the price of heating oil would fall below per gallon during the relevant periods  our potential loss on the hedging contracts would be approximately million 
however  our net savings on fuel costs resulting from lower fuel prices under our volume diesel fuel purchase contracts would be approximately million  after taking the potential loss on the hedging contracts into consideration 
we have valued these items at fair value in the accompanying december  consolidated financial statements
