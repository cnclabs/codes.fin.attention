this compares to million  or per diluted share in key factors impacting the company s financial condition and results of operations for are summarized below 
total assets of the company increased to billion at the end of  or  from billion at the end of this strong growth is primarily reflective of increases in earning assets obtained through the two acquisitions during and strong loan production in existing markets 
shareowners equity for the same periods improved from million at the end of to million at the end of the company continues to be well capitalized with a tier capital ratio of 
net interest income in grew million  or over due to higher interest income reflective of earning asset growth through acquisitions and strong organic loan growth  and an improved deposit mix  partially offset by declining asset yields primarily attributable to earning asset re pricing 
the full year net interest margin of declined basis points from the comparable period in reflective of an basis point decline in earning asset yield partially offset by a basis point decline in the cost of funds 
noninterest income increased million  or  over due primarily to the million one time gain on the sale of the bank s credit card portfolio recognized in the third quarter 
gains were also realized in deposit service fees  data processing fees  asset management fees  and merchant fees that were partially offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues 
noninterest expense grew by million  or over higher expense for compensation  occupancy  professional fees  advertising  and intangibles were the primary reasons for the increase 
the integration of two acquisitions during the year  expansion of banking office locations  and the implementation of sarbanes oxley section compliance and testing were the primary contributing factors driving the increase

per diluted share  from the sale of the bank s credit card portfolio 
the increase in net income was primarily attributable to growth in operating revenues defined as the total of net interest income and noninterest income of  driven by a increase in net interest income and a increase in noninterest income 
a lower loan loss provision also enhanced net income 
the increase in net interest income primarily reflects growth in earning assets and an improved deposit mix 
the increase in noninterest income reflects higher deposit service fees  asset management fees  and a one time gain on the sale of the credit card portfolio 
the lower loan loss provision is reflective of a reduction in the overall risk of the loan portfolio due to the sale of the credit card portfolio

changes which are not solely due to volume changes or solely due to rate changes have been attributed to rate changes 
interest income includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments using a tax rate to adjust interest on tax exempt loans and securities to a taxable equivalent basis 
reflects difference in day year versus day year 
for the year  taxable equivalent interest income increased million  or  over  and decreased million  or  in over growth resulting from strong loan demand and two acquisitions was partially offset by lower yields on earning assets and a decline in short term funds and investment securities 
new loan production and repricing of existing earning assets produced a basis point reduction in the yield on earning assets  which declined from for to for this compares to an basis point reduction in over as shown in table  the loan portfolio was a significant contributor to the net increase in interest income 
interest expense increased 
million  or  over  and decreased million  or  in over the increase in was primarily a result of higher interest bearing liabilities attributable to the acquisitions and offset partially by the lower costs of funds 
the lower cost of funds resulted from a favorable shift in mix  as certificates of deposit generally a higher cost deposit product declined relative to total deposits 
certificates of deposit  as a percent of total average deposits  declined from in to in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in declined basis points compared to  primarily attributable to the favorable shift in mix 
the company s interest rate spread defined as the taxable equivalent yield on average earning assets less the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points in and decreased basis points in the decrease in was primarily attributable to the decline in the earning asset yield 
the company s net interest margin defined as taxable equivalent interest income less interest expense divided by average earning assets was in  compared to in and in in  the lower yields on earning assets partially offset by lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities resulted in the basis point decline in the margin 
loan growth is anticipated to have a favorable impact on net interest income during the upcoming year along with any favorable changes in the federal reserve s target rate on overnight funds 
however  depending on the magnitude of the loan growth  the improvement attributable to growth may be partially or completely offset by unfavorable repricing variances associated with deposits 
a further discussion of the company s earning assets and funding sources can be found in the section entitled financial condition 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease in the provision reflects continued strong credit quality and lower inherent risk in the loan portfolio due to the sale of the credit card portfolio  which previously accounted for approximately one third of net charge offs 
net charge offs for were comparable to  and remain at historically low levels relative to the size of the portfolio 
net charge offs for totaled million  or 
of average loans 
this compares to million  or 
for excluding credit card charge offs  net charge offs increased  due to a higher level of commercial loan and consumer indirect auto loan charge offs 
at december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million compared to million in at year end  the allowance represented of total loans and provided coverage of of nonperforming loans 
management considers the allowance to be adequate based on the current level of nonperforming loans and the estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio at year end 
see the section entitled financial condition and tables and for further information regarding the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income in  noninterest income increased million  or  compared to an increase of million  or in the increase in the level of noninterest income is attributable primarily to a one time million gain recognized from the sale of the credit card portfolio 
higher deposit service fees  asset management fees  data processing fees  and merchant service fees also contributed to the increase  but were partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking revenues 
excluding the one time gain on the sale of the credit card portfolio  noninterest income represented of operating revenue in compared to in the increase in noninterest income in was attributable to growth in deposit service charge fees  merchant service fee income  and mortgage banking revenues 
factors affecting noninterest income are discussed below 
service charge fees on deposit accounts increased million  or  in  compared to an increase of million  or  in deposit service charge revenues in any one year are dependent on the number of accounts  primarily transaction accounts  the level of activity subject to service charges  and the collection rate 
the increase in service charge revenues in was primarily attributable to growth in nsf overdraft fees associated with a revised fee structure implemented in mid and implementation of improved processing efficiencies in late the increase in deposit service charge fees in was primarily attributable to growth in nsf overdraft fees associated with a new overdraft protection program implemented in late data processing revenues increased  or  in versus an increase of  or  in the data processing center provides computer services to both financial and non financial clients in north florida and south georgia 
the increase in was driven by an increase in revenues from financial clients 
the company currently provides data processing services for six financial clients and contract processing services for six non financial clients 
in  processing revenues for financial clients increased and represented of total processing revenues 
processing revenues for non financial clients decreased in due to slightly lower processing volume for one government client 
in  processing revenues for financial clients represented of total processing revenues 
the increase in processing revenues for was due to higher revenues from both financial clients and government contract processing 
in  asset management fees increased million  or  versus an increase of  or  in at year end  assets under management totaled million  reflecting growth of million  or over this growth is due to the purchase of million in trust and investment management accounts from synovus trust company in connection with the quincy state bank acquisition  growth in new business  and increased fee revenues from managed accounts due to improved asset returns 
at year end  assets under management totaled million  reflecting growth of million  or over the company continues to be among the leaders in the production of residential mortgage loans in many of its markets 
in  mortgage banking revenues decreased million  or  compared to an increase of  or in the decrease in was due to a decline in fixed rate mortgage production that was affected by a general slow down in residential lending markets 
the company generally sells all fixed rate residential loan production into the secondary market 
management expects mortgage banking revenues to remain near the levels experienced in the increase in revenue in was due to a high level of fixed rate mortgage production driven by a historically low interest rate environment 
the level of interest rates  origination volume and percent of fixed rate production have significant impacts on the company s mortgage banking revenues 
other noninterest income increased million  or  in versus an increase of million  or in the increase in was attributable primarily to an increase in merchant service fee income  retail brokerage fees  and miscellaneous income 
merchant service fee income increased  or  due to increased transaction volume and was partially offset with higher interchange service fees  which is reflected in noninterest expense 
retail brokerage fees increased  or due to increased commission fees driven by higher trade volume and the number of accounts 
miscellaneous income increased  due primarily to one time gains realized from the sale of two parcels of other real estate 
the increase in noninterest income was attributable primarily to higher merchant service fees and miscellaneous recoveries 
noninterest income as a percent of average assets increased to in  compared to in  and in  driven primarily by the one time gain on sale of the credit card portfolio  higher deposit service charge fees  and asset management fees 
noninterest expense noninterest expense for was million  an increase of million  or  over  compared with an increase of million  or  in factors impacting the company s noninterest expense during and are discussed below 
the company s aggregate compensation expense in totaled million  an increase of million  or  over the increase is primarily attributable to higher associate salary expense  higher performance based compensation  increased pension costs  and higher healthcare insurance premiums 
the increase in associate salary expense reflects normal merit and market based increases  the integration of two acquired banks  and higher performance based compensation  which is primarily reflective of higher incentive payments to loan production associates 
the higher pension cost is a result of an increase in the number of plan participants  slightly lower than expected return on plan assets  and use of a slightly lower discount rate 
pension costs in are expected to be higher due to the increase in the number of plan participants associated with the two acquisitions during the year 
healthcare premiums are expected to continue to increase due to additional participants and rising costs from healthcare providers 
in  aggregate compensation increased  or  over the increase was primarily attributable to higher pension costs  healthcare insurance premiums  and stock based compensation  partially offset by higher deferred loan costs  which is accounted for as a reduction to associate salary expense 
occupancy expense including furniture  fixtures and equipment increased by million  or  in  compared to  or in the increase in was primarily due to higher expense for utilities  property taxes  depreciation  and premises rental attributable to the increase in banking offices 
the increase in was primarily due to higher furniture fixture  utility  and building depreciation expenses associated with the addition of four new banking offices 
other noninterest expense increased million  or  in  compared to  or  in the increase in was attributable primarily to higher professional fees of  higher director fees of  higher advertising expense of  increased interchange service fees of  higher contribution expense of  higher telephone expense of  higher intangible amortization expense of  and higher merger expenses of  the increase in professional fees is primarily reflective of the cost of sarbanes oxley section compliance and testing work 
the increase in director fees is reflective of an increase in the number of directors  higher fee structure  and number of committees and meetings 
higher advertising expense is due to an increased level of marketing initiatives aimed at supporting two new acquisitions during the year and an increased level of product and market support activities 
the increase in interchange service fees is reflective of increased merchant card processing volume  and was offset by higher merchant service fees reflected in other income 
the increase in contribution expense is due primarily to an increase in contributions made to local non profit scholarship funding organizations 
the increase in telephone  intangible amortization  and merger expenses were due to the integration of two acquisitions during the year 
the increase in was attributable to higher legal costs of  primarily resulting from corporate governance compliance work associated with the sarbanes oxley act  increased processing expenses of  associated with implementation of new database systems in human resources  and custom programming work performed by the bank s core processing system vendor to facilitate the implementation of new applications platform automation and home banking  and increased interchange service fees of  associated with higher merchant card processing volume 
these increases were partially offset with approximately  lower expense for legal reserves  and lower seminar education expense of  the net noninterest expense ratio defined as noninterest income minus noninterest expense  net of intangible amortization and conversion merger related expenses  as a percent of average assets was in compared to in  and in the company s efficiency ratio expressed as noninterest expense  net of intangible amortization and conversion merger related expenses  as a percent of taxable equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income was   and in  and  respectively 
excluding the affect of the one time gain realized from the sale of the credit card portfolio  the above mentioned metrics adjust to and and  respectively  for income taxes the consolidated provision for federal and state income taxes was million in  compared to million in  and million in the increase in each of the three respective years was due to higher taxable income and lower tax exempt income 
the effective tax rate was in  in  and in these rates differ from the combined federal and state statutory tax rates due primarily to tax exempt income 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in was due to an adjustment in federal income tax expense in the amount of  made during the fourth quarter of following an irs examination in  the company performed an evaluation of all its tax accounts 
upon completion of the analysis  the company adjusted certain tax accounts to more appropriately reflect its current and deferred assets and liabilities

average assets totaled billion  an increase of million  or  in versus the comparable period in average earning assets for were billion  representing an increase of million  or  over loan growth  in existing markets and from acquisitions  fueled the earning asset increase in as average loans increased million  or 
partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in average funds sold of million  or and a slight decline in investment securities of million  or

approximately million  or of the growth in average loans was from loan production in existing markets  and approximately million  or was from acquisitions 
although management is continually evaluating alternative sources of revenue  lending is a major component of the company s business and is key to profitability 
while management strives to identify opportunities to increase loans outstanding and enhance the portfolio s overall contribution to earnings  it can do so only by adhering to sound lending principles applied in a prudent and consistent manner 
thus  management will not relax its underwriting standards in order to achieve designated growth goals

allowance for loan losses management maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to provide for the estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
credit losses arise from the borrowers inability and unwillingness to repay  and from other risks inherent in the lending process including collateral risk  operations risk  concentration risk and economic risk 
as such  all related risks of lending are considered when assessing the adequacy of the loan loss reserve 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s judgment of overall loan quality 
this is a significant estimate based on a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio 
the balance can and will change based on changes in the assessment of the portfolio s overall credit quality 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed for adequacy of collateral  with a specific reserve assigned to those loans when necessary 
impaired loans are defined as those in which the full collection of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms is improbable 
impaired loans generally include those that are past due for days or more and those classified as doubtful in accordance with the company s risk rating system 
loans classified as doubtful have a high possibility of loss  but because of certain factors that may work to strengthen the loan  its classification as a loss is deferred until a more exact status may be determined 
not all loans are considered in the review for impairment  only loans that are for business purposes exceeding  are considered 
the evaluation is based on current financial condition of the borrower or current payment status of the loan 
the method used to assign a specific reserve depends on whether repayment of the loan is dependent on liquidation of collateral 
if repayment is dependent on the sale of collateral  the reserve is equivalent to the recorded investment in the loan less the fair value of the collateral after estimated sales expenses 
if repayment is not dependent on the sale of collateral  the reserve is equivalent to the recorded investment in the loan less the estimated cash flows discounted using the loan s effective interest rate 
the discounted value of the cash flows is based on the anticipated timing of the receipt of cash payments from the borrower 
the reserve allocations assigned to impaired loans are sensitive to the extent market conditions or the actual timing of cash receipts change 
once specific reserves have been assigned to impaired loans  general reserves are assigned to the remaining portfolio 
general reserves are assigned to commercial purpose loans exceeding  that are not impaired 
finally  general reserves are assigned to large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans  including commercial purpose loans less than  which are not deemed to be impaired  consumer loans  and residential mortgage loans 
large commercial purpose loans exhibiting specific weaknesses are detailed in a monthly problem loan report 
these loans are divided into seven different pools based on various risk characteristics and the underlying value of collateral taken to secure specific loans within the pools 
these classified loans are monitored for changes in risk ratings that are assigned based on the bank s asset classification policy  and for the ultimate disposition of the loan 
the ultimate disposition may include upgrades in risk ratings  payoff of the loan  or charge off of the loan 
this migration analysis results in a charge off ratio by loan pool of classified loans that is applied to the balance of the pool to determine general reserves for specifically identified pools of problem loans 
this charge off ratio is adjusted for various environmental factors including past due and nonperforming trends in the loan portfolio  the micro and macro economic outlook  and credit administration practices as determined by independent parties 
general reserves are assigned to large commercial purpose loans exceeding  that do not exhibit weaknesses and pools of smaller balance homogenous loans based on calculated overall charge off ratios over the past three years 
the charge off ratios applied are adjusted as detailed above  with further consideration given to the highest charge off experience of the bank dating back to the recession of the late s 
the allowance for loan losses is compared against the sum of the specific reserves assigned to problem loans plus the general reserves assigned to pools of loans that are not specific problem loans

while there can be no assurance that the company will not sustain loan losses in a particular period that are substantial in relation to the size of the allowance  management s assessment of the loan portfolio does not indicate a likelihood of this occurrence 
it is management s opinion that the allowance at december  is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio at year end 
table provides an allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan types for each of the past five years 
the reserve allocations  as calculated using the above methodology  are assigned to specific loan categories corresponding to the type represented within the components discussed 
the greatest losses experienced by the company have historically occurred in the consumer loan portfolio  including credit cards 
as such  the greatest amount of the allowance has been allocated to consumer loans despite its relatively small balance 
the credit card portfolio was sold in  thus the allowance amount allocated to consumer loans declined noticeably as of december  compared to december   the increase in reserve allocated to commercial real estate mortgage loans is reflective of the large increase in this category due to loans acquired from farmers and merchants bank of dublin 
management has implemented credit risk management procedures to closely monitor all segments of its loan portfolio  including the ongoing review of the delivery  underwriting and collection practices to reduce loan losses

table depicts certain categories of the company s risk element assets as of december for each of the last five years 
potential problem loans and loan concentrations are discussed within the narrative portion of this section 
the company s nonperforming loans increased million  or from a level of million at december   to million at december  the increase from is primarily reflective of one large commercial real estate loan added to nonaccrual status in the amount of million 
during loans totaling approximately million were added  while loans totaling million were removed from nonaccruing status 
of the million removed  million consisted of principal reductions and loan payoffs   represented loans transferred to other real estate  million consisted of loans brought current and returned to an accrual status  and  was charged off 
where appropriate  management has allocated specific reserves to absorb anticipated losses 
the majority of the company s net charge offs in were in the consumer portfolio where loans are charged off based on past due status and are not recorded as nonaccruing loans 
all nonaccrual loans exceeding  not secured by family residential properties are reviewed quarterly for impairment 
a loan is considered impaired when the full collection of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms is in doubt 
when a loan is considered impaired  it is reviewed for exposure to credit loss 
if credit loss is probable  a specific reserve is allocated to absorb the anticipated loss 
the company had million in loans considered impaired at december  the anticipated loss in those impaired loans is table risk element assets as of december  dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans      restructured total nonperforming loans      other real estate    total nonperforming assets      past due days or more    nonperforming loans loans 




nonperforming assets loans plus other real estate 




nonperforming assets capital allowance nonperforming loans for computation of this percentage  capital refers to shareowners equity plus the allowance for loan losses 
interest on nonaccrual loans is generally recognized only when received 
cash collected on nonaccrual loans is applied against the principal balance or recognized as interest income based upon management s expectations as to the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest in full 
if interest on nonaccruing loans had been recognized on a fully accruing basis  interest income recorded would have been  higher for the year ended december  other real estate totaled  at december   versus million at december  this category includes property owned by capital city bank that was acquired either through foreclosure procedures or by receiving a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
during  the company added properties totaling million  and partially or completely liquidated properties totaling million  resulting in a net decrease in other real estate of approximately million 
the majority of the decrease is due to the resolution of a large commercial real estate loan in the amount of million during the first quarter of potential problem loans are defined as those loans which are now current but where management has doubt as to the borrower s ability to comply with present loan repayment terms 
potential problem loans totaled million at december  loans past due days or more totaled  at year end  up from  at the previous year end 
this is primarily the result of the addition of several smaller consumer loans 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and such amount exceeds of total loans 
due to the lack of diversified industry within the markets served by the bank and the relatively close proximity of the markets  the company has both geographic concentrations as well as concentrations in the types of loans funded 
specifically  due to the nature of the company s markets  a significant portion of the portfolio has historically been secured with real estate 
while the company has a majority of its loans secured by real estate  the primary types of real estate collateral are commercial properties and family residential properties 
at december   commercial real estate mortgage loans and residential real estate mortgage loans accounted for and of the loan portfolio  respectively 
the real estate portfolio  while subject to cyclical pressures  is not typically speculative in nature and is originated at amounts that are within or below regulatory guidelines for collateral values 
management anticipates no significant reduction in the percentage of real estate loans to total loans outstanding 
management is continually analyzing its loan portfolio in an effort to identify and resolve its problem assets as quickly and efficiently as possible 
as of december   management believes it has identified and adequately reserved for such problem assets 
however  management recognizes that many factors can adversely impact various segments of its markets  creating financial difficulties for certain borrowers 
as such  management continues to focus its attention on promptly identifying and providing for potential losses as they arise 
investment securities in  the company s average investment portfolio decreased million  or  from and million  or  from to as a percentage of average earning assets  the investment portfolio represented in  compared to in in  the decline was due to maturities in the portfolio partially offset by the addition of million in investment securities obtained in the two acquisitions 
in  the decline in the portfolio was attributable to the maturities of investment securities in most categories  which in anticipation of future loan growth  were only partially replaced during the period 
throughout  the company will closely monitor liquidity levels to determine if the company should purchase additional investments 
in  average taxable investments increased million  or  primarily as a result of the acquisitions  while tax exempt investments decreased million  or 
although the tax reform act of significantly reduced the tax benefits associated with tax exempt securities  management will continue to purchase bank qualified municipal issues when it considers the yield to be attractive and the company can do so without adversely impacting its tax position 
as of december   the company may purchase additional tax exempt securities without adverse tax consequences 
the investment portfolio is a significant component of the company s operations and  as such  it functions as a key element of liquidity and asset liability management 
as of december   all securities are classified as available for sale 
classifying securities as available for sale offers management full flexibility in managing its liquidity and interest rate sensitivity without adversely impacting its regulatory capital levels 
securities in the available for sale portfolio are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities recorded  net of tax  in the accumulated other comprehensive loss income component of shareowners equity 
at december   shareowners equity included a net unrealized loss of million  compared to a gain of million at december  it is neither management s intent nor practice to participate in the trading of investment securities for the purpose of recognizing gains and therefore the company does not maintain a trading portfolio

the ratio of shareowners equity to total assets at year end was   and  in   and  respectively 
the company is subject to risk based capital guidelines that measure capital relative to risk weighted assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
capital guidelines issued by the federal reserve board require bank holding companies to have a minimum total risk based capital ratio of  with at least half of the total capital in the form of tier capital 
as of december   the company exceeded these capital guidelines with a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier ratio of  compared to and  respectively  in as allowed by federal reserve board capital guidelines the trust preferred securities issued by ccbg capital trust i are included as tier capital in the company s capital calculations previously noted

a tangible leverage ratio is also used in connection with the risk based capital standards and is defined as tier capital divided by average assets 
the minimum leverage ratio under this standard is for the highest rated bank holding companies which are not undertaking significant expansion programs 
an additional to may be required for other companies  depending upon their regulatory ratings and expansion plans

in   shares  valued at approximately  were issued under these plans 
dividends adequate capital and financial strength is paramount to the stability of the company and its subsidiary bank 
cash dividends declared and paid should not place unnecessary strain on the company s capital levels 
when determining the level of dividends the following factors are considered compliance with state and federal laws and regulations  the company s capital position and its ability to meet its financial obligations  projected earnings and asset levels  and the ability of the bank and ccbg to fund dividends 
although a consistent dividend payment is believed to be favorably viewed by the financial markets and shareowners  the board of directors will declare dividends only if the company is considered to have adequate capital 
future capital requirements and corporate plans are considered when the board considers a dividend payment

however  the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
at december   the company had million in commitments to extend credit and million in standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the company uses the same credit policies in establishing commitments and issuing letters of credit as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
if commitments arising from these financial instruments continue to require funding at historical levels  management does not anticipate that such funding will adversely impact its ability to meet on going obligations 
in the event these commitments require funding in excess of historical levels  management believes current liquidity  available lines of credit from the federal home loan bank  investment security maturities and the company s revolving credit facility provide a sufficient source of funds to meet these commitments 
accounting policies critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the company to make various estimates and assumptions see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses 
provisions are made to reserve for estimated losses in loan balances 
the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is evaluated quarterly by the company for adequacy 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce a different required allowance  and thereby a larger or smaller provision recognized as expense in any given reporting period 
a further discussion of the allowance for loan losses can be found in the section entitled allowance for loan losses and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill  core deposit assets  and other identifiable intangibles that were recognized in connection with various acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
the company performs an impairment review on an annual basis to determine if there has been impairment of its goodwill 
the company has determined that no impairment existed at december  impairment testing requires management to make significant judgments and estimates relating to the fair value of its identified reporting units 
significant changes to these estimates may have a material impact on the company s reported results 
core deposit assets represent the premium the company paid for core deposits 
core deposit intangibles are amortized on the straight line method over various periods ranging from years 
generally  core deposits refer to nonpublic  nonmaturing deposits including noninterest bearing deposits  now  money market and savings 
the company makes certain estimates relating to the useful life of these assets  and rate of run off based on the nature of the specific assets and the customer bases acquired 
if there is a reason to believe there has been a permanent loss in value  management will assess these assets for impairment 
any changes in the original estimates may materially affect reported earnings 
pension assumptions the company has a trusteed defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of substantially all associates of the company 
the company s funding policy with respect to the pension plan is to contribute amounts to the plan sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set by law 
pension expense  reflected in the consolidated statements of income in noninterest expense as salaries and associate benefits  is determined by an external actuarial valuation based on assumptions that are evaluated annually as of december  the measurement date for the pension obligation 
the consolidated statements of financial condition reflect an accrued pension benefit cost due to funding levels and unrecognized actuarial amounts 
the most significant assumptions used in calculating the pension obligation are the weighted average discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligation  the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and the assumed rate of annual compensation increases 
these assumptions are re evaluated annually with the external actuaries  taking into consideration both current market conditions and anticipated long term market conditions 
the weighted average discount rate is determined by matching anticipated retirement plan cash flows for a year period to long term corporate aa rated bonds and solving for the underlying rate of return  which investing in such securities would generate 
this methodology is applied consistently from year to year 
the discount rate utilized in was 
the estimated impact to pension expense of a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have been a decrease of approximately  and an increase of approximately  respectively 
the discount rate to be used in will be 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the current and anticipated future mix of assets in the plan

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment revised 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity i exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  or ii incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of the equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using apb and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement based on their fair values on the date of the grant 
the company adopted the accounting standards set forth in sfas no 
in and has accordingly expensed stock based compensation for and see note accounting policies 
in march  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force in issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
eitf provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss 
an investment is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
generally  an impairment is considered other than temporary unless a the investor has the ability and intent to hold an investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment  and b evidence indicating that the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
if impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss should be recognized equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
certain disclosure requirements of eitf were adopted in and the company began presenting the new disclosure requirement in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the recognition and impairment provisions were initially effective for other than temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning after june  however  in september  the effective date of these provisions was delayed until the finalization of the fasb staff position fsp to provide additional implementation guidance 
the company is continuing to evaluate the impact of eitf the amount of other than temporary impairment the company will recognize  if any  will be dependent on market conditions and management s intent and ability at the time of the evaluation to hold investments with unrealized losses until a forecasted recovery in the fair value up to and beyond the adjusted cost 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin revised december finr  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
finr replaces fin  which was issued in january finr applies immediately to a variable interest entity created after january  and as of the first interim period ending after march  to those variable interest entities created before february  and not already consolidated under fin in previously issued financial statements 
the company has adopted fin r in connection with its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the implementation of fin r requires the company to not consolidate its investment in ccbg capital trust i because the company is not the primary beneficiary 
in december  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop sop no 
 accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop addresses accounting for differences between the contractual cash flows of certain loans and debt securities and the cash flows expected to be collected when loans or debt securities are acquired in a transfer and those cash flow differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
as such  sop applies to loans and debt securities acquired individually  in pools or as part of a business combination and does not apply to originated loans 
the application of sop limits the interest income  including accretion of purchase price discounts  that may be recognized for certain loans and debt securities 
additionally  sop does not allow the excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected to be recognized as an adjustment of yield  loss accrual or valuation allowance  such as the allowance for loan losses 
sop requires that increases in expected cash flows subsequent to the initial investment be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield on the loan or debt security over its remaining life 
decreases in expected cash flows should be recognized as impairment 
in the case of loans acquired in a business combination where the loans show signs of credit deterioration  sop represents a significant change from current purchase accounting practice whereby the acquiree s allowance for loan losses is typically added to the acquirer s allowance for loan losses 
sop is effective for loans and debt securities acquired by the company beginning january  loans acquired in future acquisitions will be impacted by the adoption of this pronouncement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk overview market risk management arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk and does not participate in activities that give rise to significant market risk involving exchange rates  commodity prices  or equity prices 
in asset and liability management activities  policies are in place that are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk 
interest rate risk management the normal course of business activity exposes ccbg to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
the company seeks to avoid fluctuations in its net interest margin and to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates 
accordingly  the company s interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are monitored on an ongoing basis by its asset and liability committee alco  which oversees market risk management and establishes risk measures  limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effects on net interest income and capital 
a variety of measures are used to provide for a comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk  the distribution of risk  the level of risk over time and the exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
alco continuously monitors and manages the balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
alco s objective is to manage the impact of fluctuating market rates on net interest income within acceptable levels 
in order to meet this objective  management may adjust the rates charged paid on loans deposits or may shorten lengthen the duration of assets or liabilities within the parameters set by alco 
the financial assets and liabilities of the company are classified as other than trading 
an analysis of the other than trading financial components  including the fair values  are presented in table this table presents the company s consolidated interest rate sensitivity position as of year end based upon certain assumptions as set forth in the notes to the table 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity analysis is to measure the impact on the company s net interest income due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the asset and liability values presented in table may not necessarily be indicative of the company s interest rate sensitivity over an extended period of time 
the company expects rising rates to have a favorable impact on the net interest margin  subject to the magnitude and timeframe over which the rate changes occur 
however  as general interest rates rise or fall  other factors such as current market conditions and competition may impact how the company responds to changing rates and thus impact the magnitude of change in net interest income 
nonmaturity deposits offer management greater discretion as to the direction  timing  and magnitude of interest rate changes and can have a material impact on the company s interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the relative level of interest rates as compared to the current yields rates of existing assets liabilities can impact both the direction and magnitude of the change in net interest margin as rates rise and fall from one period to the next 
inflation the impact of inflation on the banking industry differs significantly from that of other industries in which a large portion of total resources are invested in fixed assets such as property  plant and equipment 
assets and liabilities of financial institutions are virtually all monetary in nature  and therefore are primarily impacted by interest rates rather than changing prices 
while the general level of inflation underlies most interest rates  interest rates react more to changes in the expected rate of inflation and to changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
net interest income and the interest rate spread are good measures of the company s ability to react to changing interest rates and are discussed in further detail in the section entitled results of operations
