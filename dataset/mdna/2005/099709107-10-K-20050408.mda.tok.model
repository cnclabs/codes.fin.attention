restatement of prior year financial statements in light of announcements made by a number of public companies regarding lease accounting and a recently issued sec clarification on the subject  the company has reevaluated its lease accounting practices 
as a result  the company has corrected its computation of straight line rent expense  depreciation of leasehold improvements and the classification of landlord allowances related to leasehold improvements the restatement 
since fiscal  the company has depreciated leasehold improvements relating to leased properties over the shorter of the assets estimated useful lives or the initial lease terms  excluding any renewal options 
this is consistent with the company s utilization of initial lease terms in its calculation of straight line rent expense  including periods prior to fiscal for borders stores opened in fiscal and earlier  however  the company depreciated leasehold improvements over a year period while the straight line rent expense in those same years was computed over the initial lease terms  which in some cases were less than years 
therefore  to ensure compliance with gaap  the company has corrected its calculation of its depreciation of leasehold improvements to utilize the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the initial terms of the related leases 

table of contents in addition  the company changed its classification of landlord allowances on the consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows 
historically  landlord allowances were classified on the company s consolidated balance sheets as reductions of property and equipment  and were classified as a reduction in capital expenditures  an investing activity  on the company s consolidated statements of cash flows 
in order to comply with the provisions of fasb technical bulletin no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases ftb  however  the company has classified landlord allowances primarily as deferred rent liabilities  in other long term liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets  and as an operating activity on the company s consolidated statements of cash flows 
also  the company had recognized the straight line rent expense for leases beginning on the commencement date of the lease  which had the effect of excluding the construction build out period of its stores from the calculation of the period over which it expenses rent 
the accounting for straight line rent expense has been corrected to include the construction build out period 
we did not amend our previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the restatement  and the financial statements and related financial information contained in such reports should no longer be relied upon

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates 
asset impairments the carrying value of long lived assets is evaluated whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in performing such reviews for recoverability  the company compares the expected cash flows to the carrying value of long lived assets for the applicable stores 
if the expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value 
expected future cash flows  which are estimated over each store s remaining lease term  contain estimates of sales and the impact those future sales will have upon cash flows 
future sales are estimated based  in part  upon a projection of each store s sales trend based on the actual sales of the past several years 
additionally  each store s future cash contribution is based upon the most recent year s actual cash contribution  but is adjusted based upon projected trends in sales and store operating costs 
fair value is estimated using expected discounted future cash flows  with the discount rate approximating the company s borrowing rate 
significant deterioration in the performance of the company s stores compared to projections could result in significant additional asset impairments 
goodwill impairment pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  the company s goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
pursuant to fas  a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment a component  for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management 
the company s reporting units were identified as the operating segments borders  waldenbooks and corporate  and the country components of the international operating segment 
the carrying amounts of the net assets of the applicable reporting units including goodwill are compared to the estimated fair values of those reporting units 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model which depends on  among other factors  estimates of future sales and expense trends  liquidity and capitalization 
the discount rate used approximates the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
changes in any of the assumptions underlying these estimates may result in the future impairment of goodwill 
as of january   no impairment of goodwill existed 
inventory the carrying value of the company s inventory is affected by reserves for shrinkage and non returnable inventory 
projections of shrinkage are based upon the results of regular  periodic physical counts of the company s inventory 
the company s shrinkage reserve is adjusted as warranted based upon the trends yielded by the physical counts 
reserves for non returnable inventory are based upon the company s history of liquidating non returnable inventory 
the markdown percentages utilized in developing the reserve are evaluated against actual  ongoing markdowns of non returnable inventory to ensure that they remain consistent 
significant differences between future experience and that which was projected for either the shrinkage or non returnable inventory reserves could affect the recorded amounts of inventory and cost of sales 
the company includes certain distribution and other expenses in its inventory costs  particularly freight  distribution payroll  and certain occupancy expenses 
in addition  certain selling  general and administrative expenses are included in inventory costs 
these amounts totaled approximately million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
the extent to which these costs are included in inventory is based on certain estimates of space and labor allocation 

table of contents leases all leases are reviewed for capital or operating classification at their inception under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases fas  as amended 
the company uses its incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification 
gift certificates the company sells gift certificates to its customers and records a liability for the face value of all certificates issued within the last months 
for certificates older than months  the company records a liability for a portion of the certificates face value based upon historical redemption trends 
to the extent that future redemption patterns differ from those historically experienced  significant variations in the recorded reserves may result 
advertising and vendor incentive programs the company receives payments and credits from vendors pursuant to co operative advertising programs  shared markdown programs  purchase volume incentive programs and magazine slotting programs 
these programs continue to be beneficial for both the company and vendors  and the company expects continued participation in these types of programs 
changes in vendor participation levels  as well as changes in the volume of merchandise purchased  among other factors  could adversely impact the company s results of operations and liquidity 
pursuant to co operative advertising programs offered by vendors  the company contracts with vendors to promote merchandise for specified time periods 
pursuant to the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  which the company adopted effective january   vendor consideration which represents a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs is included in the selling  general and administrative line on the consolidated statements of operations  along with the related costs  in the period the promotion takes place 
consideration which exceeds such costs is classified as a reduction of the cost of merchandise sold line on the consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  the company has recorded million and million of vendor consideration as a reduction to its inventory balance at january  and january   respectively 
the company also receives credits from vendors pursuant to shared markdown programs  purchase volume programs  and magazine slotting programs 
credits received pursuant to these programs are classified in the cost of merchandise sold line on the consolidated statements of operations  and are recognized upon certain product volume thresholds being met or product placements occurring 
income taxes the company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether  and to the extent which  additional taxes will be due 
the company also records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion of all of such net operating losses will not be realized 
the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings  changes in the expected outcome of audit controversies or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
new accounting guidance in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  which is a revision of fas fas r supersedes apb no 
 and amends fas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in fas r is similar to the approach described in fas however  fas r requires all share based 
table of contents payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
the company expects to adopt fas r in the third quarter of using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the adoption date based on a the requirements of fas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as of january   there were million stock option awards granted to employees that remain unvested 
the company currently recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
based on the adoption of fas r in the third quarter of  the company estimates the impact to not exceed an after tax charge of approximately million 
fas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in november  the fasb issued fas  inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter fas 
the amendments made by fas clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of fas is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
related party transactions the company has not engaged in any related party transactions which would have had a material effect on the company s financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to these risks is managed though a combination of normal operating and financing activities  which include the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
interest rate risk the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  as interest on certain of the company s borrowings is based on variable rates 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company is currently utilizing interest rate swaps to achieve this objective  effectively converting a portion of its variable rate exposure to fixed interest rates 
the company is also subject to risk associated with the fair value of its million of notes which are fixed rate debt 
to eliminate this risk  the company is currently utilizing an interest rate swap  effectively converting the notes fixed interest rate to a variable rate 
libor is the rate upon which the company s variable rate debt and its payments under the lease financing facilities are principally based 
if libor were to increase for the full year of as compared to  the company s after tax earnings  after considering the effects of its existing interest rate swap agreements  would decrease approximately million based on the company s expected average outstanding debt as of january  
table of contents foreign currency exchange risk the company is subject to foreign currency exchange exposure for operations with assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
on a normal basis  the company does not attempt to hedge the foreign currency translation fluctuations in the net investments in its foreign subsidiaries 
the company does  from time to time  enter into short term forward exchange contracts to sell or purchase foreign currencies at specified rates based on estimated foreign currency cash flows 
it is the policy of the company not to purchase financial and or derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
at january   the company had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding
