net income for  adjusted to remove the effects of this item  net of taxes  was  net interest income 
the primary component of the company s net income is its net interest income  which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund income producing assets 
net interest income is determined by the spread between the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities 
net interest income  divided by average interest earning assets  represents the company s net interest margin 
consolidated net interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the  increase for the most recent year was primarily due to a decrease in deposit expense and an increase in income on us government agency securities

off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and commitments off balance sheet arrangements 
the bank is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
loan commitments and lines of credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any conditions of the contracts 
loan commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts  fixed expiration dates  and may require payment of a fee 
lines of credit generally have variable interest rates 
many of the loan commitments and lines of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  accordingly  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral or other security obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation 
collateral held varies but may include deposits held in financial institutions  us treasury securities  other marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  personal residences  income producing commercial properties  and land under development 
personal guarantees are also obtained to provide added security for certain commitments 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to guarantee the installation of real property improvements and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the bank holds collateral and obtains personal guarantees supporting those commitments for which collateral or other securities is deemed necessary 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of the commitment 
loan commitments  lines of credit  and letters of credit are made on the same terms  including collateral  as outstanding loans 
as of december   the bank has accrued  for unfunded commitments related to these financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  which is included in other liabilities 
contractual obligations 
the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due in in thousands note reference one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years total deposits without a stated maturity a  c time deposits a short term borrowings a long term borrowings b operating leases a excludes interest b includes junior subordinated debentures and semi annual payments made in march and september of  this is also assuming that the debentures will be paid off in september c includes non interest bearing deposits 
commitments 
the following table details the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments as of december  further discussion of these commitments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due in in thousands one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years total loan commitments other mortgage loans unused lines of credit home equity lines commercial lines unsecured consumer lines letters of credit market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates or equity pricing 
the company s principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from its lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
the company s profitability is dependent on the bank s net interest income 
interest rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different intervals than interest earning assets 
the bank s asset liability and risk management committee oversees the management of interest rate risk 
the primary purpose of the committee is to manage the exposure of net interest margins to unexpected changes due to interest rate fluctuations 
the company does not utilize derivative financial or commodity instruments or hedging strategies in its management of interest rate risk 
the primary tool used by the committee to monitor interest rate risk is a gap report which measures the dollar difference between the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing within a given time period 
these efforts affect the loan pricing and deposit rate policies of the company as well as the asset mix  volume guidelines  and liquidity and capital planning 
the following table sets forth the bank s interest rate sensitivity at december  months over to months over through years over years total dollars in thousands assets cash and due from banks federal funds and overnight deposits securities loans fixed assets other assets total assets liabilities demand deposit accounts now accounts money market deposit accounts savings accounts ira accounts certificates of deposit other liabilities junior subordinated debenture stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity gap cumulative gap cumulative gap as a of total assets the foregoing analysis assumes that the bank s assets and liabilities move with rates at their earliest repricing opportunities based on final maturity 
mortgage backed securities are assumed to mature during the period in which they are estimated to prepay and it is assumed that loans and other securities are not called prior to maturity 
certificates of deposit and ira accounts are presumed to reprice at maturity 
now savings accounts are assumed to reprice at within three months although it is the company s experience that such accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates 
in addition to gap analysis  the bank utilizes a simulation model to quantify the effect a hypothetical immediate plus or minus basis point change in rates would have on net interest income and the economic value of equity 
the model takes into consideration the effect of call features of investments as well as prepayments of loans in periods of declining rates 
when actual changes in interest rates occur  the changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may differ from the assumptions used in the model 
as of december   the model produced the following sensitivity profile for net interest income and the economic value of equity 
immediate change in rates basis points basis points basis points basis points change in net interest income change in economic value of equity liquidity and capital resources the company currently has no business other than that of the bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the bank 
the bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the bank s principal sources of funds for investments and operations are net income  deposits from its primary market area  principal and interest payments on loans  interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities 
its principal funding commitments are for the origination or purchase of loans and the payment of maturing deposits 
deposits are considered the primary source of funds supporting the bank s lending and investment activities 
the bank also uses borrowings from the fhlb of atlanta to supplement deposits  residential and small business lending  and to meet specific and anticipated needs 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which are cash on hand  amounts due from financial institutions  federal funds sold and money market mutual funds 
the levels of such assets are dependent on the bank s operating financing and investment activities at any given time 
the variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows 
cash and cash equivalents cash due from banks  interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  and federal funds sold  as of december   totaled  a decrease of  or  from the december  total of  most of this decrease was due to a decrease in the vault cash held at the branches and a decrease in deposits held at two other institutions 
as of december   the bank was permitted to draw on a million line of credit from the fhlb of atlanta 
borrowings under the line are secured by a floating lien on the bank s residential mortgage loans and its portfolio of us government and agency securities 
as of december   a million long term convertible advance was outstanding under this line 
in addition the bank has a secured line of credit in the amount of million from another commercial bank on which it has not drawn 
furthermore  on september   the company issued  of its junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures to glen burnie statutory trust i  a connecticut statutory trust wholly owned by the company 
the trust  in turn  issued  of its capital securities to institutional investors 
the debentures are scheduled to mature on september   unless called by the company not earlier than september  as of december   the full  was outstanding 
federal banking regulations require the company and the bank to maintain specified levels of capital 
at december   the company was in compliance with these requirements with a leverage ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and total risk based capital ratio of 
at december   the bank met the criteria for designation as a well capitalized depository institution under fdic regulations 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in mature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  starting on page f and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as discussed there  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
management has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities based on historical experience and on various assumptions which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the company reevaluates these variables as facts and circumstances change 
historically  actual results have not differed significantly from the company s estimates 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental accounting estimates and principles involved in the preparation of the company s financial statements  including the identification of the variables most important in the estimation process allowance for credit losses 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur  including historical losses as an indicator of future losses  fair market value of collateral  and various general or industry or geographic specific economic events 
the use of these estimates and values is inherently subjective and the actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
for further information regarding our allowance for credit losses  see allowance for credit losses under item business of this annual report 
accrued taxes 
management estimates income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities 
income taxes are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the company s tax position 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretations no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which provides guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and results of operations of a vie are to be included in an entity s consolidated financial statements 
a vie exists when either the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities by itself  or the equity investors lack one of three characteristics associated with owning a controlling financial interest 
those characteristics include the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity if they occur  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
during the third quarter of  the company applied the provisions of fin to a wholly owned subsidiary trust that issued capital securities to third party investors 
the application of fin resulted in the deconsolidation of a wholly owned subsidiary trust 
see note for further discussion of this trust and the company s related obligations 
in december  the fasb reissued fin with certain modifications and clarifications 
application of this guidance was effective for interests in certain vies commonly referred to as special purpose entities spes as of december  application for all other types of entities is required for periods ending after march   unless previously applied 
management continues to evaluate the applicability of fin management does not believe that the application of fin will have an impact on financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
the federal reserve board is currently evaluating the impact on tier capital 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities under sfas  as well as amends certain other existing fasb pronouncements 
in general  sfas is effective for derivative transactions entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on financial condition  the results of operations  or liquidity  as the company and bank does not have derivative or hedging instruments 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the provisions of sfas became effective june   for all financial instruments created or modified after may   and otherwise became effective as of july  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on financial condition  the results of operations  or liquidity 
in december  the fasb deferred for an indefinite period the application of the guidance in sfas to noncontrolling interests that are classified as equity in the financial statements of a subsidiary but would be classified as a liability in the parent s financial statements under sfas the deferral is limited to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests associated with finite lived subsidiaries 
management does not believe any such applicable entities exist as of december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 share based payment revised 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity i exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  or ii incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of the equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using apb and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement based on their fair values on the date of the grant 
sfas r is effective for the company on january  the company will transition to fair value based accounting for stock based compensation using a modified version of prospective application modified prospective application 
under modified prospective application  as it is applicable to the company  sfas r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after january  additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered generally referring to non vested awards that are outstanding as of january  must be recognized as the remaining requisite service is rendered during the period of and or the periods after the adoption of sfas r 
the attribution of compensation cost for those earlier awards will be based on the same method and on the same grant date fair values previously determined for the pro forma disclosures required for companies that did not adopt the fair value accounting method for stock based employee compensation 
the company expects to recognize additional pre tax  quarterly compensation costs beginning in the first quarter of as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
future levels of compensation cost recognized related to stock based compensation awards including the aforementioned expected costs during the period of adoption may be impacted by new awards and or modifications  repurchases and cancellations of existing awards before and after the adoption of this standard 
in november  the fasb also issued emerging issues task force issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this statement establishes standards for accounting for and disclosure of declines in fair value below cost basis of available for sale and held to maturity investment securities
