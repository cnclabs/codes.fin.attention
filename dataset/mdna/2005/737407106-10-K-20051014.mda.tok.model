item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we develop  manufacture  and market medical devices for mechanical thrombectomy in native coronary arteries and coronary bypass grafts  leg arteries and in kidney dialysis access grafts 
our primary product  the angiojet rheolytic thrombectomy system angiojet system uses miniaturized waterjet technology  which enables interventional cardiologists  interventional radiologists  vascular surgeons  and other specialists to remove blood clots throughout the body 
the proprietary angiojet system consists of a drive unit capital equipment  a disposable pump set that delivers pressurized saline to a catheter  and a variety of disposable catheters that are specifically designed for particular clinical indications 
the angiojet coronary catheter is a class iii medical device and is marketed in the us under an approved pma 
the angiojet av access and peripheral arterial catheters are class ii devices and are marketed in the us under cleared k submissions 
we expect us angiojet system sales to grow primarily through obtaining additional fda approved product uses  introduction of new catheter models for existing indications  introduction of angiojet system related products  more face time selling to existing accounts  peer to peer selling  and the publication of clinical performance and cost effectiveness data 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include accounts of possis medical  inc and all wholly owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and applied our best judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
our most critical accounting policies are those described below 
application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenues associated with angiojet drive units that are maintained at customer locations are recognized  and title and risk of loss on those drive units is transferred to the customer when we receive a valid purchase order from the customer 
revenue is not recognized for angiojet drive units that are maintained at customer locations as evaluation drive units 
we do not lease angiojet drive units 
revenues associated with products that are shipped to customers from our facilities are recognized  and title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer  when a valid purchase order is received and the products are received at the customer s location 
provisions for returns are recorded in the same period the related revenues are recognized 
revenue recognition for drive unit extended warranties is amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the warranty period that is generally twelve months 
allowance for returns trade receivable  are reduced by an allowance for items that may be returned in the future 
the allowance requires us to make estimates at the time the account receivable is recorded concerning the likelihood of returns 
the estimate is based upon our historical product return experience  customer complaint rates  information received from our customers and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we review  on a quarterly basis  the actual returns for the previous quarter and evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for future returns 
although we believe the amount of the allowance for returns is appropriate  actual returns incurred could differ from our original estimate  requiring adjustments to the allowance 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our trade receivables are due from health care facilities located in the united states 
the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the age of the outstanding receivables and the payment history and creditworthiness of each customer 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
although we believe the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate  nonpayment of accounts could differ from our original estimate  requiring adjustments to the allowance 
inventories we value inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in order to determine the market value of inventory  on a quarterly basis  we assess the inventory quantities on hand to estimate future usage and sales and  if necessary  set up an obsolescence reserve for inventory deemed excess or obsolete to estimate market value 
although we believe the amount of the reserve for inventory obsolescence is appropriate  the amount of our inventory that becomes obsolete may differ from our original estimate  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
warranty reserve we provide a one year limited warranty on our angiojet system drive unit and a limited warranty on angiojet system disposable products 
we establish a warranty reserve at the time products are sold that is based upon historical frequency of claims relating to our products and the cost to replace disposable products and to repair drive units under warranty 
we evaluate the adequacy of the warranty reserve on a quarterly basis 
although we believe the amount of the warranty reserve is appropriate  given our historical experience  if actual claims incurred differ from the original estimate  we would be required to adjust the reserve 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we became profitable starting in the third quarter of fiscal and have remained profitable since that time 
we increased our deferred tax asset by an additional  in fiscal  an additional  in fiscal and an additional  in fiscal these increases were related to tax benefits from disqualified stock options that are recorded directly in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity 
due to the previous three full years operating results projected forward through the carry forward period  we reduced our valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the remaining valuation allowance of  of the deferred tax asset relate to the research and development tax credits and may not be realizable 
in our selected financial data  management s discussion and analysis  and notes to consolidated financial statements  the company makes reference to a non gaap general accepted accounting principles financial measure income per common share before income taxes 
the company believes that this non gaap financial measure is useful to investors because it provides investors with another measure to consider  in conjunction with the gaap results that may be helpful to meaningfully compare the company s operating performance 
it is especially useful for fiscal and  when the company had an unusual tax benefit due to the reduction of the tax valuation allowance 
in each case that the company makes reference to a non gaap financial measure  the company also provides a reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measures 
results of operations fiscal years ended july   and summary total product sales for fiscal decreased  or to  compared to  in fiscal total product sales for increased  or  to  compared to  in fiscal we recorded net income of  or per diluted share  in fiscal  compared to net income of  or per diluted share  in fiscal and net income of  or per diluted share  in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a benefit for income taxes in the amount of  due to the reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and changes in temporary differences 
this income tax benefit offset our income tax provision of  and resulted in a net income tax benefit of  the reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of  increased net income per share by per diluted share

our revenue increased during fiscal because of us marketing of the angiojet system for additional applications and because of the expansion of our direct sales force 
as of july   we had a total of  domestic angiojet system drive units in the field  compared to  and  at the end of the previous two fiscal years 
during fiscal  we sold approximately  catheters and pump sets versus approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal this represents an decrease in fiscal and a increase in fiscal in unit catheter sales from the previous years 
during the fiscal years ended july   and  we sold angiojet system drive units in fiscal  drive units in fiscal and drive units in fiscal the increasing angiojet system drive unit sales resulted from drive unit promotions with several of our group purchasing organizations in fiscal and  continuing customer acceptance of our expanded and improved coronary and peripheral catheter product lines and the expansion of our sales force  but was offset  in  by the negative effects of the aimi study 
we employ a variety of flexible drive unit sale programs  including outright sale and various evaluation programs 
the purchasing cycle for the angiojet system drive unit varies depending on the customer s budget cycle and is normally approximately six months from the beginning of the marketing cycle 
we have signed contracts with eight purchasing groups to accelerate orders and increase market penetration 
these purchasing groups evaluate and screen new medical technologies  and negotiate pre determined discounts on behalf of their members  and 
by working with these purchasing groups  we are placed on their recommended vendor list  and in some instances receive marketing support from the purchasing group supported by a marketing fee that we pay 
these discounts and marketing fees have been offset by the increase in our sales to the member hospitals of the purchasing group 
there has been no material negative effect on our margins due to these discounts and marketing fees 
the discounts reduce gross revenue on the income statement  while marketing fees are included in selling  general and administrative expense on the income statement 
foreign sales of the angiojet system were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in sales is primarily due to the introduction of the xmi rx  xmi and xvg catheters and the increase in drive unit sales in the european market 
in addition  we hired an outside consultant to expand product penetration in germany in fiscal limited foreign sales are primarily due to cost constraints in overseas markets 
cost of medical products cost of medical products decreased  to  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in angiojet system product unit sales offset by higher production overhead on lower units produced combined with an increase in overhead costs 
cost of medical products increased  to  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the growth in the us angiojet system product sales 
gross profit decreased by  to  or of product sales  in fiscal from  or of product sales in fiscal  but increased  in fiscal from  or of product sales in fiscal the decrease in the gross profit margin in fiscal was primarily due to lower revenue and to a shift to products carrying a lower gross profit margin 
the improvement in gross profit margin in fiscal was driven by higher volumes of xmi rx  xmi  xvg and xpeedior plus catheters that carry higher margins than the catheters they replaced 
we believe that gross margins as a percent of sales will be in the lower to mid seventies for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense increased  to  or of product sales  in fiscal compared to  or of product sales in fiscal the primary factors for the expense increase fiscal were the additional expenses associated with the growth in the sales force  increased employee medical benefit costs  increase in sarbanes oxley related professional fees  increase in executive benefit plan expense  increase in depreciation  increase in software expense  and an increase in building rent and operating 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in expenses associated with marketing clinical trials  a reduction of incentives  a decrease in sales materials and sales demos  a decrease in outside services and a decrease in contract labor 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  to  or of product sales  in fiscal from  or of product sales in fiscal the primary factors for the expense increase for fiscal were increased sales and marketing expenses related to the expansion of the company s us direct sales organization for the angiojet system  increased overall compensation  contract labor and fringe benefits  increased marketing fees for the national purchasing contracts  increased sales demos and sales materials  increased professional fees and outside services and an increase in patent expense 
these expenses were partially offset by a reduction in patient enrollment associated with marketing clinical trials and software and computer depreciation 
we expect that the current us sales force will be sufficient to grow sales and service our current customer base for the angiojet system through fiscal research and development expenses research and development expenses increased  to  or of product sales  in fiscal compared to  or of product sales in fiscal the increase was largely due to the timing of expenses incurred for various research and development projects including the new drive unit  an associated project to combine the pump and catheter  dvx peripheral catheter  and projects relating to the improvement of the rapid exchange catheter and the distal occlusion guidewires 
research and development expenses increased  to  or of product sales  in fiscal compared to  or of product sales in fiscal the increase was largely due to the timing of expenses incurred for various research and development projects including the new drive unit  an associated project to combine the pump and catheter  and projects relating to the improvement of the rapid exchange catheter  the distal occlusion guidewires and the power pulse spray projects 
we believe that research and development expenses for angiojet system applications and related products will decrease in fiscal over fiscal levels 
research and development expense levels are dependent upon the continuing development of its current products and investment in the development of new angiojet system thrombectomy applications and related products including clinical trials 
interest income interest income increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  and increased  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increases are due to the investing of excess cash and cash equivalents in an enhanced cash management portfolio of marketable securities and to the recent interest rate increases 
the company expects interest income to increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to positive operating cash flows and an expected interest rate increase 
loss gain on sale of securities loss on sales of securities was  in fiscal and  in 
gain on sales of securities was  in fiscal the losses in fiscal and were due to interest rate increases that reduced the fair market value of the investments in marketable securities 
future gain loss on sale of securities is dependent on interest rate fluctuations 
provision benefit for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of  or approximately of income before income taxes  for fiscal the company recorded a provision for income taxes of  or approximately of income before income taxes  for fiscal in fiscal the company recorded a benefit for income taxes of  the benefit for income taxes in fiscal was due to the reversal of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset 
during fiscal we determined that the scope of our operations caused us to have nexus in states in which it had not previously filed corporate state income tax returns 
we filed the appropriate corporate state income tax returns in these states  including returns for prior years  to obtain the appropriate net operating loss carry forwards 
we expensed an additional  of corporate state income tax expense relating to the filing of these state corporate income tax returns during fiscal we became profitable starting in the third quarter of fiscal and have maintained profitability since 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  and due to the uncertainty of realizing the value of our deferred tax asset  we had established a valuation allowance equal to percent of the value of the tax asset  reducing the amount of such asset reflected on our balance sheet to zero 
in the fourth quarters of fiscal and  we reassessed the likelihood that the deferred tax asset would be recovered from future taxable income 
due to the previous three full years operating results projected forward  the company reduced its valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by  and  during the fourth quarter of fiscal and  respectively 
these reductions in the allowance resulted in a tax benefit  which was partially offset by changes in temporary differences 
we increased our deferred tax asset by an additional  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal  as a result of the tax benefit from exercise of disqualified stock options that are recorded directly in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity 
the remaining valuation allowance of  of the deferred tax asset relate to the research and development tax credits and may not be realizable 
effects of inflation inflation and changes in prices  had very little effect on our net revenue and net income from operations for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately  at july  compared to  at july  the primary factor in the decrease was cash used in financing activities to repurchase company stock 
during fiscal  we generated  of cash from operating activities  which resulted primarily from  net income  depreciation of  a decrease in deferred tax assets of  stock compensation expense of  and a decrease in accounts receivable of  these sources of cash from operations were partially offset by cash used to fund an increase in inventories of  an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  depreciation includes company owned drive units at customer locations  as well as property and equipment 
the decrease in the deferred tax asset was due to the utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards to offset current taxes payable 
the  decrease in receivables was due to decrease in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal inventory increased as we built additional units to meet the anticipated increase in demand of the angiojet system that was not realized because of the negative impact of the aimi post marketing study results 
the decrease in trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to the timing of the payments 
we used  of cash in investing activities during fiscal this includes the net purchase of marketable securities of  and the purchase of  of property and equipment 
we used  of cash in financing activities in fiscal  which resulted from the repurchase of  shares of our common stock for  offset partially by the cash received in connection with the exercise of stock options for  during fiscal  we generated  of cash from operating activities  which resulted primarily from  net income  depreciation of  a decrease in deferred tax assets of  non cash stock compensation expense of  an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  these cash sources were partially offset by cash used in operations to fund an increase in receivables of  an increase in inventories of  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of  the increase in trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to the timing of the payments  including an increase in accrued compensation which was paid subsequent to year end 
the  increase in receivables was due to increase in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal inventory increased due to the increase in demand for the angiojet system

net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal  consisting of  of cash received upon exercise of stock options and warrants  offset by  used to repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
except with respect to lease obligations and purchase obligations  we do not have any substantial commitments for capital expenditures 
the following table sets forth contractual obligations at july  payments due by period less than total year years years thereafter operating lease obligations      purchase obligations   other long term liabilities     total      with over million of cash and marketable securities  we believe our cash on hand and funds from operations will be sufficient to cover both our short term and long term operating requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any debt or off balance sheet financial arrangements 
outlook we expect that overall revenue from the angiojet system  primarily in the united states  will be in the range of million to million in fiscal we expect that gross margin for fiscal will be in the low to mid seventies as a percent of total sales 
the company expects selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal due to anticipated growth in revenue 
the company believes that research and development expense for angiojet system applications and related products will decrease in fiscal over fiscal levels 
research and development expense levels are dependent upon the continuing development of its current products and investment in the development of new angiojet system thrombectomy applications and related products  including clinical trials 
including the impact of stock based compensation expense  the company anticipates net income per diluted share of to for fiscal the impact of expensing stock based compensation per fas no 
r is anticipated to be approximately per diluted share for the first quarter and per diluted share for fiscal year fas no 
r requires all companies to measure compensation expense for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value and recognize the expense over the related service period 
in addition  the company expects that increasing working capital investments in trade receivables and inventory will be required to support projected growing product sales 
the company expects to repurchase its common stock from time to time in open market transactions when it deems appropriate
