based in rockville  maryland  matrics was a leader in developing electronic product code epc compliant rfid systems 
rfid is a next generation data capture technology that utilizes small tags attached to products or assets that emit radio signals that can be read at a distance 
this allows for remote reading device of information relevant to the asset  similar to that contained in bar codes 
because rfid does not require physical contact between the reader and the tag  or even a line of sight  it provides the ability to capture more data more efficiently and is beneficial in areas such as supply chain management  asset tracking and security 
matrics has focused its strategic rfid solutions efforts on electronic product code standards  which are the emerging global rfid standards 
matrics has developed epc compliant rfid systems for retail  defense  transportation and other vertical markets 
the matrics product portfolio features rfid systems including multi protocol  epc compliant fixed readers  readers designed for embedded applications  such as rfid printers and mobile computers  high performance antennas for rfid tag reading  and epc labels that can be attached to items such as containers  pallets  cartons and more 
the rfid tag family includes both read only and read write functionality that addresses a wide range of asset visibility applications 
matrics is also developing a proprietary manufacturing process that is expected to provide for higher volume and more cost effective manufacturing of tags 
we believe the acquisition of matrics is an important step in executing our plan to be a leader in rfid  and will expand our offerings in the advanced data capture industry 
prior to the acquisition of matrics  we had been internally developing a handheld rfid reader and a services and support business focused on the deployment of rfid systems 
our revenues from our internal rfid business were insignificant 
the matrics acquisition has allowed us to offer complete rfid systems by adding commercially ready fixed rfid reader systems and tag products to our current offerings 
we believe rfid technology is a new generation of advanced data capture and is complementary to our offering of bar code scanners and rugged handheld computers 
the acquisition of matrics had a million negative impact on our year ended december  net earnings and a negative impact on earnings per share  primarily as a result of a million write off of in process research and development costs  the interest expense and amortization of fees associated with the short term credit facility used to fund the acquisition and the refinancing thereof with the new credit facility on december  we paid a significant premium for matrics  and thus allocated a significant portion of the purchase price to goodwill  because we believe that epc based technology will be a material area of investment for our customers in our retail  manufacturing  transportation and logistics  wholesale distribution  healthcare and government vertical markets 
we believe that matrics is an early market leader with its commercial tag and reader products based on its trial deployments and full implementations with its customers in retail  transportation  healthcare  and government vertical markets 
the rfid market is at the early stages of development 
however we currently believe that the costs we will incur during the product life cycle for both existing technology and future  replacement  rfid technology will be consistent with the expenditures we have incurred in developing and maintaining our existing enterprise mobility solutions 
our goal is to obtain a significant share of the market by combining our expertise in sales and support for enterprise mobility solutions 
table of contents along with our engineering resources and matrics expertise in this emerging market  which is a market that is projected to grow rapidly in the next three to five years 
if we are unable to develop or enhance the matrics technology within the timeframe outlined  we may not meet our revenue and profitability projections 
furthermore  we believe that a number of our existing customers intend to deploy rfid systems utilizing technology such as that provided by matrics and if we fail to deliver those products  those customers may be less willing to purchase our other existing products  further negatively impacting revenue and profitability 
if we do not develop or enhance the matrics technology in line with our projections  we may be required to incur higher than expected operating and capital expenses in order to address these issues and meet projections 
new credit facility on december   we entered into our new credit facility i to repay in full our outstanding senior indebtedness  comprised of the short term credit facility and our prior revolving credit facility  dated as of november   ii for working capital and general corporate purposes  and iii to pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with such transactions 
pursuant to our new credit facility  the lenders severally agreed to provide us the following a a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of million and b a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to million with a million sublimit available for letters of credit 
our new credit facility is secured on a first priority basis by i a pledge of all of the capital stock or other equity interests of our domestic subsidiaries  ii a pledge of of the capital stock or other equity interests of selected overseas subsidiaries located in the united kingdom  the netherlands and japan  iii of the capital stock of the manufacturing entity in reynosa  mexico and all of its other assets and iv all our other domestic assets other than real estate and the stock of our domestic subsidiaries

we have contractual relationships and strategic alliances with unaffiliated resellers and distributors 
through these relationships  we are able to broaden our distribution network and participate in industries other than those serviced by our direct sales force and distributors 
for example  in we entered into a strategic alliance with at t wireless  through which at t wireless and symbol will jointly sell and market at t wireless voice and data services for some of our mobile computing products in order to provide customers with real time enterprise mobility 
in  we agreed to jointly develop and co market with nextel communications  inc nextel voice and data mobility solutions to help business customers reduce operating costs  increase workforce productivity and drive operational efficiencies 
the symbol nextel mobile solutions for vertical field service and sales workers will be targeted across many industry segments  including transportation and distribution  public safety  retail  manufacturing  healthcare  utilities and telecommunications 
in  we increased our focus on our reseller channel strategy and initiated our partnerselect tm program  which is designed to enhance the capabilities of our resellers and distributors and our relationships with them

we have been recognized by varbusiness magazine as one of north america s top information technology vendors for the breadth and depth of our channel reseller and distributor program offerings 

table of contents we believe our focus on reseller channel strategy and the partnerselect tm program will allow us to leverage our sg a cost structure over time without materially impacting our gross margins 
with respect to sg a  we believe we are able to benefit from our channel leveraged cost structure for distribution 
the benefits to our cost structure of leveraging our channel for distribution are related to two areas 
first  our channel reduces the amount of overhead we require to sell and distribute our products by acting as an aggregation point 
second  the distribution channel allows us to reduce fluctuations in our selling prices by pricing products into the channel at a consistent rate and allowing the distribution channel to absorb any price changes in our sales to the end user customer 
this allows for more reliable gross margin performance which as a result allows symbol to focus on cost reduction and efficiency in its supply chain and distribution processes 
we also believe our channel sales force allows us to increase revenues by extending our supply to meet demand in market segments to which our direct sales force does not sell 
resellers and distributors each have their own sales organizations which in many cases complement symbol s sales organization in their coverage of potential customers of our products 
additionally  resellers and distributors often pursue sales that have lower total revenue potential  and thus might not be covered by our direct sales force 
finally  in many cases resellers have deep expertise with specific applications or a specific customer s operations that allow them to be effective in selling symbol s products 
as a result  we believe our distribution model helps us meet our goal of maintaining our gross margin over time  as we obtain scale from shipping more efficiently through better management of our supply chain

product manufacturing our products are principally manufactured at our reynosa  mexico facility 
we also have a facility in bohemia  new york that we utilize as a new product development center 
while components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources  we currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for several components  certain subassemblies and products 
in the past  unexpected demand for communication products caused worldwide shortages of certain electronic parts and allocation of such parts by suppliers that had an adverse impact on our ability to deliver our products as well as on the cost of producing such products 
while we have entered into contracts with suppliers of parts that we anticipate may be in short supply  there can be no assurance that additional parts will not become the subject of such shortages or that such suppliers will be able to deliver the parts in fulfillment of their contracts 
due to the general availability of components and supplies  we do not believe that the loss of any supplier or subassembly manufacturer would have a long term material adverse effect on our business although set up costs and delays could occur in the short term if we change any single source supplier 
certain of our products are manufactured by third parties  most of which are outside the united states 
in particular  we have a long term strategic relationship with olympus optical  inc of japan olympus pursuant to which olympus and symbol jointly develop selected products that are manufactured by olympus exclusively for sale by us in the field of our business and prospective businesses 
we are currently selling several such products 
we have the right to manufacture such products if olympus is unable or unwilling to do so  but the loss of olympus as a manufacturer could have  at least  a temporary material adverse impact on our ability to deliver such products to our customers 
the percentage of our product sales that include products or that contain components manufactured by olympus historically has ranged from approximately to in any given quarterly period 
we have estimated that the temporary adverse impact if we lost olympus as a manufacturer would be approximately of the product sales that include products or that contain components manufactured by olympus or a temporary adverse impact of approximately to of total product sales 
we employ certain advanced manufacturing processes that require highly sophisticated and costly equipment and are continuously being modified in an effort to improve efficiency  reduce manufacturing costs and incorporate product improvements 
we generally maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand for products on short notice  as well as to meet anticipated sales levels 
this includes carrying reasonable amounts of inventory at our distributors in order to meet customer delivery requirements in a manner consistent with industry standards 
if our product mix changes in unanticipated ways  or if sales for particular products do not materialize as anticipated  we may have excess inventory or inventory that becomes obsolete 
in such cases  our operating results could be negatively affected 
research and product development we believe that our future growth depends  in large part  upon our ability to continue to apply our technology and intellectual property to develop new products  improve existing products and expand market applications for our products 
our research and development projects include  among other things  improve 
table of contents ments to the reliability  quality and capability of our laser scanners to read at increased working distances and at faster speeds and to decode higher density codes including  but not limited to  two dimensional codes  continued development of our solid state laser diode based scanners  development of solid state imager based engines for bar code data capture and general purpose imaging applications  development of rfid engines for data capture applications  improvements to packaging and miniaturization technology for bar code data capture products  mobile data collection devices and integrated bar code and rfid data capture products  development of high performance digital data radios  high speed  secure  manageable mobile data communications systems and telecommunications protocols and products  the development of smart mobile devices that may be located by intelligent wireless lan systems  and the addition of software to provide a complete line of high performance interface hardware 
we use both our own associates and from time to time unaffiliated consultants in our product engineering and research and development programs 
from time to time we have participated in and or partially funded research projects in conjunction with a number of universities including the state university of new york at stony brook  polytechnic university of new york and massachusetts institute of technology 
we also jointly develop technology with olympus  as described above 
we expended including overhead charges approximately million  million and million for research and development during the years ended december   and  respectively

competition the business in which we are engaged is highly competitive and acutely influenced by advances in technology  industry standards  product improvements and new product introduction and price competition 
many firms are engaged in the manufacture and marketing of products in bar code reading equipment  wireless networks and mobile computing devices and mobility software 
numerous companies  including present manufacturers of scanners  lasers  optical instruments  microprocessors  wireless networks  notebook computers  handheld devices and telephonic and other communication devices have the technical potential to compete with us 
many of these firms have far greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we do 
we compete principally on the basis of performance and the quality of our products and services 
we believe that our principal competitors are casio  inc  cisco systems  inc  datalogic spa  fujitsu  ltd  hand held products  inc  hewlett packard company  intermec technologies corporation  lxe inc  matsushita electric industrial co  ltd  metrologic instruments  inc  motorola  inc  ncr corporation  denso corporation  opticon  inc  proxim  inc  psc  inc 
and psion teklogix  inc 
dependence on a group of customers we are not dependent on any single customer  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
however  there are sales to one of our distribution partners that is greater than of our annual sales who in turn resell our products 
in addition  none of our segments is dependent on any single customer or a few customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on any of our segments 
seasonality we do not believe that sales in either of our segments is seasonal  however  within our product segment  certain product divisions may experience sales seasonality 
payment terms we offer industry standard payment terms and generally do not grant extended payment terms 
patent and trademark matters we file domestic and foreign patent applications to support our technology position and new product development 
our intellectual property includes more than us patents and more than international 
table of contents patents 
we have also filed additional patent applications in the us patent and trademark office as well as in foreign patent offices 
we will continue to file patent applications  both united states and foreign  to cover our most recent research developments in the scanning  information collection and network communications fields 
one of our basic patents covering handheld laser scanning technology expired on june   and a key companion patent expired june  due to the recent expiration of these patents  we may see increased competition in handheld trigger combined bar code readers  however  we have not witnessed any evidence of that to date 
notwithstanding the expiring patents  we believe that our extensive patent portfolio will continue to provide us with some level of competitive advantage 
additionally  an important scanner integrated computer patent will expire in  which could lead to increased competition in the marketplace 
although we believe that our patents provide a competitive advantage  we believe we are not dependent upon a single patent  or a few patents  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success depends more upon our proprietary know how  innovative skills  technical competence and marketing abilities 
in addition  because of rapidly changing technology  our present intention is not to rely primarily on patents or other intellectual property rights to protect or establish our market position 
however  symbol has in the past instituted litigation against competitors to enforce its intellectual property rights and is currently involved in several such lawsuits 
symbol has licensed some of its intellectual property rights through royalty bearing license agreements 
we may continue to enter into these types of arrangements and other types of arrangements should the circumstances lead us to believe that such an arrangement would be beneficial 
we have received and have currently pending third party claims and in the future may receive additional notices of such claims of infringement of other parties rights 
in such event  we have and will continue to take reasonable steps to evaluate the merits of such claims and take such action as we may deem appropriate  which action may require that we enter into licensing discussions  if available  and or modify the affected products and technology  or result in litigation against parties seeking to enforce a claim which we reasonably believe is without merit 
we have been involved in such litigation in the past  are currently involved in such litigation and additional litigation may be filed in the future 
such parties have and are likely to claim damages and or seek to enjoin commercial activities relating to our products or technology affected by such parties rights 
in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages  such litigation may require us to obtain a license in order to manufacture or market the affected products and technology 
to date  such activities have not had a material adverse affect on our business and we have either prevailed in all litigation  obtained a license on commercially acceptable terms or otherwise been able to modify any affected products or technology 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any such patent would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
a failure to obtain such licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest  and we believe that there has been and is likely to continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
for a description of certain of our intellectual property litigation  see item legal proceedings pending patent and trademark litigation 
we have also obtained certain domestic and international trademark registrations for our products and maintain certain details about our processes  products and strategies as trade secrets 
we regard our software as proprietary and attempt to protect it with copyrights  trade secret law and international nondisclosure safeguards  as well as restrictions on disclosure and transferability that are incorporated into our software license agreements 
we license our software products to customers rather than transferring title 
despite these restrictions  it may be possible for competitors or users to copy aspects of our products or to obtain information that we regard as trade secrets 
our computer software generally has not been patented and existing copyright laws afford only limited practical protection 
in addition  the laws of foreign countries generally do not protect our proprietary rights in our products to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 

table of contents government regulations the use of lasers and radio emissions are subject to regulation in the united states and in other countries in which we do business 
in the united states  various federal agencies including the center for devices and radiological health of the food and drug administration  the federal communications commission fcc  the occupational safety and health administration and various state agencies have promulgated regulations which concern the use of lasers and or radio electromagnetic emissions standards 
member countries of the european community have enacted standards concerning electrical and laser safety and electromagnetic compatibility and emissions standards 
regulatory changes in the united states and other countries may require modifications to some of our products in order for us to continue to be able to manufacture and market these products 
for example  certain consumer advocacy groups are lobbying against the adoption of rfid systems in the retail environment because of privacy and other consumer protection concerns 
while we believe that these concerns are mostly unfounded  there can be no assurance that such efforts will not result in regulatory and or legal action that could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and market rfid products 
our rf mobile computing product line includes various models  all of which intentionally transmit radio signals as part of their normal operation 
certain versions of our handheld computers and our spectrum one and spectrum networks utilize spread spectrum radio technology 
we have obtained certification from the fcc and other countries certification agencies for our products that utilize this radio technology 
users of these products in the united states do not require any license from the fcc to use or operate these products 
some of our products transmit narrow band radio signals as part of their normal operation 
we have obtained certification from the fcc and other countries certification agencies for our narrow band radio products 
users of these products in the united states do not require any license from the fcc to use or operate these products 
we also market radio products that utilize cellular radio technology 
we have obtained certification from the fcc and other countries certification agencies for our products that utilize this radio technology 
users of these products in the united states do not require any license from the fcc to use or operate these products 
in all cases  such certification is valid for the life of the product unless the circuitry of the product is altered in any material respect  in which case a new certification may be required 
where a country certificate has a limited duration  additional certification will be obtained during the life of the product  when required 
in addition  some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal  state  local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground  air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
certain of our products are subject to various federal  state  local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products 
in january  the european union eu issued two directives relating to chemical substances in electronic products 
the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive requires producers of electrical goods to pay for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of past and future covered products 
eu governments were required to enact and implement legislation that complies with this directive by august  such legislation together with the directive  the weee legislation  and certain producers are to be financially responsible under the weee legislation beginning in august the eu has issued another directive that requires electrical and electronic equipment placed on the eu market after july  to be free of lead  mercury  cadmium  hexavalent chromium above a threshold limit and brominated flame retardants 
eu governments were required to enact and implement legislation that complies with this directive by august  such legislation together with this directive  the rohs legislation 
based upon current information available to us  we believe we will be able to comply with these regulations within the applicable time periods 
however  if we do not comply with these directives  we may suffer a loss of revenue  be unable to sell in certain markets and or countries  be subject to penalties and enforced fees and or suffer a competitive disadvantage 
similar legislation could be enacted in other jurisdictions  including in the united states 
costs to comply with the weee legislation  rohs legislation and or similar future legislation  if 
table of contents applicable  could include costs associated with modifying our products  recycling and other waste processing costs  legal and regulatory costs and insurance costs 
we may also be required to take reserves for costs associated with compliance with these regulations 
employees at march   we had approximately  full time employees 
of these  approximately  were employed in the united states 
symbol also employs temporary production personnel 
none of our us employees is represented by a labor union 
some of our employees outside of the united states are represented by labor unions 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 
market and industry data in this section of the report  we rely on and refer to information and statistics regarding the industries and the sectors in which we compete 
we obtained this information and these statistics from various third party sources 
we believe that these sources and the estimates contained therein are reliable  but have not independently verified them 
such information involves risks and uncertainties and is subject to change based on various factors  including those discussed under the caption risk factors beginning on page of this report 

table of contents risk factors set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on symbol s business  results of operations and financial condition and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by symbol or our management 
risks relating to the investigations we recently settled separate investigations by the sec and the eastern district relating to the accounting misconduct of our prior management 
a violation of these settlement agreements could result in further prosecution by the sec and the eastern district 
on june   we announced that the sec and the eastern district concluded separate investigations relating to certain of our prior accounting practices and the prior administration of certain of our stock option plans 
these investigations arose in response to an inquiry from the sec in as a result of the sec inquiry  we conducted an initial internal investigation  with the assistance of a law firm  in may relating to such accounting practices 
we subsequently discovered that this investigation was hindered by certain of our former employees 
as a result of the actions by these former employees  the sec expressed dissatisfaction with the investigation 
in march  we undertook a second internal investigation that lasted approximately months  with the assistance of a different law firm and an independent forensic accounting team 
the results of that internal investigation gave rise to the restatement of our financial statements that affected our selected data for   and  our financial statements for the years ended december  and and our unaudited selected quarterly information for each of the four quarters in and the first three quarters of we have resolved the investigations by the sec and the eastern district and have entered into an injunction in connection with our june settlement with the sec and a non prosecution agreement with the eastern district 
as previously described  we have engaged outside counsel to assist with the investigation of the events leading to the discrepancies discovered at our company owned distribution facility in november and in responding to requests made by the eastern district and the sec regarding this matter  including whether symbol has complied with the injunction entered into in connection with its june settlement with the sec and non prosecution agreement with the eastern district 
there can be no assurance that these events will not give rise to an enforcement action or other proceeding brought by the eastern district or the sec 
if we are found to have violated the injunction entered into in connection with our june settlement with the sec or the non prosecution agreement with the eastern district or if we commit other violations  such as accounting offenses that were not the subject of the investigations  we have waived defenses that may have otherwise been available to us  including the statute of limitations  and will be subject to prosecution for any offense  including any offense that was the subject of the non prosecution agreement 
this could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  the agreements with the sec and the eastern district required us to pay million in cash to a restitution fund for members of a class consisting of purchasers of our stock from february  to october  and million to the united states postal inspection service consumer fraud fund 
we paid both amounts prior to june  for a discussion of the sec and the eastern district investigations  please see item 
legal proceedings 
pending litigation relating to the accounting misconduct of our prior management could generate negative publicity for us 
this could result in a decline in our stock price and cause you to lose part of your investment 
in march and june and february  robert asti  our former vice president north america sales and service finance  robert korkuc  our former chief accounting officer and brian burke  a former senior vice president of worldwide operations and a former chief accounting officer  respectively  pled guilty to two counts of securities fraud in connection with the government investigations described above 
the sec has filed civil complaints against messrs 
asti  korkuc and burke based upon similar facts 
since june  the eastern district has announced that four additional former employees  including leonard 
table of contents goldner  our former executive vice president and general counsel  have pled guilty to various conspiracy charges 
in addition  symbol  certain members of our former senior management team and certain former members of our board of directors were named defendants in two derivative actions  one alleging violations of federal securities laws and other claims similar to the class actions  and the second relating to the distribution of proxy statements by former directors 
on july   the court approved a settlement in which symbol would be realigned as plaintiff in the first derivative action  re positioning us to proceed against tomo razmilovic  one of our former presidents  chief executive officers and directors  and other members of our former management and certain former members of our board of directors 
in september  the court approved a settlement in which symbol would be realigned as the plaintiff in the second derivative suit related to the proxy statements 
the guilty pleas of the seven individuals mentioned above  the resolution of these civil complaints with the sec  the continued prosecution by the eastern district of tomo razmilovic and five other members of our former management  or the sec s filing of complaints against eleven members of our former management for securities fraud and other violations of the federal securities laws could generate negative publicity for us and result in a decline in our stock price 
our indemnification of our former management obligates us to indemnify and advance legal expenses to them  including with respect to the pending criminal and civil litigation for accounting misconduct  in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  other applicable agreements and delaware law 
our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our liabilities related to such litigation and the settlement of the securities fraud class action lawsuits 
to the extent our insurance coverage is insufficient to cover our liabilities  we may incur a material expense to satisfy such obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we may be obligated to indemnify and advance legal expenses to our former directors  officers or employees in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  other applicable agreements and delaware law 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for the indemnification of our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted under delaware law 
under delaware law  we may generally indemnify directors  officers and other employees against expenses including attorneys fees  judgments  fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with specified actions  suits and proceedings  whether civil  criminal  administrative or investigative other than in derivative actions  if they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and  with respect to any criminal action or proceeding  had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful 
although our former directors and officers may seek coverage under our current insurance policy  we have settled with our insurers who have reimbursed us in the amount of million and therefore  our insurance coverage for them may not be sufficient in some or all of these matters 
furthermore  the underwriters of our directors and officers insurance policy may seek to rescind or otherwise deny coverage in some or all of these matters 
for a discussion of the sec and eastern district investigations and related class action and derivative litigation  see item legal proceedings 
we do not expect our insurance coverage to cover our total liabilities and related litigation costs in the actions discussed above  including with respect to the securities fraud class action lawsuits  and the total liabilities and costs are still uncertain 
we have currently accrued approximately million related to the settlement of the class action lawsuits 
the plaintiffs have yet to specify the amount of damages being sought in the civil actions against our former management and our former board of directors  and  therefore  we are unable to estimate what our ultimate liability under our indemnification obligations in such lawsuits may be 
our indemnification obligations discussed above may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents senior management has been required to devote a significant amount of time on matters arising from actions of our prior management 
if senior management is unable to devote a significant amount of time in the future toward developing and executing our strategic business initiatives and managing ongoing business operations  we may not be able to remain competitive and our revenues may decline 
our senior management team has devoted a significant amount of time conducting internal investigations  restating our financial statements  reviewing and improving our internal controls and procedures  developing effective corporate governance procedures and responding to government inquiries and the related class action lawsuits arising form the actions of our prior management 
if senior management is unable to devote a significant amount of time in the future toward developing and executing our strategic business initiatives and managing ongoing business operations  we may not be able to remain competitive and our revenues may decline 
in addition  much of our middle management is new and may require a substantial amount of time building customer relationships and learning about and familiarizing themselves with symbol s products  operations and business culture 
a failure to implement effectively and efficiently our plan to remediate deficiencies in our internal controls and procedures could result in accounting errors and in violations of our settlement agreement with the sec and our non prosecution agreement with the eastern district 
as previously reported in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   we reported that a material weakness existed related to the manner in which we processed transactions to record revenue 
additionally  we reported that deficiencies existed relating to the adequacy and timeliness of account reconciliations  formalized worldwide policies and procedures  the amount of manual journal entries required to record transactions and the updating of documents with customers 
we also reported that for the fiscal year ended december   we had other material weaknesses that have since been remediated 
for information on the material weaknesses and deficiencies reported for the fiscal years ended december  and  see item change in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 
in addition  in november  during our inventory testing including a planned physical inventory at a company owned distribution center  two unrelated errors were discovered 
these errors were the result of two discrete events 
one event involved inaccurate inventory levels reported to us by a large distribution partner 
the under reported inventory levels resulted in us inaccurately reporting million in revenues in our earnings release on october  for the three and nine month period ended september  no previous periods were affected 
this was an oversight on the part of the distribution partner  which made us aware of the reporting error as soon as it was discovered 
the second discrepancy was the result of errors that occurred at a company owned distribution facility that serves one of our large retail customers 
the distribution center relies on its own internal reporting system and misreported inventory 
as a result of this second discrepancy  we over reported revenue by million for the three and nine month periods ended september  in our earnings release on october  based on these findings  management believed there were significant deficiencies relating to its controls for receiving  shipping and ultimately reporting the amount of inventory 
we are investigating the events leading to the discrepancies discovered at our company owned distribution facility 
we have engaged outside counsel to assist with the investigation and in responding to requests made by the eastern district and the sec regarding this matter  including whether symbol has complied with the injunction entered into in connection with its june settlement with the sec and non prosecution agreement with the eastern district 
there can be no assurance that these events will not give rise to an enforcement action or other proceeding brought by the eastern district or the sec 
the errors reported as described above led to the delay  but timely  filing of our quarterly report on form q as of and for the three and nine month periods ended september  in and continuing in as disclosed in certain of our periodic filings  we have implemented and continue to implement various initiatives to address the material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal controls as identified by our prior auditors and our own internal investigations  conducted with the oversight of 
table of contents our audit committee 
in response to the errors discussed in november  we have taken appropriate steps to ensure the financial results are fairly presented in all material respects we believe these initiatives  along with the initiatives related to our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  address our control environment  organization and staffing  policies  procedures  documentation and information systems and are intended to continuously improve our internal controls and procedures  address systems and personnel issues and help ensure a corporate culture that emphasizes integrity  honesty and accurate financial reporting 
the implementation of these initiatives is one of our highest priorities 
our board of directors  in coordination with our audit committee  continually assesses the progress and sufficiency of our initiatives related to our internal controls and make adjustments as necessary 
a failure of our internal controls and procedures could result in mistakes in our reported results and in violations of the injunction entered into in connection with our june settlement with the sec and our non prosecution agreement with the eastern district and could have a material adverse effect on our business  revenues or financial condition 
we have experienced material weaknesses in our internal controls 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to provide timely and accurate financial statements 
this could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial results and have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities 
during the past two years  we have identified a number of material weaknesses and reportable conditions in our internal financial controls 
some of these weaknesses resulted in errors in our historical financial statements  which in turn resulted in a restatement of our financial statements that affected our selected data for   and  our financial statements for the years ended december  and and our unaudited selected quarterly information for each of the four quarters in and the first three quarters of although we have taken significant steps to correct the internal control deficiencies that resulted in the restatement of our financial statements  during our inventory testing conducted in connection with the reporting of our financial results for the three and nine month periods ended september   we identified significant deficiencies relating to the controls for receiving  shipping and ultimately reporting the amount of our inventory 
we have taken and continue to take steps to correct previously identified internal control deficiencies 
we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify further material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date 
beginning with the year ending december   pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  our management is required to deliver a report as part of the annual report on form k that assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  such report is set forth in item a 
controls and procedures of this annual report 
additionally  we are required to file with the sec an attestation report of our auditors on our management s assessment of and operating effectiveness of internal controls  which is included on page f of this annual report 
if a material weakness were identified with respect to our internal control over financial reporting  we would not be able to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective  which could result in the inability of our external auditors to deliver an unqualified report  or any report  on our internal controls 
inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effective on the trading price of our securities 

table of contents risks related to our business we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products 
if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and our customers changing needs or if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing costs over time as anticipated  we may not be able to remain competitive 
we are active in the research and development of new products and technologies and enhancing our current products 
however  research and development in the enterprise mobility industry is complex and filled with uncertainty 
if we expend a significant amount of resources and our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction of new or improved products  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and market share 
in addition  it is common for research and development projects to encounter delays due to unforeseen problems  resulting in low initial volume production  fewer product features than originally considered desirable and higher production costs than initially budgeted  which may result in lost market opportunities 
in addition  new products may not be commercially well received 
there could be a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and market share due to such delays or deficiencies in the development  manufacturing and delivery of new products 
we have made significant investments to develop enterprise mobility products because we believe enterprise mobility is a new and developing market in the information technology industry 
one example of our investments is our acquisition of matrics  a leader in developing epc compliant rfid systems 
if the rfid market or other markets in which we are investing do not grow  retailers and consumers do not react enthusiastically to enterprise mobility  we are unable to sell our enterprise mobility products and services at projected rates or the market adopts a standard for rfid technology that is different than that offered by matrics  then there could be a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our efforts in enterprise mobility are also dependent  in part  on applications developed and infrastructure deployed by third parties 
if third parties do not develop robust  new or innovative applications or create the appropriate infrastructure for enterprise mobility products and offer them to us or our customers on commercially reasonable terms  then there could be a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
once a product is in the marketplace  its selling price usually decreases over the life of the product  especially after a new competitive product is publicly announced  because customers often delay purchases of existing products until the new or improved versions of those products are available 
to lessen the effect of price decreases  our research and development teams attempt to reduce manufacturing costs of existing products in order to maintain or improve our margins on such products 
however  if cost reductions do not occur in a timely manner  there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results and market share 
a court has rendered a judgment against us in the amount of million  which  if upheld on appeal  would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
on september   a jury awarded approximately million in damages against our wholly owned subsidiary  telxon corporation telxon  for claims relating to an alleged contract between telxon and smart media of delaware  inc smi 
this sum included an award of approximately million to an individual 
telxon made certain post verdict motions seeking  among other things  a judgment in its favor notwithstanding the verdict  a new trial or a reduction in the amount of the jury verdicts 
the court denied all of these motions 
the court also rejected telxon s motion for a stay of entry of the judgment  and on may   the court entered judgment against telxon for approximately million in damages  plus statutory interest from the date of the verdicts 
the court also granted the individual s motion to add symbol as an additional counterclaim defendant 
while smi withdrew its motion to add symbol as a counterclaim defendant  there can be no assurance that symbol will not ultimately be held liable for the full amount of the jury verdicts  plus statutory interest from the date of the verdicts 
symbol and telxon have filed notices of appeal of these rulings and the related verdicts 
symbol and telxon have deposited approximately million into an interest bearing court escrow account to stay the execution of the judgment against both symbol and telxon pending resolution of the appeal 
symbol and telxon have filed their opening briefs on appeal 
smi 
table of contents and the individual filed their respective briefs on january  and symbol and telxon are due to respond on or before march  our available cash  including cash available under our existing lines of credit  may not be sufficient to pay jury verdicts of this size  and we may need to obtain additional financing in order to pay the judgment entered against telxon in this matter 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
in the event that such a judgment remained unpaid  we would be in violation of the terms of our new credit facility 
in addition  we currently have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements with respect to the jury verdicts and judgment entered as we believe that  in accordance with the relevant guidance set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  an unfavorable outcome of this litigation is not probable at this time 
nevertheless  while we are still vigorously defending against this lawsuit  we may ultimately be liable for the full amount of the judgment  plus statutory interest from the date of the verdicts  the payment of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
for more information on this litigation and the new credit facility  see item legal proceedings smart media litigation and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations existing indebtedness 
our business  operating results and growth rates may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions  as well as the volatile geopolitical environment 
our current business and operating plan assumes that economic activity in general  and information technology it spending in particular  will at least remain at current levels  however  we cannot be assured of the level of it spending  the deterioration of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and growth rates 
our business is especially affected by the economic success of the retail sector  which accounts for a significant portion of our business  and our results of operations may be adversely affected if the global economic and market conditions in the retail sector do not improve 
for the year ended december   direct sales to the retail sector accounted for approximately of our revenue 
in addition  our reseller customers sell our products to the retail sector  which may represent a substantial portion of our reseller customers sales 
if historically low interest rates rise  consumer demand could be further dampened and related retail it spending may be reduced 
we have made strategic acquisitions and entered into alliances and joint ventures in the past and intend to do so in the future 
if we are unable to find suitable acquisitions or partners or to achieve expected benefits from such acquisitions or partnerships  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  growth rates and results of operations 
as part of our ongoing business strategy to expand product offerings and acquire new technology  we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding  and enter into agreements relating to  possible acquisitions  strategic alliances and joint ventures 
if we are unable to identify future acquisition opportunities or reach agreement with such third parties  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  growth rates and results of operations 
even if we are able to complete acquisitions or enter into alliances and joint ventures that we believe will be successful  such transactions  especially those involving technology companies like matrics  are inherently risky 
significant risks to these transactions  including the acquisition of matrics  include the following integration and restructuring costs  both one time and ongoing  maintaining sufficient controls  policies and procedures  diversion of management s attention from ongoing business operations  establishing new informational  operational and financial systems to meet the needs of our business  losing key employees  
table of contents failing to achieve anticipated synergies  including with respect to complementary products  and unanticipated and unknown liabilities 
the acquisition of matrics had an immediate dilutive effect on our earnings per share 
in addition  the acquisition of matrics may not produce the revenue  earnings  business synergies or technological advances that we anticipate 
this could have an adverse effect on our competitive position  revenues and prospects for growth 
the acquisition of matrics had a million negative impact on our net earnings and a negative impact on earnings per share  primarily as a result of a million write off of in process research and development costs  interest expense and amortization of fees associated with the short term credit facility used to fund the acquisition and the refinancing thereof with the new credit facility on december  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the rfid market may not perform as expected for a variety of reasons  including the failure in the development and acceptance of epc compliant rfid systems  higher than expected implementation costs associated with rfid and the unreliability of unproven technology 
in addition  a competitor of symbol commenced a patent infringement lawsuit against matrics  which has since been merged with and into symbol 
any one or a combination of these factors may cause our revenue or earnings to be further negatively impacted 
we allocated approximately million of the total million purchase price of the matrics acquisition to goodwill 
the goodwill arose as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired of matrics 
we perform annual evaluations for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
if the financial performance of our businesses were to decline significantly  we could incur a non cash charge to our income statement for the impairment of goodwill 
we paid a significant premium for matrics because we believe that epc based technology will be a material area of investment for our customers in our retail  manufacturing  transportation and logistics  wholesale distribution  healthcare and government vertical markets 
we believe that matrics is an early market leader with its commercial tag and reader products based on its trial deployments and full implementations with its customers in retail  transportation  healthcare  and government vertical markets 
our goal is to obtain a significant share of the market by combining our expertise in sales and support for enterprise mobility solutions along with our engineering resources and the expertise of matrics in this emerging market  which is a market that is projected to grow rapidly in the next three to five years 
the rfid market is at the early stages of development 
however we currently believe that the costs we will incur during the product life cycle for both existing technology and future  replacement  rfid technology will be consistent with the expenditures we have incurred in developing and maintaining our existing enterprise mobility solutions 
if we are unable to develop or enhance the matrics technology within the timeframe expected  we may not meet our revenue and profitability projections 
furthermore  we believe that a number of our existing customers intend to deploy rfid systems utilizing technology such as that provided by matrics and if we fail to deliver those products  those customers may be less willing to purchase our other existing products  further negatively impacting revenue and profitability 
if we do not develop or enhance the matrics technology in line with our projections  we may be required to incur higher operating and capital expenses than expected in order to address these issues and meet projections 
the enterprise mobility industry is highly competitive  and competitive pressures from existing and new companies may have a material adverse effect on our business  revenues  growth rates and market share 
the enterprise mobility industry is a highly competitive industry that is influenced by the following advances in technology  new product introductions  
table of contents evolving industry standards  product improvements  rapidly changing customer needs  intellectual property invention and protection  marketing and distribution capabilities  competition from highly capitalized companies  entrance of new competitors  ability of customers to invest in information technology  and price competition 
if we do not keep pace with product and technology advances  there could be a material adverse effect on our competitive position  revenues and prospects for growth 
there is also likely to be continued pricing pressure as competitors attempt to maintain or increase market share 
the products manufactured and marketed by us and our competitors in the enterprise mobility industry are becoming more complex 
as the technological and functional capabilities of future products increase  these products may begin to compete with products being offered by traditional computer  network and communications industry participants that have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and manufacturing resources than we do 
we may not be able to compete successfully against these new competitors  and competitive pressures may result in a material adverse effect on our business or operating results 
we are subject to risks related to our operations outside the united states 
unpredictable foreign sales and manufacturing environments may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and revenues 
a substantial portion of our revenue has been generated from sales outside the united states 
for the year ended december   non us sales accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we also manufacture most of our products outside the united states  and we anticipate that an increasing percentage of new products and subassemblies will be manufactured outside the united states 
overall margins for our products have increased throughout and  partially as a result of increased efficiencies due to the transfer of internal manufacturing to our reynosa  mexico facility and external manufacturing to lower cost producers in china  taiwan and singapore 
these sales and manufacturing activities are subject to the risks of foreign operations  including the following increased security requirements  political uncertainties  transportation delays and interruptions  the impact of recessionary or inflationary foreign economies  adapting to different regulatory requirements  and different technology standards or customer expectations 
many of these risks have affected our business in the past and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and revenues 
we cannot predict whether the united states or any other country will impose new quotas  tariffs  taxes or other trade barriers upon the importation of our products or supplies  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our sales and manufacturing activities in foreign countries may be subject to lengthy receivables collection periods 
a significant increase in our uncollected receivables may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 
economic conditions in foreign countries where obligors under our receivables reside may affect our ability to collect our receivables 
such economic conditions include  but are not limited to unemployment  interest rates  exchange rates  inflation rates  and consumer perceptions of the economy 
if a large number of our obligors located in a foreign country experience any of the above mentioned conditions  or other conditions  or if we otherwise experience a significant increase in the length of our receivables collection periods or the amount of our uncollected receivables  we may experience a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 
at december   our percentage of non us receivables was approximately 
in addition  at december   our percentage of doubtful accounts for customers outside the us was approximately of our total allowance for doubtful accounts 
we may face trade barriers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and result in a loss of customers or suppliers 
trade barriers erected by the united states or other countries may interfere with our ability to offer our products and services in those markets 
we cannot predict whether the united states or any other country will impose new quotas  tariffs  taxes or other trade barriers upon the importation or exportation of our products or supplies  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
competition and trade barriers in those countries could require us to reduce prices  increase spending on marketing or product development  withdraw from or not enter certain markets or otherwise take actions adverse to us 
in all jurisdictions in which we operate  we are also subject to the laws and regulations that govern foreign investment and foreign trade  which may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the united states 
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar and other foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  including our sales and margins 
most of our equipment sales in western europe and asia are billed in foreign currencies and are subject to currency exchange fluctuations 
in prior years  changes in the value of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies have had an impact on our sales and margins 
we have a formal policy that permits the use of financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that may arise in the normal course of our business 
this policy prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  we cannot predict the direction or magnitude of future currency fluctuations 
a weakening of the currencies in which we generate sales relative to the currencies in which our costs are denominated may lower our results of operations and impair our financial condition 
for example  we purchase a large number of parts  components and third party products from japan 
the value of the yen in relation to the us dollar strengthened during and and has continued to appreciate throughout if the value of the yen continues to strengthen relative to the dollar  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
during and  the principal transactions hedged 
table of contents were short term intercompany sales 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions 
in all jurisdictions in which we operate  we are subject to the laws and regulations that govern currency exchange transactions  which may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 
we rely on our manufacturing facility in reynosa  mexico to manufacture a significant portion of our products 
any problems at the reynosa facility could have a material adverse effect on our business  costs of revenue and financial condition 
for the year ended december   approximately of our product cost of revenue can be attributed to our facility in reynosa  and we estimate that such percentage will be similar or higher for approximately of the products manufactured in this facility represent scanners and approximately represent mobile computer products 
in the past  we have experienced manufacturing problems in the ordinary course of business  such as equipment breakdowns and short term employee shortages  that have caused delivery delays 
while these past delays have not been material  we may experience material production difficulties and product delivery delays in the future as a result of the following changing process technologies  ramping production  installing new equipment at our manufacturing facilities  ability to hire and retain skilled employees  and shortage of key components 
if manufacturing problems in our reynosa facility were to arise or if use of our manufacturing facility in reynosa were to be interrupted by natural disaster or any other event  and we are unable to develop alternative sources for our production needs  we may not be able to meet customer demand for our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  costs of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we have been sued in mexico by a plaintiff who alleges she is the legal owner of all or a portion of the property on which our facility in reynosa is located 
the loss of this lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  costs of revenue and financial condition

olegario cavazos cantu  on behalf of maria leonor cepeda zapata vs 
symbol de mexico  sociedad de rl de rl some components  subassemblies and products are purchased from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers 
the loss of any of these suppliers may cause us to incur additional set up costs  result in delays in manufacturing and delivering our products or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory 
while components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources  we currently depend on a limited number of suppliers for several components for our equipment  and certain subassemblies and products 
some components  subassemblies and products are purchased from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers 
for example  we have a long term strategic relationship with olympus optical  inc of japan pursuant to which olympus and symbol jointly develop selected products that are manufactured by olympus exclusively for sale by us in the field of our business and prospective businesses 
the percentage of our product sales that include products or that contain components manufactured by olympus historically has ranged from approximately to in any given quarterly period 
we have estimated that the temporary adverse impact if we lost olympus as a manufacturer would be approximately of the product sales that include products or that contain components manufactured by olympus or a temporary adverse impact of approximately to of total product sales 
in addition  for certain components  subassemblies and products for which we may have multiple sources  we are still subject to significant price increases and limited availability due to market demand for such components  subassemblies and products 
in the past  unexpected demand for communication products caused worldwide shortages of certain electronic parts  which had an adverse impact on our business 
while we have entered into contracts with suppliers of parts that we anticipate 
table of contents may be in short supply  there can be no assurance that additional parts will not become the subject of such shortages or that such suppliers will be able to deliver the parts in fulfillment of their contracts 
in addition  on occasion  we increase our component inventory in anticipation of supply shortages  which may result in our carrying excess or obsolete components if we do not properly anticipate customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if shortages or delays exist  we may not be able to secure an adequate number of components at reasonable prices and acceptable quality and  therefore  may not be able to meet customer demand for our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
although the availability of components did not materially impact our business in or  we cannot predict when and if component shortages will occur 
we outsource the manufacturing of many of our components and products  and if third party manufacturers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in the financial or business condition of such third party manufacturers  our ability to supply quality products to our customers may be disrupted 
we increasingly depend on outsourced manufacturing  primarily by manufacturers located outside the united states 
our increasing dependence on third party manufacturers for outsourced components subjects us to the risk of supplier failure and customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of our products containing such purchased components 
quality or performance failures by our third party manufacturers or changes in their financial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business  revenues and financial condition 
in addition  third party manufacturers for outsourced components are consolidating in the electronic component industry 
the consolidation of our third party manufacturers for outsourced components may give the remaining and larger third party manufacturers greater leverage to increase the prices that they charge and thereby increase our cost of component parts 
management of our inventory will be complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors 
fluctuations in distributor demand may cause us to reduce our prices and write down inventory  which could result in lower gross margins 
we must manage inventory effectively  particularly with respect to sales to distributors 
our gross inventory at the end of was million with an estimated valuation allowance of million or 
as of december   gross inventory has been reduced to million with an estimated valuation allowance of million or 
management during this time period has improved its management of inventory  particularly its management of its supply chain as well as through its distribution channel 
however  distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages  cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products 
distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end user demand 
if we have excess inventory  we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory  which in turn could result in a lower gross margin 
we sell a majority of our products through resellers  distributors and original equipment manufacturers oems 
if the third party distribution sources on which we rely do not perform their services adequately or efficiently or if they exit the industry  and we are not able to quickly find adequate replacements  there could be a material adverse effect on our revenue 
we sell a majority of our products through resellers  distributors and oems 
some of our third party distribution sources may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in worldwide business conditions  including economic downturn  or abide by our inventory and credit requirements 
if the third party distribution sources on which we rely do not perform their services adequately or efficiently or exit the industry  and we are not able to quickly find adequate replacements  there could be a material adverse effect on our revenue and market share 
in addition  we do not have third party distribution 
table of contents sources in certain parts of the world 
if we are unable to effectively and efficiently supply and service customers outside our current geographic scope  there may be a material adverse effect on our growth rates and result of operations 
in  we implemented a new distribution system called the symbol partnerselect tm program that is designed to increase our business and the business of our resellers  distributors and oems and improve the quality of service and products offered to end users of our products and services 
for example  under the symbol partnerselect tm program  resellers are selected for a program track and level based on a number of different criteria such as hardware  software  and service offerings  number and level of symbol certifications  level of partnership commitment and level of customer support 
if the new program does not continue to be well received by our resellers  distributors and oems  or end users of our products and services  there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results 
for example  one of our former resellers was not selected to participate in the symbol partnerselect tm program and has sued us for unfair competition in europe 
see item legal proceedings 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties assert we are in violation of their intellectual property rights  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to attract new customers and retain current customers 
we protect our proprietary information and technology through licensing agreements  third party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions  as well as through patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be available in all cases or will be adequate to prevent our competitors from copying  reverse engineering or otherwise obtaining and using our technology  proprietary rights or products 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or design around our proprietary rights 
in addition  an important scanner integrated computer patent will expire in in each case  our ability to compete and to receive licensing revenues could be significantly impaired 
to prevent substantial unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights  it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement and or misappropriation of our proprietary rights against third parties 
any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and management s attention  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such action 
in addition  third parties may seek to challenge  invalidate or circumvent our patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets  or applications for any of the foregoing 
furthermore  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be licensed do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
third parties have  and may in the future  assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us or against our partners for which we may be liable under certain terms of indemnification 
due to the rapid pace of technological change in our industry  much of our business and many of our products rely on proprietary technologies of third parties  and we may not be able to obtain  or continue to obtain  licenses from such third parties on reasonable terms 
we have received  and have currently pending  third party claims and may receive additional notices of such claims of infringement in the future 
to date  such activities have not had a material adverse effect on our business  and we have either prevailed in all litigation  obtained a license on commercially acceptable terms or otherwise been able to modify any affected products or technology 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any such patent or other intellectual property would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  any such claim of infringement could result in an injunction that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services 
the failure to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms or the entry of an injunction that impairs our ability to market certain products or services could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
since we and third parties hold a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications related to our business  we believe that there is likely to continue to be significant litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete 
for example  intermec ip corp 
intermec filed suit against matrics prior to the 
table of contents announcement of our acquisition of matrics  asserting infringement of four patents owned by intermec relating to rfid readers  chips  rfid tag operation and the integration of tags with wireless memory devices 
on october   matrics was merged with and into symbol and now symbol is defending the case 
additionally  nanopower technologies  inc nanopower filed suit against matrics and us asserting  among other things  breach of an intellectual property license agreement  breach of a confidentiality agreement and misappropriation of trade secrets relating to a low voltage rfid tag startup technology 
for more details on the intermec litigation  the nanopower litigation and other intellectual property litigation  see item legal proceedings pending patent and trademark litigation 
new safety regulations or changes in existing safety regulations related to our products may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities  which could have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations and future sales and could place additional burdens on the operations of our business 
radio emissions and the use of lasers are subject to regulation in the united states and in other countries in which we do business 
in the united states  various federal agencies including the center for devices and radiological health of the food and drug administration  the federal communications commission  the occupational safety and health administration and various state agencies have promulgated regulation that concern the use of lasers and or radio electromagnetic emissions standards 
member countries of the european community have enacted standards concerning electrical and laser safety and electromagnetic compatibility and emissions standards 
if any of our products becomes subject to new regulations or if any of our products becomes specifically regulated by additional government entities  compliance with such regulations could become more burdensome and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations 
in addition  our wireless communication products operate through the transmission of radio signals 
currently  operation of these products in specified frequency bands does not require licensing by regulatory authorities 
regulatory changes restricting the use of frequency bands or allocating available frequencies could become more burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and future sales 
compliance with environmental matters and worker health and safety laws could be costly and noncompliance with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  expenses and financial condition 
some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal  state  local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground  air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
certain of our products are subject to various federal  state  local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products 
we could be subject to increased costs  fines  civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims if we violate or become liable under environmental and or worker health and safety laws 
in january  the european union eu issued two directives relating to chemical substances in electronic products 
the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive requires producers of electrical goods to pay for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of past and future covered products 
eu governments were required to enact and implement legislation that complies with this directive by august  such legislation together with the directive  the weee legislation  and certain producers are to be financially responsible under the weee legislation beginning in august the eu has issued another directive that requires electrical and electronic equipment placed on the eu market after july  to be free of lead  mercury  cadmium  hexavalent chromium above a threshold limit and brominated flame retardants 
eu governments were required to enact and implement legislation that complies with this directive by august  such legislation together with this directive  the rohs legislation 
if we do not comply with these directives  we may suffer a loss of revenue  be unable to sell in certain markets and or countries  be subject to penalties and enforced fees and or suffer a competitive disadvantage 
similar 
table of contents legislation could be enacted in other jurisdictions  including in the united states 
costs to comply with the weee legislation  rohs legislation and or similar future legislation  if applicable  could include costs associated with modifying our products  recycling and other waste processing costs  legal and regulatory costs and insurance costs 
we may also be required to take reserves for costs associated with compliance with these regulations 
we cannot assure you that the costs to comply with these new laws  or with current and future environmental and worker health and safety laws will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operation  expenses and financial condition 
if we are unable to recruit and retain key employees  this could affect our ability to successfully grow our business 
in order to be successful  we must retain and motivate our executives and other key employees  including those in managerial  technical  marketing and information technology support positions 
in particular  our product generation efforts rely on hiring and retaining qualified engineers 
attracting and retaining skilled solutions providers in the it support business and qualified sales representatives are also critical to our success 
with the exception of mr 
nuti  our president and chief executive officer  none of our current employees has entered into an employment agreement with us and all such individuals are at will employees 
experienced management and technical  marketing and support personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense 
the loss of  or the inability to recruit  key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
covenants in our new credit facility may limit our ability to operate our business  which in turn could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition  and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
our new credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless we satisfy certain financial tests or other criteria 
we must also comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests 
our material us subsidiaries are subject to similar restrictions which may restrict their ability to make certain distributions to us 
our new credit facility contains additional affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  limitations to entering into certain acquisitions  limitations on making capital expenditures  limitations on payment of dividends and limitations on repurchases of common stock under the employee stock purchase program 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants under the new credit facility 
all of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business  which in turn could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition  and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions  we could be in default under our new credit facility  and the debt incurred thereunder  together with accrued interest  could then be declared immediately due and payable 
if we default under our new credit facility  the lenders could cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under our new credit facility to become due and payable  require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness under such new credit facility or prevent us from making debt service payments on our other indebtedness 
if we are unable to repay any borrowings when due  the lenders under our new credit facility could proceed against their collateral  which includes most of the assets we own 
in addition  any default under our new credit facility could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
if the indebtedness under our new credit facility and our other debt instruments is accelerated  we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our new credit facility or indebtedness under our other debt instruments 
our ability to comply with these provisions of the new credit facility may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control

we are a party to lawsuits arising in the normal course of business 
litigation arising in the normal course of business  as well as the lawsuits and investigations described below  can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings and government investigations are difficult to predict 
unless otherwise specified  symbol is currently unable to estimate  with reasonable certainty  the possible loss  or range of loss  if any  for the lawsuits and investigations described herein 
an unfavorable resolution to any of the lawsuits or investigations described below could have a material adverse effect on symbol s business  results of operations or financial condition 
government investigations in may  in response to an inquiry from the sec  we retained a law firm to conduct an internal investigation into certain allegations concerning our accounting practices  focusing on specific transactions with two of our customers but also including a limited review of other large transactions 
the law firm retained an accounting firm to assist it in the investigation 
we subsequently discovered that this investigation was hindered by certain of our former employees 
as a result of actions by these former employees  the sec expressed dissatisfaction with the investigation 
in march  we retained a second law firm to conduct a wide ranging internal investigation into our accounting practices 
the investigation was conducted over a period of approximately eighteen months with the assistance of an outside forensic accounting team 
the sec and the eastern district commenced separate but related investigations relating to our accounting practices 
the investigation found that  during the period covered by the restatement  certain members of former management engaged in  directed and or created an environment that encouraged a variety of inappropriate activities that resulted in accounting errors and irregularities affecting our previously issued financial statements that we have now restated 
the errors and irregularities caused by these actions primarily concerned the timing and amount of product and service revenue recognized 
in particular  the investigation found that revenue was accelerated from the appropriate quarters to earlier quarters through a variety of improper means and  on a more limited basis  revenue was improperly created and inflated on a net basis 

table of contents additionally  there were errors and irregularities associated with the establishment and utilization of certain reserves and restructurings  including certain end of quarter adjustments that were apparently made in order to achieve previously forecasted financial results 
there were also errors and or irregularities associated with the administration of certain options programs  as well as several categories of cost of revenue and operating expenses  including efforts to artificially reduce reported inventory 
in addition  the internal investigation uncovered efforts by certain then employees  including certain members of then management  to impede both the initial and second internal investigations 
the employees responsible for directing such conduct resigned or were terminated 
the investigation found that  in addition to the specific items of misconduct giving rise to the need for the restatement  there was a failure by our former management to establish an appropriate control environment  and there were significant failures in our internal controls and procedures resulting from numerous causes  including inadequate hiring of qualified and experienced personnel  insufficient training and supervision of personnel  a decentralized accounting structure for operations in the united states and inadequate systems and systems interfaces 
the investigation also found instances in which some members of former management and sales and finance related employees devoted insufficient attention and resources to ensuring accurate accounting and financial reporting 
as the guilty pleas of three former senior members of our finance group illustrate  there were also instances in which such activity rose to the level of criminal misconduct 
all of the members of senior management who were primarily responsible for the errors and irregularities underlying the restatement either have been terminated from employment at symbol as part of the internal investigation or have left symbol  including tomo razmilovic  one of our former presidents  chief executive officers and directors  and kenneth jaeggi  our former senior vice president and chief financial officer 
we assembled a new management team and appointed new board members beginning in mid in november  we announced the unaudited  preliminary expected magnitude of the anticipated restatement of our financial statements  and updated that information on several occasions over the subsequent eleven months 
accordingly  the selected financial data for   and  financial statements for the years ended december  and  and unaudited selected quarterly information for each of the four quarters of and the first three quarters of were restated in our annual report on form k a 
in connection with our accounting practices various class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our former management and our former board of directors in march  march and may for more information see securities litigation matters 
on june   we announced that we resolved the investigation by the eastern district relating to our past accounting practices by entering into a non prosecution agreement with the eastern district 
as a result of this non prosecution agreement  no criminal complaint will be filed against us 
in addition  on june   we announced an agreement with the sec to resolve allegations against us relating to our past accounting practices that were under investigation by the sec 
pursuant to the agreements with the eastern district and the sec  we have paid a total of million in cash to a restitution fund for members of the class consisting of purchasers of our common stock from february  to october   and million to the united states postal inspection service consumer fraud fund 
in addition to these payments  the non prosecution agreement included an acknowledgement by us that between and  as a result of the actions of certain of our former employees  we a violated federal criminal law in connection with accounting practices involving improper sales transactions  unsupported and fictitious accounting entries and the manipulation of our accounting reserves and expenses  and b filed and caused to be filed materially false and misleading financial statements and other documents with the sec 
as part of the non prosecution agreement  we agreed to continue our cooperation with the eastern district and the sec  and to implement remedial measures  including  but not limited to  retaining an independent  government approved examiner to review our internal controls  financial reporting practices and our compliance with the settlement agreements and establishing and maintaining an annual training and education program designed to diminish the possibility of future violations of the federal securities laws 
if we violate the agreement with the eastern district or the injunction with the sec or commit or attempt to commit other violations  such as accounting offenses that were not the subject of 
table of contents the investigations  we will be subject to federal criminal charges 
pursuant to the non prosecution agreement we have waived certain defenses that may have otherwise been available to us in the event of a federal criminal charge  including the statute of limitations  and will be subject to prosecution for any offense  including any offense related to our past accounting practices 
in addition  in the event of a violation of the agreement and a federal criminal charge  statements that were made by or on behalf of us to the eastern district  sec and the postal inspection service  including the acknowledgments of responsibility described above  will be deemed admissible in evidence and certain evidentiary rules will not be available to us 
pursuant to the agreement with the sec  the sec filed  and the court has approved  a final consent judgment in the eastern district of new york providing for injunctive relief  enjoining us from further violations of the antifraud  reporting  books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws  and a civil penalty in the amount of million  as described above 
we paid both the million and the million to the united states postal inspection service consumer fraud fund prior to june  on october   the company issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third quarter on november   the company issued a second press release  revising certain of the previously reported numbers 
the revised numbers included a reduction of approximately million in revenue for the nine months ending september   as compared to the results previously reported in the press release of october  the november  press release stated that the company had discovered certain discrepancies in the amount of inventory at a distributor as well as inventory on hand that affected its previously announced results 
on november   the company filed its form q for the third quarter of the non prosecution agreement between the company and the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of new york  described previously  provides that should the company violate the agreement or commit a crime in the future  the company would be subject to prosecution for any offense  including any offense related to the company s past accounting practices 
the company has retained outside counsel to investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding the erroneous numbers included in the october  press release 
the company has been cooperating with the informal requests made by the eastern district and by the sec regarding this matter  including whether symbol has complied with the injunction entered into in connection with its june settlement with the sec and non prosecution agreement with the eastern district

on march   smi filed its answer and counterclaim denying telxon s allegations and alleging counterclaims against telxon for negligent misrepresentation  estoppel  tortious interference with business relationship and intentional misrepresentation and seeking approximately million in compensatory damages  punitive damages  fees and costs 
in addition  william dupre  an individual employed by smi at that time  asserted similar counterclaims against telxon 
in november  symbol acquired telxon with these claims still pending 

table of contents on september   the jury awarded approximately million in damages against telxon  of which approximately million was awarded to mr 
dupre 
the court denied telxon s motions for judgment in its favor notwithstanding the verdict  for a new trial and for a reduction in the amount of the jury verdicts 
on may   the court entered judgment against telxon for approximately million in damages  plus statutory interest from the date of the verdicts and granted a motion to add symbol as a counterclaim defendant with respect to the counterclaims asserted by mr

in addition  we currently have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements with respect to the jury verdicts and the judgment entered as we believe that  in accordance with the relevant guidance set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  an unfavorable outcome of this litigation is not probable at this time 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not be found to be ultimately liable for the full amount of the judgment  plus statutory interest from the date of the verdicts 
in the event we are found liable  and the judgment is not paid  we would be in violation of the terms of our new credit facility

in addition  we have taken significant steps to improve our manufacturing efficiencies by moving the majority of our manufacturing to lower cost  company owned and contract production facilities outside the united states

management continuously evaluates its financial condition and operational performance by monitoring key performance measures such as revenue growth  gross profit and gross profit percent  operating income and margin  cash flow from operations  days sales outstanding and inventory turns 
in addition to these financial and operational measures  management has established certain other key measures to evaluate its future business performance  such as product bookings and product backlog as well as product sales through its indirect channel from both value added resellers vars and distributors  and original equipment manufacturers oems 
in addition  management has a strong focus on its customer satisfaction ratings in its service business 
by evaluating our product bookings  we are able to gain visibility into the momentum of our expected future sales volumes 
this evaluation helps us to identify areas where we may need to adjust our sales and 
table of contents marketing efforts and inventory management 
our goal is to maintain our quarterly product bookings to our actual product revenue recognized ratio above in addition  we evaluate the amount of backlog of products that we have shipped but have not recognized as revenue  as well as those products that are awaiting shipment 
this evaluation  we believe  assists us in improving our quarterly linearity of shipments  and improves our operational efficiencies and overall inventory management 
our goal is to continually grow our backlog 
we also believe that we need to build a strong partner ecosystem  which is a key aspect in our ability to scale our business and important in our efforts to penetrate new markets as well as boost our presence in our existing vertical markets 
to that extent  in we began migrating to a channel centric business model and introduced our partnerselect tm program 
our goal is to have over of our products shipped through our indirect channels  that is our vars  distributors and oems 
in our services segment  a key measure we monitor is customer satisfaction  particularly for technical assistance and depot service delivery 
we continually conduct independent customer satisfaction surveys  with an overall goal of achieving ratings consistently above a on a scale of to  with being the highest level of satisfaction 
we also monitor the attach rates of our service maintenance contracts to our product sales  which we believe gives us visibility into future growth of our services segment

our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was for the year ended december   an increase from for the year ended december  our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was for the year ended december   an increase from for the year ended december  these increases were primarily due to our increased sales of higher margin product as well as efficiencies we have achieved in our manufacturing operations 
also contributing to the improved operating results in was the absence of several charges recorded during for the impairment of certain software assets  a provision for a loss contract  as well as severance  restructuring and warranty related charges 
these charges aggregated  in we are committed to and continue to invest in engineering new products and in investing in our people  processes and systems to expand our product offerings  to improve our control environment and our effectiveness with our customers and our operational efficiencies

table of contents our inventory turns increased to from for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year primarily due to improved efficiencies in our manufacturing and distribution operations as well as managing material receipts more effectively 
our gross product bookings increased to  for the three months ended december  from  for the three months ended september  the ratio of our product bookings to product revenue was for the quarter ended december  our product backlog  which is another measure we monitor  continued to grow in the quarter  ending december  at  which included  of additional backlog from matrics 
essentially all of the reported backlog is expected to be shipped to the customer within six months 
product backlog as of december  was our percent of product revenue that was shipped through our indirect channel in the year ended december  was

current results of customer satisfaction surveys from our services business have demonstrated improvement towards our goal of a consistent rating greater than out of a possible rating of our most current results were a score of and  relating to satisfaction with our technical assistance and depot service delivery  respectively 
while our attach rates have been improving in our sales in the americas  overall we believe we can achieve better attach rates and are making changes in our business process and restructuring certain aspects of our service activities to help improve these attach rates in the future 
because a large concentration of our customers are in the retail sector  the health of the economy  consumer spending and the financial health of our retail customers and their capital expenditures related to their informational technology spending are important factors we consider when making our short and long term strategic decisions 
we remain cautiously optimistic about the economic recovery for information technology products in this sector of our business 
we are focused on increasing profitable sales and growing market share  specifically through our channel centric business model and our partnerselect tm program 
our products face pricing pressure typical of a technology company 
once a product is introduced in the marketplace  its selling price usually decreases over the life of the product 
to lessen the effect of price decreases  we often develop enhancements to our existing products as well as attempt to reduce manufacturing costs in order to maintain our profit margin on such products and our overall product portfolio 
demand for many of our products and services remained strong throughout and as a result we do not anticipate a significant decline in our pricing structure during we continue to focus on programs that will enhance our operational efficiencies and reduce our cost structure  including consolidating general and administrative activities  consolidating service repair centers  improving our distribution channels and our engineering activities 
in we made a strategic acquisition  acquiring matrics  a leader in developing electronic product code rfid systems 
the rfid market is at the early stages of development 
however we currently believe that the costs we will incur during the product life cycle for both existing technology and future  replacement rfid technology will be consistent with the expenditures we have incurred in developing and maintaining our existing enterprise mobility solutions

product revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or from the prior year 
this increase included  of revenue related to matrics from september   the date we acquired matrics 
the increase was primarily due to continued growth in sales volume of our mobile computing product offerings  our largest product line  which experienced growth of  an increase of from the prior year 
contributing to this increase is the growth in sales volume of both our next generation mobile gun and rugged handheld mobile computing devices 
also contributing to the product revenue increase was growth in sales volume of our advanced data capture product line of  an increase of from the prior year  which was primarily driven by continued growth in next generation scanners  which included a large rollout of wireless point of sale scanners to a nationwide us retailer 
in addition  there was a significant purchase of point of sale terminals by a nationwide us retailer during the year ended december  wireless product revenue increased by  an increase of for the year ended december   respectively  from the prior year primarily due to the introduction of a new wireless

the increase in revenue within the mobile computing  advanced data capture and wireless infrastructure product divisions for the year ended december  was primarily driven by increased sales volume as the pricing structure remained relatively consistent as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in other  net for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased rebates to our distribution partners due to changes to the partnerselect tm model combined with their increased sales volume 
this was partially offset by an increase in royalty revenue 
services revenue for the year ended december  was  a decrease of from the prior year 
the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was due to our continued drive to utilize third party service providers for lower margin professional service activities and a lower level of cash collections compared to the prior year as a portion of our us service revenue is recognized on a billed and collected basis 
this was partially offset by a positive impact of  which was the result of recording a majority of new contracts on an accrual basis from a billed and collected basis effective july  geographically  the americas revenue increased for the year ended december   from the prior year 
europe  middle east and africa emea revenue increased  for the year ended december   from the increases in the americas and emea revenues are mainly attributable to strong growth in all of our product offerings

the increase in product gross profit was mainly due to an increase in revenue which accounted for  of the increase 
the remaining increase to product gross profit of approximately  was due to an increase in gross profit percentage of  for the year ended december  the increase in our gross profit percentage was primarily due to a change in our product mix and increased efficiencies gained in our manufacturing operations 
service gross profit for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  from the prior year 
the decrease in service gross profit for the year ended december  was primarily due to restructuring charges relating to lease obligation costs and further workforce reductions  coupled with the decline in revenues partially offset by a change in mix from low margin professional services to higher margin maintenance and support services 
operating expenses total operating expenses of  increased for the year ended december  from  for the prior year 
operating expenses consisted of the following for the years ended december for the year ended december  variance in variance in dollars percentage write off of acquired in process research and development engineering selling  general and administrative recovery provision for legal settlements stock based compensation expense restructuring and impairment charges 
table of contents the write off of acquired in process research and development costs ipr d of  for the year ended december  is in connection with our acquisition of matrics 
such amount allocated to ipr d represented a portion of the total value of the acquired assets 
we believe the matrics acquisition is an important step in executing our plan to be a leader in rfid and will expand our offerings in the advanced data capture industry 
our assumptions for ipr d were based on our estimate of the present value of the cash flows arising from each of the material research and development projects in which matrics was investing at the time of closing 
each project was evaluated based on the income approach 
with the exception of the proprietary manufacturing process  this was achieved by discounting cash flows to be derived from the sales of the products to their present value 
for the proprietary manufacturing process  the income approach was used by estimating the gross margin benefit from the technology and discounting the cash flows from that gross margin benefit 
the values prescribed to the ipr d and the technology assets acquired were based upon several factors including the generation of the technology acquired  the estimated lives and future revenue and costs associated with the technology 
the products included in ipr d ranged from the early stages of development to the latter stages of development at the time of acquisition 
a discount rate ranging from to was used for the projects to account for various risks  including the technical risk  the risk that customers will not desire to purchase the product  the risk around significant price erosion  the risk of commercializing the technology  the risk that even once successfully commercialized the technology may not yield the gross margin benefit and for the broader market risk associated with the adoption of rfid 
engineering expenses increased  or for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  mainly due to our increased investment in our research and development 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  mainly due to higher compensation costs and related benefits particularly in our sales force  investment in technology  infrastructure and financial systems  external consulting costs associated with our compliance efforts under the sarbanes oxley act of  partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with our restatement activities and legal fees associated with litigation activities 
legal settlements for the year ended december  decreased  this decrease is driven by the fact that the year ended december  included recoveries of  related to our various legal matters  while the prior year ended december  included a provision related to certain legal settlements of  also included in total operating expenses is stock based compensation associated with certain portions of our stock option plans 
as of march   due to our inability to make timely filings with the sec  our stock option plans were held in abeyance  meaning that our employees could not exercise their options until we became current with our filings 
as an accommodation to both current and former symbol associates whose options were impacted by this suspension  the compensation committee of the board approved an abeyance program that allowed associates whose options were affected during the suspension period the right to exercise such options up to days after the end of the suspension period 
this resulted in a new measurement date for those options  which led to a non cash accounting compensation charge for the intrinsic value of those vested options when the employee either terminated employment during the suspension period or within the day period after the end of the suspension period 
stock based compensation related to the abeyance program was  during the year ended december on february   the date on which we became current with our regulatory filings with the sec  this suspension period ended

b included in s interest expense are  of financing costs associated with a million short term facility entered into in september which was refinanced in december provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was 
this differs from the statutory rate of for several reasons 
the rate is increased by the non deductible portion of the class action settlement reached in and write off of ipr d associated with the acquisition of matrics 
the rate is reduced by the tax benefits of research credits  the reduction of valuation allowances primarily associated with the company s foreign tax credit carryforwards and export sales benefits 
without the matrics acquisition  the tax rate for the year ended december  would have been 
as part of determining the company s annual income tax provision  we evaluated the need for valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that all  or a portion of  a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income  the character of income and other available evidence 
three forecasts of future sources of taxable income were prepared based on various assumptions concerning the growth of the company s business operations that are subject to income tax in the united states 
the reversal of all significant timing differences was considered in calculating the forecasted taxable income under each scenario 
the estimated income tax payable was then calculated based on the tax rates in effect as of december  tax credits including a forecast of expected tax credits that will arise in each year of the forecast were then applied to reduce the tax  subject to existing limitations under the applicable tax laws 
based on these forecasts  substantially all of the deferred tax assets would be utilized well before the underlying tax attributes expiration periods 
in addition  the company prepared an historical analysis of its taxable income and cash tax liability position for the years through during this time period  the company generated net taxable income of  which resulted in over  of tax before credits 

table of contents based on the strength of the evidence  the company has concluded that no valuation allowance is required with respect to the deferred tax assets that were included in the analyses 
however  a valuation allowance has been recorded for the potential future income tax attributes associated with certain state and local income tax net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at december  these carryforwards relate to legal entities required to file separate company state and local income tax returns and thus such entities cannot rely on the above consolidated forecasts 
the company expects to settle all or a substantial part of its income tax audit with the internal revenue service for tax years during on october  the president signed the american jobs creation act of ajca 
the ajca creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and  as of today  uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions of the act 
as such  we are not yet in a position to decide on whether  and to what extent  we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us based on analysis to date  we expect to repatriate up to  in accordance with this temporary incentive 
the resulting tax impact of repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time

operating expenses operating expenses of  increased for the year ended december  from  in these increases were largely driven by the accounting treatment related to our stock based compensation plans which resulted in additional costs of  for the year ended december   as compared to a recovery of  in also contributing to the increased operating expenses were costs associated with our restatement and the government investigation as further described below 
in connection with the exercise of stock options  an informal practice began in or around the early s  whereby certain stock option plan participants including certain officers and directors were afforded a look back period no more than days for purposes of determining the market price to be used in connection with the specific exercise 
in addition  these individuals were given an extended period of time in which to pay for their option exercises 
these practices were contrary to the terms of the relevant option plans 
as this practice allowed certain participants to choose exercise dates outside of the approved plan terms and also allowed these participants to extend the period of time in which to pay for their option exercise  the price of the option at grant date was not fixed and determinable 
accordingly  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  our financial statements reflect as compensation expense the change in market price of the common stock underlying these options granted to plan participants that could have participated in this practice from the date of grant until the options either expired or were exercised 
effective july   this practice of options exercise ended resulting in ceasing the accounting for such options under variable plan accounting 
the  represents the change in market price of common stock underlying these options granted through the seven month period ended july  as of march   due to the inability of symbol to make timely filings with the sec  our stock option plans were held in abeyance  meaning that our employees could not exercise their options until we became current with our filings

on february   the date on which we became current with our regulatory filings with the sec  this suspension period ended 
in addition  due to our delinquent filings with the sec  we incurred non cash compensation expenses associated with our employee stock purchase plan espp as the espp lost its exempt tax status 
engineering and selling  general and administrative expenses are summarized in the following table for the year ended december  variance in variance in dollars percentage engineering percentage of total revenue selling  general and administrative percentage of total revenue 
table of contents engineering costs for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the increase was due to the acquisition of covigo to expand our software solutions offerings  and continued investment in our product offerings 
the increase was consistent with projected and actual revenue growth as engineering spending as a percentage of revenue remained relatively constant in the range 
the increased spending was spread across all product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the increase was attributable to additional professional fees associated with our internal investigation as well as higher variable costs due to a increase in revenue  partially offset by the absence of a  pre tax severance charge recorded in for tomo razmilovic  one of our former presidents and chief executive officers 
in early we initiated a series of investigations into the accounting misconduct of our former management with the assistance of an independent counsel and an outside accounting firm 
as a result of this internal investigation  the sec and eastern district investigations and the related class action lawsuits against us  we incurred additional professional fees of  in as compared with  incurred in the increase was also attributable to severance costs incurred during aggregating  primarily for the reorganization and releveling of the international sales organization 
reflected in our operating expenses for the year ended december  was a  loss provision for legal settlements related to the then ongoing sec and eastern district investigations and the then outstanding class action lawsuits against us 
this compared to charges totaling  recorded in  of which  related to the then ongoing sec and eastern district investigations and the then outstanding class action lawsuits against us and  related to a securities fraud class action litigation related to telxon  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
other expense income interest expense for the year ended december  decreased to  or from  in primarily due to reduced debt levels as a result of the repurchase in of telxon s remaining convertible debt  net repayments under our revolving credit facility and annual mandatory repayments of other indebtedness  without incurring any new borrowings in or interest income for the year ended december  increased to  from  for  primarily due to the investments of additional cash from operations into overnight deposits with local banks  primarily in our non us locations 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our investments for impairment 
as part of this evaluation  we reviewed our investment in airclic  inc airclic 
in consideration of the then current financial outlook of airclic s business  the general decline in the economy and the decline in information technology spending  it was determined that the decline in the value of our investment in airclic was other than temporary during the quarter ended june  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of  which was included in the impairment of investments as a component of other expense income in the consolidated statements of operations at december  and wrote down the carrying amount of the investment to its estimated fair value of  during  we invested another in airclic  bringing our investment to  we determined in that this investment would not be recoverable and wrote off this investment in its entirety in in accordance with the provisions of sfas no

our primary liquidity requirements continue to be for working capital  engineering costs  and financing and investing activities 
based on our current level of operations  cash flow from operations has been sufficient to meet our liquidity needs to fund operations as well as our liquidity needs created by changes in working capital 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient for at least the next months 
in addition  we will  from time to time  consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses that might affect liquidity requirements and cause us to pursue additional financing

net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the prior year 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased  during the year ended december  as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to our use of cash to reduce and pay down our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by increased net earnings 
included in the use of cash was the  payment as required by the eastern district and the sec to resolve the government investigations and the  settlement related to the telxon class action lawsuit that was paid in february partially offset by cash recoveries related to these legal settlements of  
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased to  a improvement from the  reported in the improvement was primarily attributable to improved gross profit margins as well as better management of managing receivables and inventory

net cash used in investing activities principally consisted of net investments in other companies and capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
the increase of cash used of  during the year ended december   when compared to the prior year  was primarily due to approximately  used in connection with the matrics acquisition  approximately  in additional capital expenditures  primarily related to our investment in technology  infrastructure and financial systems and the  bond symbol and telxon posted as security for a trial court judgment on appeal 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  an increase from  reported in  primarily resulting from increased purchases of property  plant and equipment due to investments made in administrative software and systems to enhance our back office capabilities and improve customer service

however  the dso numbers shown above may not be directly comparable to those of other companies because our dso numbers are improved by the timing of our revenue recognized for our distributors  cash received in advance of revenue recognition  part of our service revenue in the americas and our value added resellers that lack economic substance  which we recognize on a billed and collected basis 
we continue to effectively manage our net accounts receivables  ending december  with receivables of  a decrease of  from  at december  through aggressive collection strategies we have been able to reduce days sales outstanding to days during the year ended december  from days in the year ended december  our inventory turns increased to from for the year ended december  compared to the year ended primarily due to improved efficiencies in our manufacturing and distribution operations as well as more effectively managing materials receipts

accounts receivable decreased due to improved cash collections  however a portion of the cash generated was used to pay down and reduce our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses 
current liabilities as of december  increased  from december  primarily due to our credit facility entered into to finance our acquisition of matrics  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
as a result  working capital decreased  between december  and december  included in our current liabilities at december  is  related to an amount due to our settlement of certain litigation

current liabilities as of december  increased  from december  primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of which  was an additional liability established in for settlements of the sec and eastern district investigations and related securities fraud class action lawsuits 
as a result  working capital decreased  between december  and december  our current ratio of at december  decreased from at december  financing activities as of december  and december   there were no borrowings outstanding under our prior revolving credit facility 
during  we entered into a  lease receivable securitization agreement  which matured on december  and was subsequently extended until december for the year ended december   we securitized  of lease receivables  which resulted in upfront proceeds from new securitizations of  as of december   we had the ability to securitize  under the lease receivable securitization agreement 
factors that are reasonably likely to affect our ability to continue using these financing arrangements include the ability to generate lease receivables that qualify for securitization and the ability of the financial institution to obtain an investment grade rating for such securitization from either of the two major credit rating agencies 
we do not consider the securitization of lease receivables to be a significant contributing factor to our continued liquidity

as of december   we are in compliance with the covenants under the new credit facility 
on march   we entered into a purchase money secured installment loan with a bank for  the loan is payable in four semiannual installments of  including interest  commencing october  the proceeds received under the loan were used to finance the purchases of certain software 
in january  we entered into a private mandatorily exchangeable securities contract for shared appreciation income linked securities sails with a highly rated financial institution 
the securities that underlie the sails contract represent our investment in cisco common stock  which was acquired in connection with the telxon acquisition 
the  shares of cisco common stock had a market value of  at december  and  at december  such shares are held as collateral to secure the debt instrument associated with the sails and are included in investments in marketable securities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets 
this debt has a seven year maturity and we pay interest at a cash coupon rate of 
in january  the sails debt will be exchangeable for shares of cisco common stock or  at our option  cash in lieu of shares 
net proceeds from the issuance of the sails and termination of an existing freestanding collar arrangement were approximately  which were used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of debt under the then outstanding revolving credit facility 
the sails contain an embedded equity collar  which effectively hedges the exposure to fluctuations in the fair value of 
table of contents our holdings in cisco common stock 
we account for the embedded equity collar as a derivative financial instrument in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the gain or loss on changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized through earnings in the period of change together with a substantial offsetting gain or loss on the cisco shares 
the derivative has been combined with the debt instrument in long term debt in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and presented on a net basis as permitted under fin no 
 offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts  as there exists a legal right of offset 
the sails liability  net of the derivative asset  represents  at december  the remaining portion of long term debt outstanding relates primarily to capital lease obligations 
contractual cash obligations the following is a summary of the contractual commitments associated with our obligations as of december  year ended december  total thereafter long term debt capital lease commitments co marketing commitments purchase obligations operating lease commitments total the purchase obligations above  do not include purchase obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities 
purchase obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on symbol and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable prices provisions  and the appropriate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are generally fulfilled by our vendors within a short time frame 
currently  our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations and the new credit facility 
our primary liquidity requirements continue to be working capital  engineering costs  and financing and investing activities 
our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our new credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for the next months 
we may also be required to make future cash outlays in connection with outstanding legal contingencies 
these potential cash outlays could be material and might affect liquidity requirements and cause us to pursue additional financing 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our new credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund these and our other liquidity needs or pay our indebtedness 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

table of contents on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to product return reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  legal contingencies  inventory valuation  warranty reserves  useful lives of long lived assets  goodwill  derivative instrument valuations and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements product return reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts we record as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated product returns 
the estimated amount is based on historical experience of similar products sold to our customers and then returned 
if our product mix or customer base changes significantly  this could result in a change to our future estimated product return reserve 
management believes the reserve for product returns is adequate to cover anticipated credits issued for such returns  however  if future returns differ from our historical experience and estimates  then this could result in an increase in the reserve 
an increase of one percent in the reserve percentage would result in an increase in our estimated product return reserve of approximately  as of december  we record accounts receivable  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
throughout the year  we estimate our ability to collect outstanding receivables and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in doing so  we evaluate the age of our receivables  past collection history  current financial conditions for key customers  and economic conditions 
based on this evaluation  we establish a reserve for specific accounts receivable that we believe are uncollectible 
a deterioration in the financial condition of any key customer or a significant slowing in the economy could have a material negative impact on our ability to collect a portion or all of the accounts receivable 
we believe that analysis of historical trends and current knowledge of potential collection problems provides us significant information to establish a reasonable estimate for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers  our actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and accruals are established when we are able to estimate the probable outcome of these matters in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies 
such estimates of outcome are derived from consultation with in house and outside legal counsel  as well as an assessment of litigation and settlement strategies 
in many cases  outcomes of such matters are determined by third parties  including governmental entities and judicial bodies 
any provisions made in our financial statements  as well as related disclosures  represent management s best estimates of the current status of such matters and its potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with in house and outside legal counsel 
our estimates may change from period to period based on changes in facts and circumstances  process of negotiations in settling matters and changes determined by management 
as further described under the caption item legal proceedings  we are in litigation with smartmedia of delaware  inc currently  we do not have a liability recorded on our balance sheet related to this matter as we believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable 
however  should circumstances change due to new developments related to this matter changes in our estimates may need to be made and recorded amounts and costs could be material 
inventory valuation we record our inventories at the lower of historical cost or market value 
in assessing the ultimate realization of recorded amounts  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with the current or committed inventory levels 
projected demand levels  economic conditions  
table of contents business restructurings  technological innovation and product life cycles are variables we assess when determining our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
we have experienced significant changes in required reserves in recent periods due to these variables 
at the end of and  our inventory reserves were estimated at  or of gross inventory and  or of gross inventory respectively 
as of december  such reserves have been reduced to  or of gross inventory 
the reduction of reserves was the result of the write off and scrapping of inventory and the sale of inventory 
in addition  should future demand requirements change after a reserve has been established  there is the possibility that we could have future sales of product that has been previously reserved 
this occurred in  when a sale of approximately  was recorded on inventory in the fourth quarter of  which was fully reserved for in prior periods 
while we continue to believe that our recorded reserves and policy for determining the reserve requirement are appropriate  it is possible that significant changes in required inventory reserves may continue to occur in the future if there is a deterioration in market conditions or acceleration in technological change and we may experience future sales of product that may be reserved for based on our analysis of future demands and past experiences 
warranty reserves we provide standard warranty coverage for most of our products for a period of one year from the date of shipment 
we record a liability for estimated warranty claims based on historical claims  product failure rates and other factors 
this liability primarily includes the anticipated cost of materials  labor and shipping necessary to repair and service the equipment 
our warranty obligation is affected by the products actually under warranty  product failure rates  material usage rates  and the efficiency by which the product failure is corrected 
should our warranty policy change or should actual failure rates  material usage and labor efficiencies differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
a five percent increase in our products under warranty would cause an approximate increase to our warranty provision at december  useful lives of long lived assets we estimate the useful lives of our long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  identifiable finite life intangible assets and software development costs for internal use in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the estimated lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as taking into consideration anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly or slowly than anticipated  or in a different form  useful lives may need to be changed accordingly  resulting in either an increase or decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
we review these assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important and that could trigger an impairment review include significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired asset  technological advances  changes in historical or projected operating performance and cash flows and significant negative economic trends 
goodwill impairments our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques in the high technology mobile computing industry 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we test on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate a potential impairment may exist to its carrying value 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 

table of contents derivative instruments  hedging activities and foreign currency we utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate risk exposures related to foreign currency denominated payments from our international subsidiaries 
we also utilize a derivative financial instrument to hedge fluctuations in the fair value of our investment in cisco common shares 
our foreign exchange derivatives qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we do not participate in speculative derivatives trading 
while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if hedges did not qualify as highly effective  or if we did not believe the forecasted transactions would occur  the changes in fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings and could be material 
income taxes assessment of the appropriate amount and classification of income taxes are dependent on several factors  including estimates of the timing and probability of the realization of deferred income taxes and the timing of tax payments 
deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates  that if changed  would result in either an increase or decrease in the reported income taxes in the period of change 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income  the character of income needed to realize future tax benefits  and other available evidence 
our assessment of future taxable income is based on historical results  exclusive of non recurring or unusual charges and management s assessment of future taxable income and other known transactions which would result in taxable income 
three forecasts of future sources of taxable income were prepared based on various assumptions concerning the growth of the company s business operations that are subject to income tax in the united states 
the reversal of all significant timing differences was considered in calculating the forecasted taxable income under each scenario 
the estimated income tax payable was then calculated based on the tax rates in effect as of december  tax credits including a forecast of expected tax credits that will arise in each year of the forecast were then applied to reduce the tax  subject to existing limitations under the applicable tax laws 
based on these forecasts  substantially all of the deferred tax assets would be utilized well before the underlying tax attributes expiration periods 
we have had a number of isolated items in the past that have had a negative impact on our taxable income  however  we do not expect these items to recur in the future 
we are projecting taxable income in the future 
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to future impacts of various items  including changes in tax laws  positions taken by governmental authorities relative to the deductibility of certain expenses we incur  changes in our financial condition and results of operations  as well as final review of our tax returns by various taxing authorities that are under audit in the normal course of buiness 
our critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  statement r which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 

table of contents statement r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt statement r on july  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement r for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt statement r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement r  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options granted under our option plans 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement r as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such tax deductions were  and in  and  respectively 
based on the release of statement r  we plan on amending our employee stock purchase program espp to reduce the discount of the price of the shares purchased by employees in the espp from its current discount of to a discount of  and we will also eliminate the look back period currently utilized to determine the price of the shares purchased 
these changes will allow the espp to continue to be non compensatory  which will result in no compensation expense to be recorded by us in our statement of operations when we implement statement r 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we have a formal policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the policy permits the use of financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that may arise in the normal course of our business 
currently  we do not use any financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
the counterparties in derivative transactions that we have entered into are major financial institutions with ratings of a or better  as determined by one of the major credit rating services 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
during  the principal transactions hedged were short term intercompany sales 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency loans correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts 
table of contents and foreign currency loans and the offsetting losses and gains on hedged transactions are reflected as a component of operating results in our consolidated statements of operations 
a large percentage of our sales are transacted in local currencies 
as a result  our international operating results are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a strengthening of the us dollar against every applicable foreign currency would have had a  negative impact on our revenue for the year ended december   while a weakening of the us dollar against every applicable foreign currency would have had a  positive impact on our revenue for the year ended december  we did not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge expected revenue for the year ended december  however  we acquire a portion of our raw materials using local currencies 
the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against local currency would act as a partial offset to the impact on revenue 
we manufacture a significant portion of our products at our mexico facility and we generally invoice our international subsidiaries in their local currency for finished and semi finished goods 
as a result  our us dollar cash flow is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
as of december   a strengthening of the us dollar against every applicable currency would have had a  negative impact on the value of the realized cash remittances from our subsidiaries during the year ended december   while a weakening of the us dollar against every applicable currency would have had a  positive impact on the value of the realized cash remittances from our subsidiaries 
we routinely use foreign exchange contracts to hedge cash flows that are either firm commitments or those which may be forecasted to occur 
while components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources  we currently depend on a single source or a limited number of suppliers for several components of our equipment  certain subassemblies and certain of our products 
a loss of one of these suppliers may have an adverse effect on our ability to deliver our products or to deliver them on time or to manufacture them at anticipated cost levels 
however  due to the general availability of components and supplies  we do not believe that the loss of any supplier or subassembly manufacturer would have a long term material adverse effect on our business  although set up costs and delays could occur in the short term if we changed any single source supplier 
we currently hold an investment in cisco common stock  which is accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
at december    shares are classified as trading securities and shares are classified as available for sale securities 
they are carried at fair market value based on their quoted market price 
as such  we have exposure to market risk related to the fluctuation of cisco s stock price 
however  the change in fair value of the cisco stock price is mitigated by the change in fair value of the embedded equity collar contained in the sails arrangement 
as of december   a increase in the risk free interest rate used to value the option would have a negative earnings impact of  while a increase in the assumed volatility used to value the option would have a positive earnings impact of
