december  in thousands consolidated balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents working capital total assets total stockholders equity item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
we base these estimates on our historical experience  future expectations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates and assumptions relate to estimates of collectibility of accounts receivable  the realization of goodwill  the expected term of a client relationship  accruals and other factors 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and any differences could be material 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported consolidated financial results include the following revenue recognition liveperson is a leading provider of solutions for managing online customer interactions 
our hosted software enables companies to identify and proactively engage the right customer  using the right communication channel  at the right time 
liveperson s fully integrated multi channel communications platform  timpani  facilitates real time sales  customer service and marketing 
our technology supports and manages all online interactions chat  email and self service knowledgebase in a cost effective and secure environment 
we charge a monthly fee  which varies by service and client usage 
certain of our larger clients  who require more sophisticated implementation and training  may also pay an initial non refundable set up fee 
we also occasionally charge professional service fees related to additional training and business consulting and analysis 
the initial set up fee is intended to recover certain costs principally customer service  training and other administrative costs prior to the deployment of our services 
such fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over a period of months  representing the estimated term of the client relationships 
although we believe this estimate is reasonable  this estimate may change in the future 
in instances where we do charge a set up fee  we typically do not charge an additional set up fee if an existing client adds more services 
unamortized deferred fees  if any  are recognized upon termination of the agreement with the customer 
we recognized set up fees due to client attrition of  and  in  and  respectively 
we also sell certain of the liveperson timpani services directly via internet download 
these services are marketed as timpani sb for small and medium sized businesses  and are paid for almost exclusively by credit card 
credit card payments accelerate cash flow and reduce our collection risk  subject to the merchant bank s right to hold back cash pending settlement of the transactions 
sales executed via internet download may occur with or without the assistance of an online sales representative  rather than through face to face or telephone contact that is typically required for traditional direct sales 
sales of the liveperson services via internet download typically have no set up fee  because we do not provide the customer with training and administrative costs are minimal 
we record revenue for traditional direct sales and internet download sales based upon a monthly fee charged for the liveperson services  provided that no significant company obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we recognize monthly service revenue fees as services are provided 
our service agreements typically have no termination date and are terminable by either party upon to days notice without penalty 
we recognize professional service fees upon completion and customer acceptance of the professional service engagement 
accounts receivable our customers are primarily concentrated in the united states 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition except for customers who purchase the liveperson services by credit card via internet download and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers  historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable  although they may change in the future 
if there is a deterioration of a customer s credit worthiness or actual write offs are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of recoverability for these receivables could be adversely affected 
our concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers 
no single customer accounted for or exceeded of our total revenue in  and one customer accounted for approximately of accounts receivable at december  two customers accounted for approximately of accounts receivable at december  impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of property and equipment  intangibles  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  accounts receivable  the expected term of a client relationship  accruals and other factors 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
restructuring activities restructuring activities  prior to january   were accounted for in accordance with the guidance provided in the consensus opinion of the emerging issues task force eitf  in connection with eitf issue no

we also would record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation would be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation

in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
we apply fin r to variable interest vies created after december  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value method at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest in the vie

we were incorporated in the state of delaware in november and the initial liveperson service was introduced in november in july  we acquired all of the existing customer contracts of newchannel  inc and associated rights 
the purchase price was based  in part  on projected revenue from each of the former newchannel clients at the time of their successful conversion to the liveperson software platform 
our acquisition cost was approximately million  including the initial purchase price payment of  to newchannel 
the total acquisition cost has been allocated to customer contracts and was amortized ratably over a period of months  representing the then expected term of the client relationships 
as of december   the total purchase had been completely amortized 
in december  we acquired certain identifiable assets of island data corporation 
the purchase price was based on projected revenue from the acquired customer contracts at the time of their assignment to us 
as of december   we paid approximately  in cash  and issued  shares of our common stock  in connection with the acquisition 
the total acquisition costs were approximately million 
of the total purchase price  we have allocated approximately  to non compete agreements which will be amortized over a period of months  representing the terms of the agreements 
the remainder of the purchase has been allocated to customer contracts and will be amortized over a period of months  representing our current estimate of the term of the acquired client relationships 
the net acquisition costs of million are included in assets intangibles  net on our december  balance sheet 
in january  we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to register the resale of up to  shares of our common stock by island data 
our registration of the resale of the shares was required by our agreement with island data 
the shares registered for resale on the registration statement  but not actually issued to island data pursuant to the agreement  will be deregistered 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock covered by the island data registration statement 
in january  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission relating to  shares of our common stock that we may issue from time to time 
we have no immediate plans to offer or sell any shares under this shelf registration 
we presently intend to use the net proceeds from any sale of the registered shares for general corporate purposes  working capital and potential strategic acquisitions 
we would announce the terms of any issuance in a filing with the securities and exchange commission at the time we offer or sell the shares 
in july  we acquired certain identifiable assets of facetime communications  inc the transaction transferred certain existing customer contracts of facetime to us 
the purchase price was based in part on future revenue generated by us from the former facetime client base 
the total acquisition costs were approximately  including the initial purchase price payment of  to facetime 
the total acquisition cost will be amortized ratably over a period of months  representing our current estimate of the term of the acquired client relationships 
the net acquisition costs of  are included in assets intangibles  net on our december  balance sheet 
previously disclosed results of operations and financial condition on february   we disclosed our preliminary results of operations and financial condition for the quarter and year ended december  the disclosure stated that the financial audit was not yet complete as of that date  and that the financial results were subject to change following the completion of the audit 
since that date  there were two revisions to the results that impact the previously disclosed results 
management recorded additional adjusting entries  which resulted in a reduction of net income for of  we also corrected an assumption in the methodology for the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding used in diluted net income loss per common share  which increased the number of weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended december  by  the impact of these adjustments was a reduction of basic net income per share for of two tenths of a cent and a reduction of diluted net income per share for of one half of a cent  as compared to the previously disclosed amounts 
due to the convention of rounding earnings per share to the nearest penny  reported diluted net income per share for is as compared to in the previous disclosure 
the correction in methodology also affected the weighted average shares outstanding used in diluted net income per common share in the third and fourth quarters of and all quarterly periods in these corrections had no impact on reported diluted net income per common share in these periods because of the convention of rounding earnings per share to the nearest penny 
revenue our clients pay us a monthly fee  which varies by service and client usage 
certain of our larger clients  who require more sophisticated implementation and training  may also pay an initial non refundable set up fee 
our set up fee is intended to recover certain costs incurred by us principally customer service  training and other administrative costs prior to deployment of our services 
such fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over a period of months  representing the estimated term of the client relationships 
as a result of recognizing set up fees in this manner  combined with the fact that a small proportion of our clients are charged a set up fee  revenue attributable to our monthly service fee for the years ended december   and accounted for   and  respectively  of total liveperson services revenue 
in addition  because we typically do not charge a set up fee for sales generated via internet download  we expect the set up fee to continue to represent a small percentage of total revenue 
in instances where we do charge a set up fee  we typically do not charge an additional set up fee if an existing client adds more services 
our service agreements typically have no termination date and are terminable by either party upon to days notice without penalty 
we recognize monthly service revenue fees and professional service fees as services are provided 
professional service fees consist of additional training and business consulting and analysis provided to customers  both at the initial launch and over the term of the contract 
given the time required to schedule training for our clients operators and our clients resource constraints  we have historically experienced a lag between signing a client contract and generating revenue from that client 
this lag has generally ranged from one day to days 
there is no lag for sales generated via internet download  because our services are immediately available and fully functional upon download 
we also sell certain of the liveperson services directly via internet download 
these services are marketed as timpani sb for small and medium sized businesses  and are paid for almost exclusively by credit card 
credit card payments accelerate cash flow and reduce our collection risk  subject to the merchant bank s right to hold back cash pending settlement of the transactions 
sales executed via internet download may occur with or without the assistance of an online sales representative  rather than through face to face or telephone contact which is typically required for traditional direct sales 
sales of the liveperson services via internet download typically have no set up fee  because we do not provide the customer with training  and administrative costs are minimal 
we recognize monthly service revenue fees from internet downloads as services are provided 
we also have entered into contractual arrangements that complement our direct sales force and online sales efforts 
these are primarily with web hosting and call center service companies  pursuant to which liveperson is paid a commission based on revenue generated by these service companies from our referrals 
to date  revenue from such commissions has not been material 
operating expenses our cost of revenue has principally been associated with the liveperson services and has consisted of compensation costs relating to employees who provide customer service to our clients  compensation costs relating to our network support staff  allocated occupancy costs and related overhead  and the cost of supporting our infrastructure  including expenses related to server leases and internet connectivity  as well as depreciation of certain hardware and software

during  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  to approximately  principally due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased sales  and we wrote off approximately  of previously reserved accounts  leaving a net allowance of  at december  during  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  to approximately  principally due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased sales  and we wrote off approximately  of previously reserved accounts  leaving a net allowance of  at december  we base our allowance for doubtful accounts on specifically identified credit risks of customers  historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable 
we adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts when accounts previously reserved have been collected

the warrant vested such that  shares became exercisable on each monthly anniversary of the warrant issuance date for the first months of the warrant s five year term 
some or all of the purchase price may be paid by canceling a portion of the warrant 
as of december   the warrant was fully vested and remained outstanding to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
we recorded non cash compensation expense of  related to this warrant during in may  we issued a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at per share to genesis select corp 
in exchange for investor relations services 
the warrant vested such that the shares underlying the warrant could not be sold until after december  some or all of the purchase price may be paid by canceling a portion of the warrant

we recorded non cash compensation expense of  related to this warrant during restructuring in the first quarter of  following a review of our business in connection with our acquisition of the private israeli company humanclick ltd 
in october  we commenced restructuring initiatives to streamline our operations  including the consolidation of our two san francisco bay area offices 
the restructuring resulted in a reduction of our workforce by approximately people as of the end of the first quarter of in the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of approximately million for severance and other expenses related to the restructuring 
in the third quarter of  in a continued effort to streamline our operations  we initiated additional restructuring initiatives and recorded a charge of approximately million 
these initiatives resulted in the elimination of redundant staff positions  and the decision to relocate our principal executive offices  which included the termination of an office space lease and the entering into of a new three year lease that commenced in november 
the restructuring resulted in a reduction of our workforce by approximately people  the write off of impaired computer equipment and software and the write off of certain furniture  equipment and building improvements 
for the year ended december   we recorded net charges of approximately million for our various restructuring initiatives 
in connection with our third quarter restructuring initiatives  we consolidated all of our clients onto a single software application platform and network 
the new platform provided our customers with a more dependable product and reduced our cost of providing these services 
our network is hosted by a third party provider of secure server hosting services located in the united states 
while the cost of providing our services as a result of these initiatives has decreased  we are dependent on our third party server hosting provider for redundant network connections  server maintenance and general security 
we have not experienced any material product instability or operational consequences since the implementation of these initiatives 
we have also consolidated our product development  help desk and online sales personnel in our israel office 
as a result  the political  economic or military conditions affecting israel could have a material adverse effect on our operations in israel or our business 
in the fourth quarter of  in accordance with eitf  we incurred an additional restructuring charge related to our restructuring initiatives 
this million charge primarily related to the unfavorable settlement of a previously disclosed legal proceeding in excess of the provision initially provided for in connection with our original restructuring plan 
the legal proceeding was the result of the termination of an operating lease for computer equipment that supported our application platform prior to the consolidation of all clients onto a single application platform in the third quarter of in the second quarter of  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of approximately million related to our restructuring initiatives 
this charge reflected the amount of the judgment in a previously disclosed arbitration proceeding in excess of the  provision initially provided for by us in connection with our original restructuring plan in the arbitration proceeding was related to a hosted software service contract terminated during results of operations due to our acquisition of certain identifiable assets of facetime in july  our acquisition of certain identifiable assets of island data in december  our acquisition of the newchannel customer contracts and associated rights in july and our limited operating history  we believe that comparisons of our  and operating results with each other  or with those of prior periods  are not meaningful and that our historical operating results should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance

cumulative effect of accounting change 
on january   we were required to adopt the full provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
this testing requires the identification of reporting units and comparison of the reporting units carrying value to their fair value and  when appropriate  requires the reduction of the carrying value of impaired assets to their fair value 
the transitional impairment analysis required upon adoption of sfas no 
was completed during the first quarter of  and we determined that there was an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill 
as part of this analysis  we determined that we continued to operate in one operating segment and that we did not have any separate reporting units under sfas no 
 accordingly  the impairment analysis was performed on an enterprise wide basis 
this process included obtaining an independent appraisal of our fair value as a whole and of our individual assets 
the allocation of fair values to identifiable tangible and intangible assets as of january   resulted in an implied valuation of the goodwill of the implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as determining the amount of goodwill that would have been required to be recognized in a business combination 
that is  under sfas no 
 an entity is required to allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire it 
comparing this implied value to the carrying value resulted in an impairment of million  with no income tax effect

this increase is primarily attributable to increased revenue from existing clients  the addition of new clients and  to a lesser extent  to the acquisition of the island data customer contracts and associated rights in december and the acquisition of the facetime customer contracts in july our cost of revenue has generally increased in each of the last eight quarters from  to  this increase is attributable to an increase in the number of account management personnel to support both increased client activity as well as activity driven by the acquisition of the island data customer contracts and associated rights in december  increased spending for backup server facilities  increased usage from existing clients  the addition of new clients and  to a lesser extent  to the acquisition of the facetime customer contracts in july our product development costs have generally increased in each of the last eight quarters from  to  this increase is attributable to an increase in the number of liveperson product development personnel to support both the launch of a significant new release of the liveperson services under the timpani brand name and  to a lesser extent  an increase in outsourced labor costs related to the continuing development of our product line as we broaden the range of services we offer to include a fully integrated  multi channel software platform 
our sales and marketing costs have increased in each of the last eight quarters from  to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in sales and marketing personnel as a result of the expansion of our sales force  and  to a lesser extent  to an increase in on line advertising and marketing expenses related to our increasing efforts to enhance our brand recognition and to increased sales lead activity 
our general and administrative costs have generally increased in each of the last eight quarters from  to million 
this increase is primarily related to the settlement of a previously disclosed legal matter and increases in legal expenses  accounting expenses and recruitment costs related to the expansion of our sales force  as well as an increase in compensation and related expenses  partially offset by a decrease in non cash compensation expense 
amortization expense in the year ended december  relates to acquisition costs recorded as a result of our acquisitions of certain identifiable assets of island data and facetime in december and july  respectively 
amortization expense in the year ended december  relates to acquisition costs recorded as a result of our acquisition of the newchannel customer contracts and associated rights in july liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  an increase of million from december  this increase is primarily attributable to net cash provided by operating activities offset in part by net cash used in investing activities 
we regularly invest excess funds in short term money market funds 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  and consisted of net income and non cash expenses related to the amortization of intangibles  non cash compensation and depreciation offset by a decrease in accrued expenses  and increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 
net cash used in operating activities was million in the year ended december  and consisted primarily of net operating losses offset by non cash expenses related to the amortization of intangibles  non cash compensation and depreciation and to a lesser extent  to increases in accounts payable and deferred revenue partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was  in the year ended december  and was due to the acquisition of the facetime customer contracts in july and the purchase of fixed assets 
net cash used in investing activities was  in the year ended december  and was due to the acquisition of certain island data assets and the purchase of fixed assets 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in the year ended december  and was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended december  and was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees 
we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology and services  to hire employees in our customer service  sales  marketing and administration departments  and for the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets  as well as non cash compensation costs 
historically  we incurred significant quarterly net losses from inception through june   significant negative cash flows from operations in our quarterly periods from inception through december  and negative cash flows from operations of  in the three month period ended march  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these losses have been funded primarily through the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering and  prior to the initial public offering  the issuance of convertible preferred stock 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional funds prior to such time  and we would then seek to sell additional equity or debt securities through public financings  or seek alternative sources of financing 
we cannot assure you that additional funding will be available on favorable terms  when needed  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any necessary additional financing  we may be required to further reduce the scope of our planned sales and marketing and product development efforts  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we may require additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion  to develop new or enhanced services or products or to invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
contractual obligations and commitments we do not have any special purposes entities  and other than operating leases  which are described below  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we lease facilities and certain equipment under agreements accounted for as operating leases 
these leases generally require us to pay all executory costs such as maintenance and insurance 
rental expense for operating leases for the years ended december  and was approximately  and  respectively 
in october  we modified the existing lease for our principal executive offices in new york city 
the modification included the extension of the term of our current lease to october as well as the addition of new space 
as of december   our principal commitments were approximately million under various operating leases  of which approximately  is due in we do not currently expect that our principal commitments for the year ended december  will exceed  in the aggregate 
our capital expenditures are not currently expected to exceed  in our contractual obligations at december  are summarized as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases total risk factors that may affect future results risks related to our business we have a history of losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  and we may incur losses in the future 
although we have achieved profitability in each three month period since and including the period ended september   we may  in the future  incur losses and experience negative cash flow  either or both of which may be significant 
we recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  we recorded net income of million in the year ended december  as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we cannot assure you that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
failure to maintain profitability may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations  which may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors  including the following factors which are in part within our control  and in part outside of our control market acceptance by companies doing business online of real time sales  customer service and marketing solutions  our clients business success  our clients demand for our services  our ability to attract and retain clients  the amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of our operations  including those related to acquisitions  the introduction of new services by us or our competitors  and changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors 
our revenue and results may also fluctuate significantly in the future due to the following factors that are entirely outside of our control economic conditions specific to the internet  electronic commerce and online media  and general economic and political conditions 
period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful because of these factors 
you should not rely upon these comparisons as indicators of our future performance 
due to the foregoing factors  it is possible that our results of operations in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
we may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change and changing client preferences in the online sales  marketing and customer service industry and this may harm our business 
if we are unable  for technological  legal  financial or other reasons  to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions in the online sales  marketing and customer service industry or our clients or internet users requirements  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
business on the internet is characterized by rapid technological change 
in addition  the market for online sales  marketing and customer service solutions is relatively new 
sudden changes in client and internet user requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies  such as broadband communications  and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render the liveperson services and our proprietary technology and systems obsolete 
the rapid evolution of these products and services will require that we continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our services 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to enhance the features and performance of the liveperson services  develop and offer new services that are valuable to companies doing business online and internet users  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a cost effective and timely manner 
if any of our new services  including upgrades to our current services  do not meet our clients or internet users expectations  our business may be harmed 
updating our technology may require significant additional capital expenditures and could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if new services require us to grow rapidly  this could place a significant strain on our managerial  operational  technical and financial resources 
in order to manage our growth  we could be required to implement new or upgraded operating and financial systems  procedures and controls 
our failure to expand our operations in an efficient manner could cause our expenses to grow  our revenue to decline or grow more slowly than expected and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we are not competitive in the market for real time sales  customer service and marketing solutions  our business could be harmed 
the market for sales and customer service technology is intensely competitive and characterized by aggressive marketing  evolving industry standards  rapid technology developments and frequent new product introductions 
relatively few substantial barriers to entry exist in this market  other than the ability to design and build scalable software and  with respect to outsourced solution providers  the ability to design  build and manage scalable network architecture 
established or new entities may enter this market in the near future  including those that provide real time interaction online  with or without the user s request 
we compete directly with companies focused on technology that facilitates real time sales  email management  searchable knowledgebase applications and customer service interaction 
these markets remain fairly saturated with small companies that compete on price and features 
we also face significant competition from two customer service enterprise software providers  kana and rightnow technologies  which offer hosted solutions 
furthermore  many of our competitors offer a broader range of customer relationship management products and services than we currently offer 
we may be disadvantaged and our business may be harmed if companies doing business online choose real time sales  customer service and marketing solutions from such providers 
we also face potential competition from larger enterprise software companies such as oracle and siebel systems 
in addition  established technology companies  including aspect communications  avaya  genesys telecommunications laboratories  ibm and microsoft  may also leverage their existing relationships and capabilities to offer real time sales  customer service and marketing applications 
finally  we face competition from clients and potential clients that choose to provide a real time sales  customer service and marketing solution in house as well as  to a lesser extent  traditional offline customer service solutions  such as telephone call centers 
we believe that competition will increase as our current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market 
many of our larger current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  more diversified lines of products and services  and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources 
some competitors may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger  more established and better financed companies 
these competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  and make more attractive offers to businesses to induce them to use their products or services 
any delay in the general market acceptance of the real time sales  customer service and marketing solution business model would likely harm our competitive position 
delays would allow our competitors additional time to improve their service or product offerings  and would also provide time for new competitors to develop real time sales  customer service and marketing applications and solicit prospective clients within our target markets 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced operating margins and loss of market share 
the success of our business is dependent on the retention of existing clients and their purchase of additional liveperson services 
our liveperson services agreements typically have no termination date and are terminable upon to days notice without penalty 
if a significant number of our clients  or any one client to whom we provide a significant amount of services  were to terminate these services agreements  or reduce the amount of services purchased or fail to purchase additional services  our results of operations may be negatively and materially affected 
dissatisfaction with the nature or quality of our services could also lead clients to terminate our service 
we depend on monthly fees from the liveperson services for substantially all of our revenue 
if our retention rate declines  our revenue could decline unless we are able to obtain additional clients or alternate revenue sources 
further  because of the historically small amount of services sold in initial orders  we depend on sales to new clients and sales of additional services to our existing clients 
we are dependent on technology systems that are beyond our control 
the success of the liveperson services depends in part on our clients online services as well as the internet connections of visitors to their web sites  both of which are outside of our control 
as a result  it may be difficult to identify the source of problems if they occur 
in the past  we have experienced problems related to connectivity which have resulted in slower than normal response times to internet user chat requests and messages and interruptions in service 
the liveperson services rely both on the internet and on our connectivity vendors for data transmission 
therefore  even when connectivity problems are not caused by the liveperson services  our clients or internet users may attribute the problem to us 
this could diminish our brand and harm our business  divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts or cause significant client relations problems 
in addition  we rely on a third party web hosting service provider for internet connectivity and network infrastructure hosting  security and maintenance 
the provider has  in the past  experienced problems that have resulted in slower than normal response times and interruptions in service 
if we are unable to continue utilizing the services of our existing web hosting provider or if our web hosting services experience interruptions or delays  it is possible that our business could be harmed 
our service also depends on third parties for hardware and software  which products could contain defects 
problems arising from our use of such hardware or software could require us to incur significant costs or divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts 
to the extent any such problems require us to replace such hardware or software  we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms  if at all 
technological defects could disrupt our services  which could harm our business and reputation 
we face risks related to the technological capabilities of the liveperson services 
we expect the number of interactions between our clients operators and internet users over our system to increase significantly as we expand our client base 
our network hardware and software may not be able to accommodate this additional volume 
additionally  we must continually upgrade our software to improve the features and functionality of the liveperson services in order to be competitive in our market 
if future versions of our software contain undetected errors  our business could be harmed 
as a result of major software upgrades at liveperson  our client sites have  from time to time  experienced slower than normal response times and interruptions in service 
if we experience system failures or degraded response times  our reputation and brand could be harmed 
we may also experience technical problems in the process of installing and initiating the liveperson services on new web hosting services 
these problems  if unremedied  could harm our business 
the liveperson services also depend on complex software which may contain defects  particularly when we introduce new versions onto our servers 
we may not discover software defects that affect our new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed 
it is possible that  despite testing by us  defects may occur in the software 
these defects could result in damage to our reputation  lost sales  delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products  and unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 
our clients may experience adverse business conditions that could adversely affect our business 
some of our clients may experience difficulty in supporting their current operations and implementing their business plans 
these clients may reduce their spending on our services  or may not be able to discharge their payment and other obligations to us 
these circumstances are influenced by general economic and industry specific conditions  and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  as a result of these conditions  our clients  in particular our internet related clients that may experience or that anticipate experiencing difficulty raising capital  may elect to scale back the resources they devote to customer service technology  including services such as ours 
if the current environment for our clients  including  in particular  our internet related clients  does not improve  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the non payment or late payment of amounts due to us from a significant number of clients would negatively impact our financial condition 
during  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  to approximately  principally due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased sales  and we wrote off approximately  of previously reserved accounts  leaving a net allowance of  at december  during  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  to approximately  principally due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased sales  and we wrote off approximately  of previously reserved accounts  leaving a net allowance of  at december  our business is significantly dependent on our ability to retain our current key personnel  to attract new personnel  and to manage staff attrition 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management team  including robert p 
locascio  our founder and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of any member of our senior management team  in particular mr 
locascio  could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to successfully integrate newly hired senior managers who would work together successfully with our existing management team 
we may be unable to attract  integrate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
if our retention efforts are ineffective  employee turnover could increase and our ability to provide services to our clients would be materially and adversely affected 
any staff attrition we experience  whether initiated by the departing employees or by us  could place a significant strain on our managerial  operational  financial and other resources 
to the extent that we do not initiate or seek any staff attrition that occurs  there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and hire adequate replacement staff promptly  if at all  and even that if such staff is replaced  we will be successful in integrating these employees 
in addition  we may not be able to outsource certain functions 
we expect to evaluate our needs and the performance of our staff on a periodic basis  and may choose to make adjustments in the future 
if the size of our staff is significantly reduced  either by our choice or otherwise  it may become more difficult for us to manage existing  or establish new  relationships with clients and other counter parties  or to expand and improve our service offerings 
it may also become more difficult for us to implement changes to our business plan or to respond promptly to opportunities in the marketplace 
further  it may become more difficult for us to devote personnel resources necessary to maintain or improve existing systems  including our financial and managerial controls  billing systems  reporting systems and procedures 
thus  any significant amount of staff attrition could cause our business and financial results to suffer 
we cannot predict our future capital needs to execute our business strategy and we may not be able to secure additional financing 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
to the extent that we require additional funds to support our operations or the expansion of our business  or to pay for acquisitions  we may need to sell additional equity  issue debt or convertible securities or obtain credit facilities through financial institutions 
in the past  we have obtained financing principally through the sale of preferred stock  common stock and warrants 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt or preferred equity securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and could have terms that impose restrictions on our operations 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities  our stockholders could suffer dilution 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if required  will be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund any potential expansion  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance our services or products  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
those limitations would materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we do not successfully integrate potential future acquisitions  our business could be harmed 
in the future  we may acquire or invest in complementary companies  products or technologies 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to us  including difficulties in integrating operations  technologies  products and personnel with liveperson  diversion of financial and management resources from efforts related to the liveperson services or other then existing operations  risks of entering new markets beyond providing real time sales  customer service and marketing solutions for companies doing business online  potential loss of either our existing key employees or key employees of any companies we acquire  and our inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
furthermore  we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we could face additional regulatory requirements  tax liabilities and other risks as we expand internationally 
in october  we acquired humanclick  an israeli based provider of real time online customer service applications 
in addition  we are testing an outsourced sales and marketing service provider to sell the liveperson services in western europe 
there are risks related to doing business in international markets  such as changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  more stringent rules relating to the privacy of internet users and adverse tax consequences 
in addition  there are likely to be different consumer preferences and requirements in specific international markets 
furthermore  we may face difficulties in staffing and managing any foreign operations 
one or more of these factors could harm any future international operations 
our reputation depends  in part  on factors which are entirely outside of our control 
our services typically appear as a liveperson branded  timpani branded or a custom created icon on our clients web sites 
the customer service operators who respond to the inquiries of our clients internet users are employees or agents of our clients  they are not our employees 
as a result  we have no way of controlling the actions of these operators 
in addition  an internet user may not know that the operator is an employee or agent of our client  rather than a liveperson employee 
if an internet user were to have a negative experience in a liveperson powered real time dialogue  it is possible that this experience could be attributed to us  which could diminish our brand and harm our business 
finally  we believe the success of our services depend on the prominent placement of the icon on the client s web site  over which we also have no control 
our business and prospects would suffer if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights 
our success and ability to compete depend  in part  upon the protection of our intellectual property rights relating to the technology underlying the liveperson services 
it is possible that any issued patent or patents issued in the future may not be broad enough to protect our intellectual property rights  any issued patent or any patents issued in the future could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties  which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the inventions claimed in the patents  current and future competitors may independently develop similar technologies  duplicate our services or design around any patents we may have  and effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which we do business  where our services are sold or used  where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the us or where enforcement of laws protecting proprietary rights is not common or effective 
further  to the extent that the invention described in any us patent was made public prior to the filing of the patent application  we may not be able to obtain patent protection in certain foreign countries 
we also rely upon copyright  trade secret  trademark and other common law in the us and other jurisdictions  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  to protect our proprietary technology  processes and other intellectual property  to the extent that protection is sought or secured at all 
any steps we might take may not be adequate to protect against infringement and misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties 
similarly  third parties may be able to independently develop similar or superior technology  processes or other intellectual property 
policing unauthorized use of our services and intellectual property rights is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights  particularly in foreign countries where we do business  where our services are sold or used  where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states or where enforcement of laws protecting proprietary rights is not common or effective 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property rights could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it 
if this occurs  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  disputes concerning the ownership or rights to use intellectual property could be costly and time consuming to litigate  may distract management from operating our business and may result in our loss of significant rights 
our products and services may infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties and any infringement could require us to incur substantial costs and may distract our management 
we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third party proprietary rights 
substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry 
in the ordinary course of our business  our services may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of services in different industry segments overlaps 
some of our competitors in the market for real time sales  customer service and marketing may have filed or may intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology 
any claims alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights could require us to spend significant amounts in litigation even if the claim is invalid  distract management from other tasks of operating our business  pay substantial damage awards  prevent us from selling our products  delay delivery of the liveperson services  develop non infringing software  technology  business processes  systems or other intellectual property none of which might be successful  or limit our ability to use the intellectual property that is the subject of any of these claims  unless we enter into license agreements with the third parties which may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms  or not available at all 
therefore  such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be liable if third parties misappropriate personal information belonging to our clients internet users 
we maintain dialogue transcripts of the text based chats and email interactions between our clients and internet users and store on our servers information supplied voluntarily by these internet users in surveys 
we provide this information to our clients to allow them to perform internet user analyses and monitor the effectiveness of our services 
some of the information we collect may include personal information  such as contact and demographic information 
if third parties were able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate personal information relating to our clients internet users or the text of customer service inquiries  we could be subject to liability 
we could be subject to negligence claims or claims for misuse of personal information 
these claims could result in litigation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
the need to physically secure and securely transmit confidential information online has been a significant barrier to electronic commerce and online communications 
any well publicized compromise of security could deter people from using online services such as the ones we offer  or from using them to conduct transactions  which involve transmitting confidential information 
because our success depends on the general acceptance of our services and electronic commerce  we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
political  economic and military conditions in israel could negatively impact our israeli operations 
our product development staff  help desk and online sales personnel are located in israel 
as of december   we had full time employees in israel and as of december   we had full time employees in israel 
although substantially all of our sales to date have been made to customers outside israel  we are directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors 
a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has caused security and economic problems in israel 
further  since september  there has been a significant deterioration in the relationship between israel and the palestinian authority and serious violence has ensued  the peace process between the parties has stagnated  and israel s relationship with several arab countries has been adversely affected 
moreover  hostilities during  and escalated significantly  with increased attacks in israel and an armed conflict between israel and the palestinians in the west bank and gaza 
efforts to resolve the conflict have failed to result in an agreeable solution 
continued hostilities between the palestinian community and israel and any failure to settle the conflict could adversely affect our operations in israel and our business 
further deterioration of the situation into a full scale armed conflict might require more widespread military reserve service by some of our israeli employees and might result in a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in israel and our business 
in addition  several arab countries still restrict business with israeli companies 
our operations in israel could be adversely affected by restrictive laws or policies directed towards israel and israeli businesses 
risks related to our industry we are dependent on the continued use of the internet as a medium for commerce 
we cannot be sure that a sufficiently broad base of consumers will continue to use the internet as a medium for commerce 
convincing our clients to offer real time sales  customer service and marketing technology may be difficult 
the continuation of the internet as a viable commercial marketplace is subject to a number of factors  including continued growth in the number of users  concerns about transaction security  continued development of the necessary technological infrastructure  development of enabling technologies  uncertain and increasing government regulation  and the development of complementary services and products 
we depend on the continued viability of the infrastructure of the internet 
to the extent that the internet continues to experience growth in the number of users and frequency of use by consumers resulting in increased bandwidth demands  we cannot assure you that the infrastructure for the internet will be able to support the demands placed upon it 
the internet has experienced outages and delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure 
outages or delays could adversely affect online sites  email and the level of traffic on the internet 
we also depend on internet service providers that provide our clients and internet users with access to the liveperson services 
in the past  users have experienced difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our service 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity 
insufficient availability of telecommunications services to support the internet also could result in slower response times and negatively impact use of the internet generally  and our clients sites including the liveperson dialogue windows in particular 
if the use of the internet fails to grow or grows more slowly than expected  if the infrastructure for the internet does not effectively support growth that may occur or if the internet does not become a viable commercial marketplace  we may not maintain profitability and our business  results of operations and financial condition will suffer 
we may become subject to burdensome government regulation and legal uncertainties 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulation  and laws of jurisdictions outside of the united states  including laws and regulations applicable to computer software and access to or commerce over the internet 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet and various other online services  it is likely that a number of new laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering issues such as user privacy  freedom of expression  pricing  content and quality of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights and information security 
the nature of such legislation and the manner in which it may be interpreted and enforced cannot be fully determined and  therefore  such legislation could subject us and or our clients or internet users to potential liability  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of collecting data from live online internet user dialogues  our clients may be able to analyze the commercial habits of internet users 
privacy concerns may cause internet users to avoid online sites that collect such behavioral information and even the perception of security and privacy concerns  whether or not valid  may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our services 
in addition  we or our clients may be harmed by any laws or regulations that restrict the ability to collect or use this data 
the european union and many countries within the eu have adopted privacy directives or laws that strictly regulate the collection and use of personally identifiable information of internet users 
the united states has adopted legislation which governs the collection and use of certain personal information 
the us federal trade commission has also taken action against web site operators who do not comply with their stated privacy policies 
furthermore  other foreign jurisdictions have adopted legislation governing the collection and use of personal information 
these and other governmental efforts may limit our clients ability to collect and use information about their internet users through our services
