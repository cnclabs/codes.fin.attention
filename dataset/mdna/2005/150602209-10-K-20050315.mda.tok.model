item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
executive summary the company is a fully integrated  self administered and self managed real estate company 
at december   the company had a portfolio of properties totaling approximately million square feet of gla  including wholly owned properties comprising approximately million square feet and six properties owned through joint ventures comprising approximately  square feet 
the portfolio  excluding properties currently under development and or redevelopment  was approximately leased as of that date 
the company  organized as a maryland corporation  has established an umbrella partnership structure through the contribution of substantially all of its assets to the operating partnership 
at december   the company owned approximately of the operating partnership and is its sole general partner  in addition  the company conducts all of its business through the operating partnership 
op units are economically equivalent to the company s common stock and are convertible into the company s common stock at the option of the holders on a one to one basis 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from rents and operating expense reimbursements received pursuant to long term leases 
the company s operating results therefore depend on the ability of its tenants to make the payments required by the terms of their leases 
the company focuses its investment activities on community and neighborhood shopping centers  anchored principally by regional supermarket chains 
the company believes  because of the need of consumers to purchase food and other staple goods and services generally available at supermarket anchored shopping centers  that the nature of its investments provide for relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times 
the company continues to seek opportunistic acquisition opportunities of stabilized properties  and properties suited for development and or redevelopment activities where it can utilize its experience in shopping center renovation  expansion  re leasing and re merchandising to achieve long term cash flow growth and favorable investment returns 
the company would also consider investment opportunities in markets beyond the pennsylvania  connecticut  maryland  massachusetts and new jersey areas in the event 
back to contents such opportunities were consistent with its focus  could be effectively controlled and managed by it  have the potential for favorable investment returns  and contribute to increased shareholder value 
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  real estate investments and purchase price allocations related thereto  asset impairment  and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risks 
these accounting policies are further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management s estimates are based on information that is currently available and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates and those estimates could be different under varying assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the following critical accounting policies  the application of which requires significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition rental income with scheduled rent increases is recognized using the straight line method over the respective terms of the leases 
the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over base rents under applicable lease provisions is included in rents and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheet 
leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred 
in addition  certain operating leases contain contingent rent provisions under which tenants are required to pay a percentage of their sales in excess of a specified amount as additional rent 
the company defers recognition of contingent rental income until those specified targets are met 
the company must make estimates as to the collectibility of its accounts receivable related to base rent  straight line rent  expense reimbursements and other revenues 
management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant creditworthiness  current economic trends  and changes in tenants payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on net income  because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income 
real estate investments real estate investments are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the provision for depreciation is calculated using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets 
expenditures for maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not materially prolong the normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred 
expenditures for betterments that substantially extend the useful lives of the properties are capitalized 
the company is required to make subjective estimates as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis 
these assessments have a direct impact on net income 
a shorter estimate of the useful life of an investment would have the effect of increasing depreciation expense and lowering net income  whereas a longer estimate of the useful life of the investment would have the effect of reducing depreciation expense and increasing net income

 goodwill and other intangibles  in valuing real estate acquisitions 
in connection therewith  the fair value of real estate acquired is allocated to land  building and building improvements 
the fair value of in place leases  consisting primarily of below market rents is allocated to intangible lease liabilities 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land  building and building improvements based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets 
management determines the as if vacant value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses  and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on its evaluation of current market demand 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases  including leasing commissions  tenant improvements  legal and other related costs 
the value of in place leases is measured by the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in place leases to market rental rates  over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant 
above market and below market in place lease values are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between the contractual amounts to be received and management s estimate of market lease rates  measured over the non cancelable terms 
this aggregate value is allocated among above market and below market leases  tenant relationships  and other intangibles based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each lease 
the value of other intangibles is amortized to expense  and the above market and below market lease values are amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be immediately recognized in operations 
the company applies sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to recognize and measure impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews each real estate investment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a real estate investment may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future cash flows that are expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if an impairment event exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair market value 
real estate investments held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value  less cost to sell 
depreciation and amortization are suspended during the period held for sale 
management is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on net income  because an impairment loss is recognized in the period that the assessment is made 
hedging activities from time to time  the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
derivative instruments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at their 
back to contents estimated fair values 
any change in the value of a derivative is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  whereas the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in operations 
if interest rate assumptions and other factors used to estimate a derivative s fair value or methodologies used to determine a derivative s effectiveness were different  amounts included in the determination of net income or accumulated other comprehensive income loss could be affected

back to contents liquidity and capital resources the company funds operating expenses and other short term liquidity requirements  including debt service  tenant improvements  leasing commissions  and preferred and common dividend distributions  primarily from operating cash flows  if needed  the company may also use its secured revolving credit facility for these purposes 
the company expects to fund long term liquidity requirements for property acquisitions  development and or redevelopment costs  capital improvements  and maturing debt initially with the secured revolving credit facility and ultimately through a combination of issuing additional mortgage debt and the sale of equity securities 
during  the company sold  shares of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a price of per share and realized approximately million after underwriting fees and offering costs  and  shares of its common stock at a price of per share and realized approximately million after underwriting fees and offering costs 
the net proceeds from both offerings were initially used to reduce the company s secured revolving credit facility

in january as amended in november  the company concluded a three year million expandable to million  subject to certain conditions being met syndicated secured revolving credit facility with bank of america formerly fleet national bank and several other banks  with bank of america as agent  pursuant to which the company pledged certain of its shopping center properties as collateral for borrowings thereunder 
as of december   based on covenants and collateral in place  the company was permitted to draw the entire million  of which approximately million remained available as of that date 
in january  the banks commitments were increased from million to million  and the company was permitted to draw approximately million 
the company plans to add additional properties to the collateral pool with the intent to make the full facility available 
borrowings under the facility presently bear interest at a rate of libor plus basis points bps  a total rate of as of december   and are subject to increases to a maximum of bps depending upon the company s leverage ratio  as defined 
the credit facility may be used to fund acquisitions  development and redevelopment activities  capital expenditures  mortgage repayments  dividend distributions  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the facility is subject to customary financial covenants  including limits on leverage and other financial statement ratios 
in february  the company received a commitment for approximately million in construction financing for its camp hill mall redevelopment property  which provides for the repayment of the million in original acquisition financing  as well as funding for substantially all the projected redevelopment costs at the property 
the facility will bear interest at bps over libor and mature in three years 
at december   the company s financial liquidity was provided by million in cash and cash equivalents and by the million availability under the secured revolving credit facility 
in addition  mortgage loans payable at december  consisted of fixed rate notes totaling million and floating rate debt totaling million  with a combined weighted average interest rate of  and maturing at various dates through portions of the company s assets are owned through joint venture partnership arrangements which require  among other things  that the company maintain separate cash accounts for the operations of the respective properties 
in addition  the terms of certain of the company s mortgage agreements require it to deposit replacement and other reserves with its lenders 
these joint venture and reserve accounts are 
back to contents separately classified on the company s balance sheet as restricted cash  and are available for the specific purpose for which they were established  they are not available to fund other company obligations 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth the company s significant debt repayment and operating lease obligations at december  in thousands maturity date thereafter total mortgage loans payable secured revolving credit facility operating lease obligations total in addition  as of december   the company had planned to spend approximately million in connection with its development and redevelopment activities 
net cash flows operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to million during  compared to cash flows used in operating activities of million during  and cash flows provided by operating activities of million during the change in operating cash flows was primarily due to net operating results generated from property acquisitions 
the change in operating cash flows was primarily due to transactions associated with the public offering  including debt defeasance costs  the cost of interim financing associated with property acquisitions  and the cost above par value to redeem the preferred op units 
such cash flows were offset  in part  by net operating results generated from property acquisitions 
during  the change in cash flows from operating activities was primarily the result of net operating results generated by property acquisitions 
investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities were million in  million in  and million in these increases were the result of an active acquisition program 
during  the company acquired five shopping centers  three redevelopment properties  one development property  and land for future expansion  during  the company acquired twelve shopping centers and two redevelopment properties  and during  the company acquired two shopping centers  one redevelopment property  and one development property 
during  the company sold one property for net proceeds of million 
financing activities net cash flows provided by financing activities were million in  million in  and million in during  the company received million in net proceeds from public offerings  million in net proceeds from the company s secured revolving credit facility  million in net proceeds from mortgage financings  and million realized from the termination of interest rate hedges  offset by the repayment of mortgage obligations of million  preferred and common stock distributions of million  the payment of financing  leasing and other costs of million  and distributions paid to 
back to contents minority and limited partner interests of million 
during  the company received million net proceeds from a public offering  million net proceeds from mortgage financings  million in net proceeds from the company s secured revolving credit facility and interim financings  and million of capital contributions from  net of distributions to  minority interest partners  offset by million in redemptions of op units  the repayment of mortgage obligations of million  the payment of financing  leasing and other costs of million  and preferred distribution requirements of million 
during  the company received million in mortgage financings  million of capital contributions from  net of distributions to  minority interest partners  and million from the issuance of preferred op units  offset by the payment of financing  leasing and other costs of million  and the repayment of mortgage obligations of million funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo to be a relevant and meaningful supplemental measure of the company s performance because it is predicated on a cash flow analysis  contrasted with net income  a measure predicated on gaap  which gives effect to non cash items such as depreciation and amortization 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the white paper on ffo published by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which defines ffo as income before allocation to minority interests computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after preferred distribution requirements and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are computed to reflect ffo on the same basis 
in computing ffo  the company does not add back to net income the amortization of costs incurred in connection with its financing or hedging activities  or depreciation of non real estate assets  but does add back to net income those items that are defined as extraordinary under gaap 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
since the nareit white paper only provides guidelines for computing ffo  the computation of ffo may vary from one company to another 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs 
the following table sets forth the company s calculations of ffo for the years ended december   and net income loss add deduct depreciation and amortization limited partners interest preferred distribution requirements loss on sale of property minority interests minority interests share of ffo funds from used in operations ffo per common share op unit outstanding average number of common shares op units outstanding assumes conversion of op units 
back to contents inflation low to moderate levels of inflation during the past several years have favorably impacted the company s operations by stabilizing operating expenses 
at the same time  low inflation has had the indirect effect of reducing the company s ability to increase tenant rents 
however  the company s properties have tenants whose leases include expense reimbursements and other provisions to minimize the effect of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk facing the company is interest rate risk on its mortgage loans payable and secured revolving credit facility 
the company will  when advantageous  hedge its interest rate risk using derivative financial instruments 
the company is not subject to foreign currency risk 
the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily through i the secured floating rate revolving credit facility used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures and expand its real estate investment portfolio  and ii floating rate acquisition and construction financing 
the company s interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on operations and cash flows  and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  the company may borrow at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and or treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related variable rate financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is managed using a variety of techniques 
at december   long term debt consisted of fixed and variable rate mortgage loans payable  and the variable rate secured revolving credit facility 
the average interest rate on the million of fixed rate indebtedness outstanding was  with maturities at various dates through the average interest rate on the company s million of variable rate debt was  with maturities at various dates through at december   the company s pro rata share of variable rate debt amounted to million 
based upon this amount  if interest rates either increase or decrease by  the company s net income would decrease or increase respectively by approximately  per annum
