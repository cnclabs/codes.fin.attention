back to contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the largest providers of healthcare and support services to the elderly in the united states 
within our network of geographically concentrated facilities  we offer services focusing on the primary medical  physical and behavioral issues facing the medically complex elderly population 
we are focused on qualitative and quantitative clinical performance measures in order to enhance and improve continuously the care provided in our facilities 
through our physicians  nurses  therapists and other members of our interdisciplinary medical care team  we apply a comprehensive approach to the complex needs facing the elderly  which we believe has resulted in our above industry average occupancy levels and an enhanced level of medicare and private paying patients 
we receive higher rates of reimbursement from medicare and private paying patients 
for the twelve months ended september   the average occupancy level in our inpatient facilities was approximately and approximately of our net revenues were from medicare and private paying patients 
approximately of our net revenues are generated through our inpatient services segment 
our inpatient services business is offered through a network of skilled nursing and assisted living centers primarily located in the eastern united states 
our eldercare centers are concentrated in the states of pennsylvania  new jersey  maryland and massachusetts 
we currently own  lease  manage or jointly own eldercare facilities  consisting of skilled nursing facilities  assisted living facilities and transitional care units together totaling  beds 
our rehabilitation therapy segment  which represents approximately of our net revenues  provides an extensive range of rehabilitation therapy services to the elderly  including speech pathology  physical therapy and occupational therapy in our eldercare regional market concentrations 
these services are provided by approximately  licensed rehabilitation therapists and assistants employed or contracted by us at substantially all of the eldercare facilities we operate  as well as by contract to third party healthcare facilities operated by other providers and through our outpatient rehabilitation agencies 
we also provide other complementary healthcare services  the revenues for which are included in all other services revenues in our segment financial information 
the aging of the population and increased life expectancies are the primary driving forces behind the growth of our businesses 
we believe that positive demographic trends imply that there will be a growing demand for the services offered by healthcare providers that deliver the most efficient  responsive  cost effective and high quality eldercare services 
we are continually engaged in various efforts to improve our profitability by focusing on key operational initiatives  including modernizing our physical plant and information systems  improving the level of medicare and private paying patients  increasing our rate of occupancy  improving nursing staff scheduling and retention  reducing reliance on overtime compensation and temporary agency services  and capitalizing on best demonstrated practices in various areas of cost control 
as a result  we believe we will be well positioned to take advantage of the favorable demographic and growth trends in our industry 
government funded programs  principally medicaid and medicare  provide approximately of our revenue 
over the past five years  changes in funding from these government sources has had a significant impact on our cash flows and profitability 
through trade and other organizations  we actively participate in partnership with other healthcare providers to pursue strategies to minimize any potentially adverse impact of government funding proposals 
we believe the continuation of government funding at levels sufficient to operate our business profitably is our greatest financial risk 
labor costs  including salaries  wages and benefits  account for approximately of our total operating expenses 
we compete with other healthcare providers and with non healthcare providers for both professional and non professional employees 
in recent years  we and our industry have experienced shortages in qualified professional clinical staff 
while in our inpatient services segment we have been able to retain the services of an adequate number of qualified personnel to staff our facilities and sites of services  we have used expensive 
back to contents temporary nursing agency services to supplement staffing 
if a shortage of nurses or other health care workers occurred in the geographic areas in which we operate  it could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and could further increase our operating costs  without a corresponding increase in the level of government funded reimbursement 
beginning in fiscal and throughout fiscal  we and the rehabilitation therapy services sector are experiencing a shortage of qualified rehabilitation therapists 
as the demand for these services continues to exceed the supply of available therapists  we and our competitors have been forced to offer more attractive wage and benefit packages to these professionals while utilizing outside contractors for these services at premium rates 
due to intense competition for customers  and through september   we were unable to pass the increase in therapist labor costs along to our customers in the form of price increases 
although we have been able to retain adequate levels of qualified therapists to maintain our standards of quality care in the services we provide  the shortage of qualified therapists has impacted negatively our profitability and our ability to generate new therapy business 
we are implementing certain initiatives in fiscal intended to improve our therapist recruitment and retention capabilities while also being more aggressive in pricing our services and more selective in our external customer base 
these initiatives  along with the implementation of a more efficient and integrated time collection system to improve the productivity of our therapist workforce are intended to improve the profitability of this business

back to contents revenue sources we receive revenues from medicare  medicaid  private insurance  self pay residents and other third party payors 
our rehabilitation therapy services and other service related businesses also receive revenues from long term care facilities that utilize our services 
the following table reflects the payor mix of inpatient service revenues for the periods presented  and has been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations year ended september  medicaid medicare private pay and other growth in the percentage of our medicaid revenues is attributed to the recognition of provider assessments  which are accompanied by an increase in operating costs in the form of a provider tax 
the sources and amounts of our revenues are determined by a number of factors  including licensed bed capacity and occupancy rates of our eldercare centers  the mix of patients and the rates of reimbursement among payors 
likewise  payment for ancillary medical services  including services provided by our rehabilitation therapy services business  vary based upon the type of payor and payment methodologies 
changes in these and other factors can significantly affect our profitability 
on july   cms published notice of the fiscal year prospective payment system rates that became effective october  and which were in effect through september  the fiscal year rules provided for a increase in the annual inflation update factor and continue the current payment system with certain payment add ons that were authorized to compensate for non therapy ancillaries 
on july   cms released the final fiscal skilled nursing facility prospective payment rules  including refinement to the resource utilization group rug classification system rugs refinement 
effective october   the current skilled nursing facility prospective payment rates were increased by a annual inflation update factor 
effective january   the rules establish nine new payment classifications  alter the case mix weights for the remaining rug payment categories and adjust upward the nursing component of most rug payment categories 
excluding the additional annual inflation factor  and after considering the distribution of our medicare patient population under the new system  rugs refinement is expected to reduce our medicare payment rates approximately per patient day beginning january   thereby reducing fiscal revenue and ebitda approximately million and reducing net income approximately million 
the proposed federal budget for also proposes to reduce by the amount that medicare reimburses skilled nursing facilities and other non hospital providers for bad debts arising from uncollectible medicare coinsurance and deductibles 
as proposed by cms  the reduction would be phased in over a three year period at per year 
based on our current volume of medicare coinsurance bad debts  this proposed rule would reduce our ebitda and net income by million and million in the first year  respectively 
we cannot currently determine if  or when  this proposal will be implemented 
the medicare modernization act mma  enacted on december   created a new medicare prescription drug benefit  created incentives for greater private competition within medicare  adjusted coverage and payment terms for a number of providers and part b prescription drugs and reformed the administration of the medicare benefit 
the mma may have an impact on institutional pharmacy services provided in the long term setting 
the law constitutes a significant overhaul of the medicare system  including provisions to provide subsidies to insurers and managed care organizations  and establishes mechanisms to allow private healthcare coverage plans to compete with medicare initially on a pilot basis 

back to contents the mma suspended application of  payment caps therapy caps on medicare part b rehabilitation through december  the therapy caps in place effective september  imposed payment limits to services provided by independent therapists as well as to those provided by outpatient rehabilitation facilities and other forms of rehabilitation agencies 
extension of the moratorium on application of the therapy caps removed a significant financial threat to our therapy business for the short term 
cms recently announced in its publication of the final physician fee schedules the implementation of the therapy caps effective january  the therapy caps will be increased to  while efforts have been made to introduce legislation in congress to extend the moratorium  congress has not approved this extension 
no assurances can be made or given that congress will extend the moratorium on application of the therapy caps beyond calendar year as mandated by the law  the general accounting office is conducting a study of alternatives to the therapy caps 
we are unable to predict the impact an implementation of therapy caps would have on our financial condition and operating results  but believe it has the potential to reduce our revenue  ebitda and net income 
effective january   under the mma  medicaid coverage of prescription drugs for medicare beneficiaries who are also eligible for medicaid will be shifted to the medicare program medicare part d 
these residents are referred to as dual eligibles 
this change could affect a significant percentage of residents in our nursing facilities 
as a result of shifting prescription drug coverage from medicaid to medicare through such private plans  the mma could affect the ability of long term care pharmacies to provide pharmacy service to our residents 
cms announced final regulations relating to the mma on january   and provided specific sub regulatory guidance for long term care on march  the final regulations specifically require the new prescription drug plans and medicare advantage plans that offer prescription drug coverage to provide convenient access to long term care pharmacies and to offer standard contracts to all long term care pharmacies within the plans service areas that meet performance standards to be specified by cms 
currently  under contract  omnicare  inc  through its wholly owned subsidiary  provides services required by federal law for residents of our facilities and are reimbursed primarily through the medicaid program 
we do not yet know whether payment rates for the prescription drugs provided by these plans will be sufficient to cover the costs of the pharmacy needs of nursing home residents 
thus  there is a risk that the implementation of the mma may disrupt pharmacy services to our facilities 
we have a special operating task force in place to help facilities with the transition to the new medicare part d benefit 
any such change or reduction in long term care pharmacy services could create additional cost for us  reduce our ability to meet quality standards and disrupt service delivery to our residents 
moreover  the mma covers most prescription drugs  insulin and certain insulin supplies  and approved vaccines 
however  certain drugs are excluded from coverage under the new medicare benefit in part d  including several drugs that are commonly prescribed for nursing home and other long term care residents 
as a result  there is a risk that if these prescription drug costs are not reimbursed under medicaid or through medicare  we will need to bear the cost of these drugs 
we have described only certain provisions of the mma applicable to our business 
there may be other provisions of the legislation that may impact our business by decreasing revenues or increasing operational expenses 
the impact of this legislation depends upon a variety of factors  including patient mix and the implementing regulations 
cms continues to issue new regulations to implement the mma  which we are in the process of reviewing 
however  because of the broad scope and phased implementation of key provisions in the mma  we are not in a position to assess fully its impact on our business 
by law  medicare reimbursement for physician and non physician professional services including medicare part b physical therapy  speech pathology and occupational therapy services are based on fee schedules 
cms has published final payment rules for calendar year unless congress intervenes  cms will impose a reduction in average payments for all professional services effective january  the us senate has passed legislation substituting a positive increase in favor of the reduction 
it remains uncertain whether congress will finalize action in time to prevent the payment reductions 
although we are unable to predict the outcome of these measures  a reduction in payment for professional services would have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
state budget pressures in recent years have translated into reductions in the rate of state spending growth in certain jurisdictions 
given that medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets  we expect continuing cost containment pressures on medicaid outlays for skilled nursing facilities in the states in which we 
back to contents operate 
in each of the major states where we provide services  we are working with trade groups  consultants and government officials to address responsibly the particular funding issues 
the plight of state governments has helped to elevate issues related to medicaid onto the national agenda 
in  congress passed temporary relief to states providing a increase in the federal medicaid assistance percentage for five quarters estimated to provide states billion in medicaid relief 
that assistance terminated on june  actions to date on state medicaid budgets affirm that many states are adjusting downward the rate of growth in state medicaid spending to reflect the loss of the temporary federal assistance 
medicaid funding is set annually 
most states have completed legislative actions on their fiscal year state budgets 
we expect our average medicaid rate per patient day to increase between approximately to in our fiscal among the alternative medicaid funding approaches that states have explored  and in many states implemented  are nursing home provider assessments as tools for leveraging increased medicaid matching funds 
such initiatives are authorized under the law 
provider assessment plans generate additional federal matching funds to the states for medicaid reimbursement purposes  and implementation of a provider assessment plan requires approval by cms in order to qualify for federal matching funds 
these plans usually take the form of a bed tax or a quality assessment fee  which is imposed uniformly across classes of providers within the state 
in turn  the state generally utilizes the additional federal matching funds generated by the tax to pay increased reimbursement rates to the providers  which often include a repayment of a portion of the provider tax based on the provider s percentage of medicaid patients 
nursing home provider assessments have been implemented in eight states where we operate massachusetts  west virginia  rhode island  north carolina  new hampshire  pennsylvania  new jersey and connecticut 
three of these plans received federal approval during this fiscal year 
in january  cms approved the pennsylvania provider assessment 
the pennsylvania provider assessment  which was retroactive to july  and will expire on june   was recognized cumulatively in the quarter ended march  recognition of the pennsylvania provider assessment resulted in increased revenue  ebitda and net income of million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal  of which million of revenue  million of ebitda and million of net income relates to periods prior to the current fiscal year 
in february  cms approved the new jersey provider assessment 
the new jersey provider assessment  which was retroactive to july  and will expire on june   was recognized cumulatively in the quarter ended march  recognition of the new jersey provider assessment resulted in increased revenue  ebitda and net income of million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal  of which million of revenue  million of ebitda and million of net income relates to periods prior to the current fiscal year 
the connecticut provider assessment  which was retroactive to july   was recognized in the quarter ended september  recognition of the connecticut provider assessment resulted in increased revenue  ebitda and net income of million  million and million  respectively  all of which relates to the quarter ended september  the commonwealth of pennsylvania has proposed a reduction in the reimbursement allowance under its provider assessment program effective july  through june  if the proposed reduction is made final as expected  the amount we must pay the commonwealth under this program will exceed the amount we are reimbursed 
in the quarter ended september   our revenue and ebitda were reduced million  and our net income was reduced million or per diluted share to consider the reduced reimbursement 
if the proposed reduction is made final as expected  our fiscal revenue and ebitda would be reduced approximately million  and our net income would be reduced approximately million or per diluted share 
we believe this adjustment is unique to the methodology used by the commonwealth in implementing its medicaid provider assessment plan 
the commonwealth has indicated that provider assessment payments made for fiscal years through were based on lower than actual medicaid utilization 
adjustments in the reimbursement allowance are meant to correct faulty assumptions underlying payment amounts for the prior two years 
the proposed federal budget for included proposed reform of the medicaid program to cut a total of billion in projected medicaid expenditure growth over years  including a provision that would reduce the maximum amount of provider taxes that a state may impose on providers for purposes of qualifying for federal matching funds from of a state s medicaid outlay to 
congress  during consideration of its fiscal year first congressional budget resolution  scaled back the proposed medicaid reductions 
the final enactment is a compromise establishing a medicaid commission authorized to make specific policy recommendations  while agreeing to defer medicaid cuts during fiscal year  and providing reconciliation instructions to congress to make billion in medicaid reductions during fiscal years to congress has not agreed upon the proposed medicaid reduction and it remains unclear as to whether these budget issues will be resolved 
back to contents by the end of no predictions can be made as to the ultimate outcome of this budget proposal or the future of provider tax plan provisions 
we cannot predict the extent of the impact that such decrease  if any  in spending by the federal government will have on our financial condition and results of operations 
it is not possible to quantify fully the effect of legislative changes  the interpretation or administration of such legislation or other governmental initiatives on our business and the business of the customers served by our rehabilitation services business 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the impact of any future healthcare legislation or regulation will not further adversely affect our business 
there can be no assurance that payments under governmental and private third party payor programs will be timely  will remain at levels similar to present levels or will  in the future  be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to such programs 
our financial condition and results of operations will be affected by the reimbursement process  which in the healthcare industry is complex and can involve lengthy delays between the time that revenue is recognized and the time that reimbursement amounts are settled 
the federal government and state governments continue to focus on efforts to curb spending on healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid 
it is impossible to predict the outcome of the legislative and regulatory processes 
we cannot at this time predict the extent to which these proposals will be adopted or  if adopted and implemented  what effect  if any  such proposals and existing new legislation and regulation will have on us 
efforts to impose reduced allowances  greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue 
results of operations factors affecting comparability of financial information our consolidated statements of operations for the twelve months ended september  and for the first two months through november  of the twelve months ended september  have been prepared on a basis which reflects our historical financial statements assuming that the operations of nci contributed in the spin off were organized as a separate legal entity which owned certain net assets of nci 
the allocation methodology followed in preparing the financial statements prior to the december  spin off may not necessarily reflect what the results of operations  cash flows or financial position would have been had we been a separate stand alone public entity for such periods 
management believes that the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended september  and are generally comparable to the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended september   with the exception of interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense 
this lack of comparability is due to the restructuring of our capital following the spin off and the related incremental interest costs and amortization of deferred financing fees in connection with our new financing arrangements 
also  in fiscal  we reevaluated the classification of certain of our leases and determined that five center leases previously classified as operating leases beginning in fiscal should have been classified as capital leases 
the cumulative effect of correcting this accounting in fiscal is an increase to depreciation expense of million of which million relates to fiscal  an increase to interest expense of million of which million relates to fiscal and a decrease to lease expense of million of which million relates to fiscal  having no impact on pre tax or net income 
the capitalization of these leases also had the effect of increasing total assets and total liabilities principally debt million 
reasons for non gaap financial information the following discussion includes ebitda and adjusted ebitda which are non gaap financial measures 
for purposes of sec regulation g  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant s historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the most directly comparable financial 
back to contents measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of operations  balance sheet or statement of cash flows or equivalent statements of the registrant  or includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the most directly comparable financial measure so calculated and presented 
in this regard  gaap refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
pursuant to the requirements of regulation g  we have provided reconciliations of the non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
management believes that the presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because they are useful for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business 
we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda primarily as performance measures and believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda is net income 
we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a measure to assess the relative performance of our eldercare properties and other of our operating businesses  as well as the employees responsible for operating such businesses 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful in this regard because they do not include such costs as interest expense  income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense which may vary from business unit to business unit depending upon such factors as the method used to finance the original purchase of the business unit or the tax law in the state that a business unit operates in 
by excluding such factors when measuring financial performance  many of which are outside of the control of the employees responsible for operating our business units  management is better able to evaluate operating performance of the business unit and the employees responsible for business unit performance 
consequently  management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda to determine the extent to which our employees have met performance goals  and therefore may or may not be eligible for incentive compensation awards 
we also use ebitda and adjusted ebitda in our annual budget process 
we believe ebitda and adjusted ebitda facilitate internal comparisons to historical operating performance of prior periods and external comparisons to competitors historical operating performance 
although we use ebitda as a financial measure to assess the performance of our business  the use of ebitda is limited because it does not consider certain material costs necessary to operate our business 
these costs include the cost to service our debt  the non cash depreciation and amortization associated with our long lived assets  the cost of our federal and state tax obligations  our share of the earnings or losses of our less than owned operations and the operating results of our discontinued businesses 
because ebitda does not consider these important elements of our cost structure  a user of our financial information who relies on ebitda as the only measure of our performance could draw an incomplete or misleading conclusion regarding our financial performance 
consequently  a user of our financial information should consider net income an important measure of our financial performance because it provides the most complete measure of our performance 
we define ebitda as earnings from continuing operations before equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates  minority interests  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
other companies may define ebitda differently and  as a result  our measure of ebitda may not be directly comparable to ebitda of other companies 
ebitda does not represent net income  as defined by gaap 
adjusted ebitda is presented to exclude certain expenses and gains related to one time transactional events or settlements 
specifically  in fiscal we excluded a net gain recognized in connection with the early extinguishment of a mortgage debt 
adjusted ebitda is presented because management uses this information in evaluating the continuing operations of our business and believes that this information provides investors a useful insight into our operating results 
management also believes that excluding such expenses and gains properly reflects our ongoing operations and provides better comparability to prior year results 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to  not as substitutes for  or superior to  gaap financial measures 

back to contents reconciliation of net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda year ended september  in thousands net income    add back loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates   minority interests income tax expense    interest expense    depreciation and amortization expense    ebitda    gain on early extinguishment of debt  adjusted ebitda    the gain on early extinguishment of debt is the result of a negotiated discount on a mortgage loan liquidated by us at the request of the mortgage lender 
we excluded this gain on early extinguishment of debt from the calculation of adjusted ebitda because management does not view such a gain as likely to occur in the foreseeable future  nor have we encountered a similar transaction in recent years 
while we often may be interested in extinguishing certain of our mortgage loans by refinancing such loans at more favorable rates of interest  because most of these mortgage loans require expensive prepayment penalties  it often is not economically feasible for us to do so 
to have a mortgage lender approach us to extinguish mortgage debt so that we are able to negotiate favorable extinguishment terms is deemed by management to be an unusual event that is reasonably unlikely to occur within the next two years 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal revenues were  million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
of this growth  inpatient services revenue increased by million  external rehabilitation therapy services revenue increased by million and external other businesses revenue increased by million 
the million of revenue growth in our inpatient services segment is primarily attributed to increased payor rates and acquisitions 
in aggregate  payor rates increased by million versus the prior year with million of such increase occurring in the medicaid payor category  of which million was due to provider tax assessments for new jersey  pennsylvania  new hampshire and connecticut  with million of such provider tax assessments pertaining to prior years 
the prior year period contained no provider tax assessments for new jersey  pennsylvania or connecticut 
medicaid revenue settlements and adjustments increased by million versus the prior year period 
the million balance of medicaid rate increases  which equate to a increase  resulted from both increased acuity levels and legislative increases 
a increase in our average medicare rate  attributed to the october  upward medicare rate adjustments of and higher medicare patient acuity  was the primary reason for the remainder of the overall rate increase 
approximately million of the overall revenue increase is due to the step acquisition of three eldercare centers  which we previously jointly owned and managed 
we purchased our joint venture partners ownership interests in the centers and currently we own and consolidate of the operations 
higher medicare part b volume resulted in million of increased revenues 
remaining net revenue increases of million were primarily due to increased quality mix resulting from combined insurance and medicare census comprising more of our skilled nursing facility census in the current year to date period versus the prior year to date period 
the preceding were partially offset by a million revenue decline as the result of the current year period having one less day than the same period in the prior leap year and an million revenue decline resulting from a decline in overall occupancy 
overall occupancy 
back to contents declined to in the current year period from in the same period in the prior year 
total patient days increased  to  in the current year period compared to  in the same period of the prior year 
a  patient day increase attributed to the step acquisitions of three eldercare centers was offset by a decline of  patient days as the result of the current year having one less day than the prior year and a  patient day decline in our same facility centers which were included in both reporting periods 
increased revenue volume generated by ongoing customer contracts was the primary reason for the million or increase in external rehabilitation therapy services revenue 
the million increase in external other business revenue primarily resulted from million of increased volume in our respiratory therapy business and million of net increases primarily due to increased management fee revenues and increased investment income resulting from increased cash levels 
the preceding was partially offset by million of decreased external business volume in our non core hospitality  physician services and staffing services businesses 
fiscal net income increased to million from million in the same period in the prior year 
revenue increases of million  as previously discussed  were partially offset by million of increased salaries  wages and benefits and million of higher other operating expenses 
of the million of increased salaries  wages and benefits  million is attributed to the step acquisitions of three eldercare centers  approximately million is attributed to the replacement of higher cost temporary agency nurses with internally employed nurses  with the balance of the increase due to normal inflationary growth in wage and benefits in both our inpatient services segment and rehabilitation therapy services segment  increased inpatient nursing hours per patient day resulting from servicing higher acuity patients and increased rehabilitation therapy services business volume 
of the million of increased other operating expenses  million is attributed to increased provider assessments primarily for new jersey  pennsylvania and connecticut  with million of such provider assessments pertaining to periods prior to fiscal  million is attributed to increased utilization of temporary agencies within our rehabilitation services business as a result of an industry wide shortage of therapists  million is attributed to an increase in pharmacy  medical supply and other ancillary costs incurred to treat a higher acuity patient population  million is attributed to step acquisitions of three eldercare centers  million is attributed to increased general and professional liability insurance and million is attributed to increased training costs associated with employee safety programs 
an additional million of increased operating expenses is due to an adjustment to reflect an estimate of previously unaccrued costs resulting from a weakness in our purchasing cut off procedures 
we have remediated the internal control weakness and believe that the correction is not material to any previously reported financial statements or earnings trends 
these increases in other operating expenses were offset by approximately million of reduced costs attributed to the replacement of higher cost temporary agency nurses with internally employed nurses 
the balance of the increase in other operating expenses of approximately million is largely attributed to normal inflationary increases in cost 
general and administrative costs increased by million with million of the increase attributed to higher adverse claims development associated with our self insured programs  million attributed to increased strategic consulting costs  million attributed to consulting costs incurred relative to matters associated with the sarbanes oxley act  million attributed to support costs relative to the implementation of new inpatient data systems with the balance of the increase primarily resulting from inflationary increases in payroll costs and increased support staff 
the million decrease in the provision for losses on accounts receivable and notes receivable is primarily due to improvement in the collection of older accounts receivable 
net income was further reduced from increases in early extinguishment of debt costs  depreciation and amortization expense  interest expense and income tax expense as further discussed below 
net income increased due to lower lease expense  lower after tax losses of discontinued operations and higher earnings of less than owned subsidiaries  each of which is further discussed below 
for fiscal  ebitda increased million to million compared with million in the same period of the prior year 
inpatient services ebitda increased million  of which million is due to provider tax assessments for new jersey  pennsylvania  connecticut and new hampshire  with million of such provider tax assessments pertaining to periods prior to fiscal increased medicaid revenue settlements and adjustments are responsible for million of the increase 
approximately million of the increase is due to step acquisitions of three eldercare centers and million is due to decreased lease expense  which is further described below  with the remaining million increase resulting from the previously discussed other increases 
back to contents in payor rates  increased quality mix  reduced utilization of external nursing agencies and reduced bad debt expense offset by the impact of decreased occupancy and inflationary increases in cost 
ebitda of our rehabilitation therapy services segment declined million with million of combined external and intersegment revenue increases being offset by million of higher labor related costs  million of increased utilization of temporary agencies  a million impairment charge to write off the investment related to an abandoned rehabilitation services application system and million of increased other costs 
the increase in rehabilitation therapy labor and temporary agency costs is primarily being driven by high market demand for a limited pool of qualified therapists 
increased loss on early extinguishment of debt in the current year to date period decreased ebitda by million 
of the million loss on early extinguishment of debt recognized in fiscal  million is due to the write off of unamortized financing fees for several repaid mortgages  million is due to the full write off of unamortized financing fees for the term loan component of our senior credit facility and million is due to the write off of unamortized financing fees from the repurchase of our senior subordinated notes 
in addition  prepayment premiums on the repurchased senior subordinated notes resulted in million of debt extinguishment charges 
the remaining decrease in ebitda of million in fiscal in all other services and corporate costs resulted principally from million of increased strategic consulting costs  million of consulting costs incurred relative to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and million of support costs relative to the implementation of new inpatient data systems 
capital costs and other lease expense decreased by million to million in fiscal  compared to million for the same period in the prior year  primarily due to a million reduction of expense resulting from the reclassification of certain of our leases from operating leases to capital leases  partially offset by a million increase to expense resulting from a correction to recognize operating lease expense on a straight line basis 
the balance of the decline is due to the purchase of six previously leased facilities  offset by inflationary increases in lease costs 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million to million in fiscal compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase is principally attributed to million of additional depreciation expense resulting from the reclassification of certain of our leases from operating leases to capital leases  million of corrections to depreciation expense recorded in the current year following modifications to the useful lives assigned to certain fixed assets  with the remaining million attributed to additional depreciation expense on incremental capital additions 
interest expense increased by million to million in fiscal compared to million for the same period in the prior year  primarily due to million of interest expense recorded as a result of the reclassification of certain of our leases from operating leases to capital leases 
the preceding was offset by the restructuring of our debt portfolio in the march quarter and resulting decline in overall debt and our weighted average interest rate 
income tax expense in fiscal is estimated using an effective tax rate of approximately  offset by the recognition of million of tax credits  a million tax refund and a million adjustment to our income tax liability following the filing of our fiscal tax return 
income tax in the prior year was estimated using an effective tax rate of 
the increase in the effective tax rate is attributed to higher permanent deductions principally in the area of lobbying expenses 
income tax expense includes the provision of taxes on both equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates and minority interests 
loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  was million in fiscal and million in the prior year to date period 
the change is primarily due to the relative results of operations of those businesses identified as discontinued operations 
operating results of our less than owned subsidiaries in the fiscal improved compared to the same period in the prior year  resulting in a combined increase of million in equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates and minority interests 

back to contents fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal revenues were  million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
of this growth  inpatient services revenue increased by million  external rehabilitation therapy services revenue grew million and external other businesses revenue declined million 
the million of revenue growth in our inpatient services segment is primarily attributed to increased payor rates and acquisitions 
of the total increase in inpatient services revenue  million is due to step acquisitions of eight eldercare centers  which we previously managed 
we purchased our joint venture partners ownership interests in these eight centers and now own of the operations 
as a result  the revenues and expenses of these centers are included in more periods in our current fiscal year results than in the prior fiscal year 
the balance of the increase in inpatient services revenue is primarily due to increased average rates per patient day 
our average rate per patient day in the current fiscal year was compared to for the prior year 
this increase in the average rate per patient day is principally driven by increased average medicaid rates in versus in and medicare rates per patient day in versus in 
of the million of medicaid rate increases  million resulted from the first time recognition of provider assessment revenue for our new hampshire centers 
the increase in our medicare rate per patient day is attributed to the october  upward medicare rate adjustments of and higher medicare patient acuity 
total patient days increased  to  in the current year compared to  in the prior year 
of this increase   patient days are attributed to the step acquisition of eight eldercare centers discussed above  and  are attributed to the current year having one additional calendar day due to a leap year 
the remaining decline of  patient days is attributed to a decline in the occupancy of our same facility centers which were included in both reporting periods 
our overall occupancy declined to in from in external rehabilitation therapy services revenue increased by million  or 
rehabilitation revenue increases of million from newly signed contracts and million from increased sales volume from existing customer contracts were partially offset by million of lost business and million of decreases in rates charged to existing external customers 
management s decision to curtail the operations of our hospitality services business led to a million decline in external other business revenue  with the million balance of the decline in other business revenue primarily resulting from reduced management fee revenue due to the step acquisitions of the eight previously managed properties discussed above 
fiscal net income increased to million from million in the same period in the prior year 
revenue increases of million  as discussed above  were partially offset by million of increased salaries  wages and benefits and million of increased other operating expenses 
of the million of increased salaries  wages and benefits  million is attributed to the step acquisition of the eight eldercare centers  approximately million is attributed to the replacement of higher cost temporary agency nurses with internally employed nurses  with the balance of the increase due to both normal inflationary growth in wage and benefits in our inpatient services segment and disproportionate growth in wage and benefit costs of our rehabilitation therapy services segment 
the million increase in other operating expenses was primarily the net result of approximately million of reduced costs attributed to the replacement of higher cost temporary agency nurses with internally employed nurses being offset by million resulting from the recognition of new hampshire provider assessment taxes with the balance of the change primarily due to the step acquisition of the eight eldercare centers 
the million increase in general and administrative costs resulted primarily from the incremental costs of our operating independently of nci and general inflationary increases in costs 
improvement in the collection of aged accounts receivable resulted in a million reduction in the provision for losses on accounts receivable and notes receivable 
net income was further reduced from increases in lease expense  interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense and loss gain on early extinguishment and income tax expense as further discussed below 
net income increased due to lower after tax losses of discontinued operations and higher earnings of less than owned subsidiaries  each of which is further discussed below 
for fiscal  adjusted ebitda was million compared with million in same period of the prior year 
increased adjusted ebitda in the current fiscal year reflects a million increase in the adjusted 
back to contents ebitda of our inpatient services segment due to million of price reductions extended by our rehabilitation therapy services segment to our inpatient services segment  and million due to the step acquisition of eight eldercare centers 
the remaining million adjusted ebitda increase in the inpatient services segment is primarily the result of the previously discussed increase in payor rates and provider assessments  reduced utilization of external nursing agencies and improved pricing for drugs and medical supplies as a result of our post spin off pricing arrangements  offset by inflationary increases in cost 
the inpatient services increase in adjusted ebitda was offset by a decrease of million in the adjusted ebitda of our rehabilitation therapy services segment primarily due to certain contract pricing reductions  including the million of price reductions extended to our inpatient services segment  and million of higher labor related costs 
the increase in rehabilitation therapy labor costs is being driven by high market demand for a limited pool of qualified therapists 
increased loss on early extinguishment of debt in the current year decreased adjusted ebitda by million 
the remaining decrease in adjusted ebitda of million in fiscal is principally attributed to increased general and administrative costs driven by inflationary increases in cost and the incremental cost of operating independently of nci 
capital costs and other lease expense increased by million to million in fiscal from million in the prior year period primarily due to the step acquisitions of three eldercare centers subject to leases 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million in fiscal compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
the increase is principally attributed to incremental amortization of deferred financing fees following the completion of our new financing arrangements and incremental depreciation expense on information systems following the spin off 
incremental depreciation expense on information systems is due to higher levels of such systems attributed to us from nci in excess of estimated allocations made in the prior year carve out financial statements 
interest expense increased million in fiscal to million  compared to million for the same period in the prior year  principally due to increased debt levels above those allocated in the prior year carve out financial statements resulting from the october issuance of our senior subordinated notes in an aggregate principal amount of million and  in december of  our entering into a senior credit facility consisting of a fully drawn million term loan 
the loss on early extinguishment of debt recognized in fiscal is the result of the early extinguishment of mortgage loans as well as the unscheduled voluntary prepayments of million of the term loan component of our senior credit facility and principally consists of the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees 
the gain on early extinguishment of debt recognized in the prior year is the result of a negotiated discount on a mortgage loan liquidated by us at the request of the mortgage lender 
loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  was million in fiscal and million for the same period in the prior year 
the change is due in part to a million after tax write down of assets classified as discontinued in fiscal compared to million after tax recorded in the prior year period  combined with the relative results of operations of those businesses identified as discontinued operations 
the improvement in the operating results of our discontinued businesses is primarily due to our disposition of certain discontinued operations since the prior year  including the sale of our discontinued florida properties in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year 
income tax expense in fiscal was recorded at an effective tax rate of 
income tax expense in fiscal was offset by the utilization of million of tax losses pursuant to the job creation and worker assistance act of income tax expense in fiscal was otherwise estimated using an effective tax rate of approximately 
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal reflects a reduction in employment tax credits due  in large part  to enactment of the working families tax relief act on october  since the law was enacted after our fiscal year end  we could not reflect the benefit of provisions which retroactively extended the credits for wages paid or incurred for eligible new hires in fiscal income tax expense includes the provision of taxes on both equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates and minority interests 

back to contents operating results of our less than owned subsidiaries in fiscal improved compared to the same period in the prior year  resulting in a combined increase of million in equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates and minority interests 
liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash flows reference to our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows will facilitate understanding of the discussion that follows 
our operating cash flow has been used to finance trade accounts receivable  fund capital expenditures  service and repurchase our indebtedness and make selective acquisitions 
financing trade accounts receivable is necessary because  on average  the customers and payors for our services do not pay us as quickly as we pay our vendors and employees for their services 
our cash flow from operations for fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
the million decline in cash flow from operations in fiscal primarily resulted from million in accounts receivable growth and million from the timing of payments to vendors and employees 
the remaining million improvement in operating cash flow primarily resulted from growth in operations 
our investing activities principally consist of capital expenditures and asset acquisitions and dispositions 
capital expenditures consist primarily of betterments and expansion of eldercare centers and investments in computer hardware and software 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to incur capital expenditure costs at levels significantly above the levels incurred in prior years as we intend to increase our investment in both physical plant and information systems 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscals  and  respectively 
for fiscal  capital expenditures are anticipated to be within the range of million to million 
investing activities in fiscals and also include proceeds received from the sale of eldercare centers of million and million  respectively  principally from the sale of eldercare centers located in the state of wisconsin 
proceeds from eldercare center asset sales of million in fiscal are principally attributed to sales in the states of florida and illinois 
we do not expect to receive significant cash proceeds from asset sales in fiscal in fiscal  million of net cash was used principally to purchase two previously leased skilled nursing facilities  and in fiscal  million of cash was used to purchase two centers in which we previously held a joint venture interest  to purchase five previously leased eldercare centers and to restructure nine lease agreements in an effort to reduce future lease payments 
investing activities in fiscals  and also include million  million and million  respectively  of net purchases of restricted marketable securities held by our wholly owned insurance captive 
cash flows from financing activities in fiscal are reflective of a significant number of financing transactions that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal in march  we issued million of convertible senior subordinated debentures due after paying financing fees of approximately million  we used i approximately million of the net proceeds of the offering to repurchase shares of our common stock from the initial purchasers of the debentures in negotiated transactions concurrently with the offering  ii approximately million of the net proceeds to repay the remaining outstanding borrowings under the term loan portion of our senior credit facility  and iii the balance for general corporate purposes  including repurchases of our senior subordinated notes due through september   we repurchased million of our senior subordinated notes due the debt repurchases resulted in a prepayment premium of million  which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt 
also impacting cash from net financing activities  in november  we repaid approximately million under the mandatory payment provisions of our then existing term loan under our senior credit facility 
in november  we prepaid an million  fixed rate mortgage and paid the lender a million prepayment penalty 
in january  we repaid a million mortgage that was assumed in the same period upon the step acquisition of a skilled nursing facility joint venture partnership 
cash from financing activities in fiscal was a net source of cash of million  attributed to million of net proceeds from our post spin off financing arrangements  offset by the use of million to repay indebtedness of nci  million to repay mortgage and bond debt of eight eldercare centers  million of 
back to contents voluntary prepayment of the term loan portion of our senior credit facility  million of scheduled principal payments and million of cash transferred to nci prior to and in connection with the spin off 
we continually evaluate the most efficient use of our capital  including investments in our property and equipment  information systems  potential asset acquisitions or dispositions  purchasing  refinancing  exchanging or retiring certain of our outstanding debt securities to the extent permitted by our existing covenant restrictions 
as part of such ongoing evaluation  our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock as well as certain principal amounts of our senior subordinated notes in accordance with the restrictions of our amended and restated senior credit agreement through december  share and debt repurchases may take place at management s discretion and or under pre established  nondiscretionary programs from time to time  depending on market conditions  in the open market  and in privately negotiated transactions 
through september   there were  shares of common stock repurchased at a cost of million and million of senior subordinated note repurchases 
subsequent to september   we repurchased an additional  shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
we believe that the net cash provided by our operating activities  supplemented as necessary with cash reserves and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility described below will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital requirements  debt service and other short term and long term liquidity needs 
at september   we had restricted investments in marketable securities of million  which are held by lhc  our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary incorporated under the laws of bermuda 
the investments held by lhc are restricted by statutory capital requirements in bermuda 
as a result of such restrictions and encumbrances  we and lhc are precluded from freely transferring funds through intercompany loans  advances or cash dividends 
recent financing arrangements convertible senior subordinated debentures 
in march  we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated debentures due to qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act  as amended 
interest is payable semi annually in march and september 
each of our subsidiaries that guarantee the indebtedness under the senior subordinated notes also guarantees the convertible senior subordinated debentures 
the guarantees will be released at such time that such subsidiary ceases to be a guarantor under the senior subordinated notes  all of the senior subordinated notes are no longer outstanding  or on march  in july  we registered with the sec the resale of the convertible senior subordinated debentures and the relating guarantees and underlying common stock 
the debentures may be converted into cash and  depending on the circumstances at the time of conversion  shares of our common stock 
the initial conversion rate for the debentures will be equivalent to shares of common stock per  principal amount of the debentures which is based upon an initial conversion price equivalent to approximately per share  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
the holders of the convertible senior subordinated debentures may convert their debentures into shares of our common stock prior to the stated maturity at their option only under the following circumstances if  after june   the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business days immediately following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of debentures for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate then in effect  subject to certain exceptions  the debentures have been called for redemption  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  or upon the occurrence of certain designated events 
subject to certain exceptions  once debentures are tendered for conversion  the value  or conversion value  of the cash and shares of our common stock  if any  to be received by a holder converting  principal amount of the debentures will be determined by multiplying the applicable conversion rate by the ten trading day average closing price of our common stock 
we will deliver the conversion value to holders as follows i an amount in 
back to contents cash  referred to as the principal return  equal to the lesser of x the aggregate conversion value of the debentures to be converted and y the aggregate principal amount of the debentures to be converted  ii if the aggregate conversion value of the debentures to be converted is greater than the principal return  an amount in whole shares  referred to as the net shares  equal to such aggregate conversion value less the principal return  referred to as the net share amount  and iii an amount in cash in lieu of any fractional shares of our common stock

the dilutive effect of the common shares that would be issued if the convertible debentures were converted is not included in our diluted weighted average common share balance unless the weighted average market price of our common stock during a reporting period exceeds per share 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior subordinated debentures  we have agreed with the nasdaq stock market  inc not to take certain actions without prior shareholder approval if  as a result of such actions  greater than of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of the debentures would be issued 
amendment to senior credit facility 
in connection with the offering of the convertible senior subordinated debentures  we entered into an amended and restated senior credit agreement pursuant to which we refinanced the indebtedness under our existing senior credit agreement

each of our material us subsidiaries provided guarantees of the indebtedness under the amended and restated senior credit agreement 
we and the guarantors pledged substantially all of our personal property to secure the obligations under the amended and restated senior credit agreement  subject to certain exceptions agreed upon with the lenders 
in addition  the mortgages that we and our subsidiaries provided under the prior credit agreement continue to secure the amended and restated senior credit agreement  but we are not required to provide additional mortgages except under certain limited circumstances

initially  that margin was for base rate loans and for libor loans 
the margin is adjusted from time to time  depending on our leverage ratio  as defined 
for base rate loans  the margin range is from to 
for libor loans  the margin range is from to 
at september   the margin on base rate loans was and the margin on libor loans was 
we originally paid a commitment fee to the lenders on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility equal to of the unused amount  that percentage has dropped to due to our total leverage ratio dropping below  as defined

under that arrangement  the property s owner is responsible for funding working capital needs up to million and we would be required to cover deficits in excess of that limit 
to date  we have not had to perform under that agreement 
credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if the affiliate companies were unable to repay any amounts utilized under the working capital lines of credit 
commitments to extend credit to third parties are conditional agreements generally having fixed expiration or termination dates and specific interest rates and purposes 

back to contents we have posted million of outstanding letters of credit 
the letters of credit guarantee performance to third parties of various trade activities 
the letters of credit are not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet unless they are probable of being utilized by the third party 
the financial risk approximates the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
we are a party to joint venture partnerships whereby our ownership interests are or less of the total capital of the partnerships 
we account for these partnerships using the equity method of accounting and  therefore  the assets  liabilities and operating results of these partnerships are not consolidated with ours

management assesses the creditworthiness of such partnerships in the same manner it does other third parties 
we have provided million of financial guarantees related to loan commitments of one jointly owned and managed company 
the guarantees are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet unless we are required to perform under the guarantee 
credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counter parties failed to perform completely as contracted 
the credit risk amounts are equal to the contractual amounts  assuming that the amounts are fully advanced and that no amounts could be recovered from other parties 
critical accounting policies we consider an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
our critical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant  and changes to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require revision 
application of the critical accounting policies requires management s significant judgments  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
we believe that the following represents our critical accounting policies 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  including critical accounting policies  see
