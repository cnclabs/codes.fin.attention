table of contents major railcar manufacturers in the north american market 
for the year ended december   we shipped approximately  railcars in north america  or approximately of total north american shipments 
our north american order backlog as of december  was approximately  railcars  or approximately of the total north american backlog as estimated by the railway supply institute  inc trinity rail gmbh is one of the leading freight railcar manufacturers in europe with its primary operation located in romania 
we entered the european railcar manufacturing business in with our acquisition of a large government owned romanian railcar manufacturer 
immediately after the acquisition  we initiated a multi step program designed to substantially upgrade and improve the infrastructure of the facility 
in addition  we installed new state of the art railcar manufacturing tooling and equipment and began transferring our best practices 
following our merger with thrall  which also had european facilities  we initiated a consolidation program and continued the transfer of best practices from the combined companies 
in europe  we compete against a number of manufacturers in various countries 
for the year ended december   trinity rail gmbh shipped approximately  units

however  we believe our current european market share is approximately 
our european backlog as of december  was approximately  railcars 
we hold patents of varying duration for use in our manufacture of railcar and component products 
we believe patents offer a marketing advantage in certain circumstances 
no material revenues are received from licensing of these patents 
railcar leasing and management services group 
through our wholly owned subsidiaries  primarily trinity industries leasing company tilc  we lease both tank cars and freight cars 
our railcar leasing and management services group leasing group is a premier provider of leasing and management services and is an important strategic resource that uniquely links our rail group with our customers

table of contents aggregates are mostly other concrete manufacturers  paving contractors and other consumers of aggregates 
we compete with ready mix concrete producers and aggregate producers located in the regions where we operate 
in highway safety products we are the only full line producer of guardrails  crash cushions and other protective barriers that absorb and dissipate the force of impact in collisions between vehicles and fixed roadside objects 
we believe we are the largest highway guardrail manufacturer in the united states  based on revenues  with a comprehensive nationwide guardrail supply network 
our predominantly galvanized steel product lines use the principles of momentum transfer and kinetic energy absorption to decelerate errant vehicles 
the federal highway administration determines which products are eligible for federal funds for highway projects and has approved most of our products as acceptable permanent and construction zone highway hardware according to requirements of the national cooperation highway research program 
our crash cushions and other protective barriers include multiple proprietary products manufactured through various product license agreements with certain public and private research organizations and inventors 
we hold patents and are a licensee for certain of our guardrail and end treatment products that enhance our competitive position for these products 
we sell highway safety products in all us states  canada  and mexico 
we have also recently started to export our highway safety proprietary products to certain other countries 
we compete against several national and regional guardrail producers 
we manufacture structural steel beams and girders for the construction of new  restored and or replacement railroad bridges  county  municipal and state highway bridges and power generation plants

we manufacture a variety of dry cargo barges  such as deck barges  and open or covered hopper barges that transport various commodities  such as grain  coal and aggregates 
we also produce tank barges used to transport liquid products 
fiberglass reinforced lift covers are primarily for grain and rolling covers are for other bulk commodities 
our six manufacturing facilities are located along the united states inland river system allowing for rapid delivery to our customers 
our primary inland barge customers are commercial marine transportation companies 
many companies have the capability to enter into  and from time to time do enter into  the inland barge manufacturing business 
we strive to compete through efficiency in operations and quality of product 
industrial products group 
we are a leading producer of tank containers and tank heads for pressure vessels 
we manufacture tanks in the united states  mexico and brazil 
we market a portion of our industrial products in mexico under the brand name of tatsa 
we manufacture propane tanks that are used by industrial plants  utilities  small businesses and in suburban and rural areas

table of contents many of our finished products 
we manufacture the tank heads in various shapes  and we produce pressure rated or non pressure rated tank heads  depending on their intended use 
we use a significant portion of the tank heads we manufacture in the production of our tank cars and containers 
we also sell our tank heads to a broad range of other manufacturers 
competition for tank heads in recent years has been intense and has resulted in sharply reduced prices for these products 
all other 
all other includes our captive insurance and transportation companies  structural towers  costs associated with non operating plants and other peripheral businesses 
foreign operations 
trinity s foreign operations are in brazil  the czech republic  mexico  romania  slovakia  and the united kingdom 
sales to foreign customers  primarily in europe and mexico  represented  and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december    and  we had approximately   and of our long lived assets located outside the united states 
we manufacture railcars  propane tank containers and tank heads at our mexico facilities for export to the united states 
any material change in the quotas  regulations  or duties on imports imposed by the united states government and its agencies or on exports imposed by the government of mexico or its agencies could adversely affect our operations in mexico 
our foreign activities are also subject to various other risks of doing business in foreign countries  including currency fluctuations  political changes  changes in laws and regulations and economic instability 
although our operations have not been materially affected by any of such factors to date  any substantial disruption of business as it is currently conducted could adversely affect our operations at least in the short term 
backlog 
as of december   our backlog for new railcars was  million and was million for inland barge products 
included in the railcar backlog are million of railcars to be sold to our railcar leasing and management services group 
substantially our entire backlog is expected to be delivered in the months ending december  the rail group has a multi year sales agreement for  new railcars per year for and which will not be included in the backlog until the type of car and price have been determined 
as of december   our backlog for new railcars was million and was million for inland barge products 
included in the railcar backlog was million of railcars to be sold to our railcar leasing and management services group 
marketing 
we sell substantially all of our products through our own sales personnel operating from offices in the following states and foreign countries arkansas  arizona  connecticut  florida  georgia  illinois  kentucky  louisiana  ohio  oklahoma  pennsylvania  tennessee  texas  utah  washington  brazil  canada  czech republic  france  mexico  romania  slovakia  switzerland and the united kingdom 
we also use independent sales representatives to a limited extent 
except in the case of weld fittings  guardrail and standard size propane tank containers  we ordinarily fabricate our products to our customers specifications contained in a purchase order 
raw materials and suppliers 
railcar specialty components 
products manufactured at our railcar manufacturing facilities require a significant supply of raw materials such as steel as well as numerous specialty components such as brakes  wheels and axles 
specialty components purchased from third parties comprise approximately of the production cost of each railcar 
although the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years  at least three suppliers continue to produce most components 
aggregates 
aggregates can be found throughout the united states  and many producers exist nationwide 
however  as a general rule  shipments from an individual quarry are limited in geographic scope because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the value of the product itself 
we operate mining facilities strategically located in texas  oklahoma  and louisiana to fulfill some of our needs for aggregates 
we have not experienced difficulty fulfilling the rest of our needs from local suppliers 
cement 
the worldwide demand for cement has increased over the last several years 
the supply of cement for the concrete aggregates 
table of contents business is received primarily from texas and overseas 
the increased demand  coupled with rising transportation costs  has driven the cost of this raw material up over in the last year 
although rising cost continues to impact our business  we have not experienced difficulties supplying concrete to our customers 
steel 
the principal material used in our rail  inland barge and industrial products groups is steel 
during  the prices of steel and other components we purchased increased significantly and have been volatile on a month to month basis 
fixed price sales contracts  primarily in our rail and inland barge groups  did not provide for pass through of these cost increases to customers and operating margins suffered as a result 
at december   approximately of the railcar backlog is either covered by escalation clauses or other arrangements which reduce the exposure to future material cost increases related to those contracts 
availability of steel and components was also an issue during in general  we believe there is enough capacity to meet current production levels in the supply industry 
we believe our existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts 
however  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain would have an impact on both our margin and production schedules 
employees 
the following table presents the breakdown of employees by business group december  business group rail group construction products group inland barge group industrial products group railcar leasing and management services group all other corporate as of december   approximately  employees were employed in the united states 
acquisitions 
in  we had an acquisition in the construction products group with a purchase price of million 
during  we had six acquisitions primarily in the construction products group with a combined purchase price  net of cash acquired  of million 
the acquired operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective dates of the acquisitions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters 
we are subject to comprehensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment  the management  use  processing  handling  storage  transport or disposal of hazardous and non hazardous waste and materials  or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own negligent acts  but also may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken 
in addition  such laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance  and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations 
civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with these environmental laws and regulations 
our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law 
environmental operating permits are  or may be  required for our operations under these laws and regulations 
these operating permits are subject to modification  renewal and revocation 
we regularly monitor and review our operations  procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations 
despite these compliance efforts  risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 
we believe that our operations and facilities owned  managed  or leased  are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
however  future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies  or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards associated with our products  business activities  or properties  may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 

table of contents in addition to environmental laws  the transportation of commodities by railcar or barge raises potential risks in the event of a derailment  spill or other accident 
generally  liability under existing law in the united states for a derailment  spill or other accident depends on the negligence of the party  such as the railroad  the shipper or the manufacturer of the barge  railcar or its components 
however  under certain circumstances strict liability concepts may apply 
governmental regulation railcar industry 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the railcar industry are the environmental protection agency  the research and special programs administration  a division of the department of transportation  the federal railroad administration  a division of the department of transportation  and the association of american railroads 
these organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry  including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars and railcar parts  mechanical  maintenance and related standards for railcars  safety of railroad equipment  tracks and operations  and packaging and transportation of hazardous materials 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these regulations 
we cannot predict whether any future changes in these rules and regulations could cause added compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations 
inland barge industry 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the barge industry are the united states coast guard  the national transportation safety board  the united states customs service  the maritime administration of the united states department of transportation  and private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these organizations establish safety criteria  investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
violations of these regulations and related laws can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations 
we cannot predict whether future changes that affect compliance costs would have a material adverse effect on financial conditions and operations 
highway safety products 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of our highway safety products business are the united states department of transportation  the federal highway administration and various state highway departments 
these organizations establish certain standards and specifications related to the manufacture of our highway safety products 
if our products were found not to be in compliance with these standards and specifications we would be required to re qualify our products for installation on state and national highways 
we believe that our highway safety products are in substantial compliance with all applicable standards and specifications 
we cannot predict whether future changes in these standards and specifications would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
occupational safety and health administration and similar regulations 
our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the united states occupational safety and health administration 
we believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities 
however  claims may be asserted against us for work related illnesses or injury  and our operations may be adversely affected by the further adoption of occupational health and safety regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
while we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in substantial compliance with health and safety laws and regulations  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  that such costs would not be material to us 
other matters 
to date  we have not suffered any material shortages with respect to obtaining sufficient energy supplies to operate our 
table of contents various plant facilities or transportation vehicles 
future limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products  particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles  could have an adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business 
the likelihood of such an occurrence or its duration  and its ultimate effect on our operations  cannot be reasonably predicted at this time

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary operations trinity industries  inc is a diversified industrial company providing a variety of products and services for the transportation  industrial and construction sectors of the marketplace 
we operate in five distinct business groups which we report on a segment basis the rail group  construction products group  inland barge group  industrial products group and railcar leasing and management services group leasing group 
we also report all other which includes our smaller peripheral businesses 
we operate in cyclical industries 
in we continued to witness the increase in industrial activity and signs of improvement in the manufacturing sector that we began seeing in we continued to assess our manufacturing capacity and take steps to adjust our production facilities in line with the nature of the demand 
the improvement in industrial and manufacturing activity is reflected in the increase in our new railcar orders and industry wide 
we ended with a significantly higher backlog in our rail group with an approximate  railcar increase year over year 
in addition  improvement in the rail industry was seen in our leasing group  where leasing revenues in increased by  fueled by sales from the lease fleet  growth in the size of the lease fleet  and improvement in fleet utilization 
global insight  an independent industry research firm  has estimated that us carload traffic will grow in  in  and to per year through increasing rail traffic should spark another key driver of new car demand  the need to improve productivity and efficiency through the replacement of older  smaller  inefficient units 
according to global insight  the average age of the north american freight car fleet is approximately years  with over older than years 
we believe each of these factors will be key drivers of increased railcar sales over the next few years 
global insight has estimated railcar deliveries for the industry to increase by approximately  units in to approximately  units  approximately  in and approximately  units per year for to help finance and manage our production and delivery of railcars  we use our captive financing subsidiary  trinity industries leasing company tilc 
tilc purchases a portion of our railcar production  financing a portion of the purchase price through a non recourse warehouse lending facility and refinancing those borrowings through sale leaseback and other leveraged lease or equipment trust financing transactions 
as expected  as external demand for our railcars increased our intersegment railcar production as a percentage of our total sales declined 
in  tilc purchases represented approximately of our north american railcar production  down from in on a segment basis  our rail group recognizes revenue at the time of the intersegment sale to tilc and this revenue and the related profit is eliminated in consolidation 
steel the principal material used in our rail  inland barge and industrial products groups is steel 
during  the prices of steel and other components we purchased increased significantly and have been volatile on a month to month basis 
fixed price sales contracts  primarily in our rail and inland barge groups  did not provide for pass through of these cost increases to customers and operating margins suffered as a result 
at december   approximately of the railcar backlog is either covered by escalation clauses or other arrangements which reduce the exposure to future material cost increases related to those contracts 
availability of steel and components was also an issue during in general  we believe there is enough capacity to meet current production levels in the supply industry 
we believe our existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts 
however  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain would have an impact on both our margin and production schedules 
financing activity in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount senior notes senior notes due  through a private offering 
the senior notes rank equally with all of our existing and future senior debt but are subordinated to all our existing and future secured debt to the 
table of contents extent of the value of the assets securing such debt 
the senior notes could restrict our ability to incur additional debt  make certain distributions  investments and other restricted payments  create certain liens  merge  consolidate  or sell substantially all or a portion of our assets 
we applied approximately million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay all indebtedness under our existing bank credit facility 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in connection with the issuance of our senior notes  we extended our secured credit agreement to provide for a three year  million revolving credit facility and repaid the existing term loan facility 
our accounts receivable and inventory secure the agreement 
the agreement limits the amount of capital expenditures related to our leasing business  requires maintenance of ratios related to interest coverage for the leasing and manufacturing operations  leverage  asset coverage and minimum net worth  and restricts the amount of dividend payments which based upon our current credit rating are not to exceed million annually 
tilc  through a wholly owned and consolidated business trust  renewed a million non recourse warehouse facility to finance or refinance railcars acquired or owned by tilc 
specific railcars and the underlying leases secure the facility 
advances under the facility may not exceed of the fair market value of the eligible railcars securing the facility as defined by the agreement 
during the year ended december   the leasing group completed a transaction whereby million of railcars were sold to independent trusts 
these trusts financed the purchase of the railcars with million in debt and million in third party equity 
the equity participants in the trusts are the primary beneficiaries of the trusts 
the leasing group  through a newly formed  wholly owned qualified subsidiary  leased railcars from the trusts under operating leases with terms of years and subleased the railcars to independent third parties under shorter term operating leases 
trinity does not guarantee the performance of the subsidiary s lease obligations 
under the terms of the operating lease agreement  the leasing group has options to purchase at a predetermined fixed price  certain of the railcars from the trusts in the leasing group also has options to purchase the railcars at the end of the lease agreement at the then fair market value of the railcars as determined by a third party  independent appraisal 
at the expiration of the operating lease agreement  the leasing group s qualified subsidiary has no further obligation

revenues 
revenues increased million to  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  revenues increased in every segment of our business in the increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in outside sales by the rail group 
the increase in revenues for the construction products group was the result of increased market demand in the highway safety and fittings businesses and the acquisitions made by concrete and aggregates during the later part of and early the increased revenue from the railcar leasing and management services group resulted from an increase in the size of the fleet  an improvement in utilization and a slight increase in sales from the lease fleet

generally  improved pricing and volumes in the construction products  industrial products and railcar leasing and management services groups partially offset the impact of material cost increases in the rail and inland barge groups 
other income and expense 
other income and expense includes interest income  interest expense and other  net 
interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period last year 
this increase is due an increase in debt balances  primarily associated with the senior notes and to a write off of deferred loan fees of million in connection with the early retirement of the term loan in march interest income increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period last year due primarily to million interest received on funds held on deposit in mexico

railcar leasing and management services group year ended december  in millions revenues leasing and management lease fleet sales total revenues operating profit leasing and management lease fleet sales total operating profit operating profit margin fleet utilization total revenues increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
this increase of was due to increased rental revenues related to additions to the lease fleet and improved fleet utilization as well as a slight increase in lease fleet sales 
the company continues to expand its lease fleet size 
to fund the expansion of its lease fleet to meet this demand  the leasing group uses its non recourse warehouse line to provide initial financing for a portion of the manufacturing costs of the railcars 
subsequently  the leasing group generally obtains long term financing for the cars in the lease fleet through long term recourse debt such as equipment trust certificates or long term non recourse operating leases pursuant to sale leaseback transactions 
the decline in the leasing group operating profit margin was due to the refinancing of railcars under the non recourse warehouse facility with long term  fixed rate  off balance sheet  sale leaseback financings in november and august which effectively converted interest expense which is not deducted from operating profit to lease expense which is deducted from operating profit 
the company uses a non gaap measure to compare performance between periods 
this non gaap measure is ebitdar  which is operating profit of the leasing group plus depreciation and rental or lease expense 
we use this measure to eliminate the costs resulting from financings 
ebitdar should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or other gaap 
table of contents financial measurements as an indicator of our operating performance 
ebitdar is shown below for the year ended december  in millions operating profit add depreciation rental expense ebitdar ebitdar margin the increase in ebitdar for the year ended december  was due to the increased size of the fleet and improved utilization

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  property  plant and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  insurance  restructuring costs  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in required inventory reserves may occur in the future due to then current market conditions 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used for potential impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value 
fair value 
table of contents is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available 
impairment losses on long lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for the estimated cost to dispose of the assets 
goodwill we are required  at least annually  to evaluate goodwill related to acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators that are based primarily on market conditions in the united states and europe and the operational performance of our reporting units 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue 
we base our estimates on historical warranty claims 
we also provide for specifically identified warranty obligations 
should actual claim rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
insurance we are self insured for workers compensation claims 
a third party administrator processes all such claims 
we accrue our workers compensation liability based upon independent actuarial studies 
to the extent actuarial assumptions change and claims experience rates differ from historical rates  our liability may change 
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  as of december   we have accrued our estimate of the probable settlement or judgment costs for the resolution of certain of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings 
environmental we are involved in various proceedings related to environmental matters 
we have provided reserves to cover probable and estimable liabilities with respect to such proceedings  taking into account currently available information and our contractual rights of indemnification 
however  estimates of future response costs are necessarily imprecise 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or  if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  that such costs would not be material to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payments 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
the effective date of sfas r is the first reporting period beginning after june   which is the third quarter of the company s year ending december  the company currently expects to adopt sfas r effective july  using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
financial information for periods prior to the date of adoption of sfas r would not be restated 
the company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of 
table of contents stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
the company has not yet determined which model will be used to measure the fair value of awards of equity instruments to employees upon the adoption of sfas r 
we believe the adoption of sfas r will not have a significant effect on the company s future results of operations nor will it have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
the impact of sfas r on the company s results of operations cannot be predicted at this time  because it will depend on the number of equity awards granted in the future  as well as the model and assumptions used to value the awards

table of contents additional factors that may affect future results 
we caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the securities and exchange commission  news releases  reports  proxy statements  registration statements and other written communications  as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by representatives of our company 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the risks described below 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
the cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected 
the cyclical nature of our business results in lower revenues during economic downturns 
we operate in cyclical industries 
downturns in overall economic conditions usually have a significant adverse effect on cyclical industries due to decreased demand for new and replacement products 
decreased demand could continue to result in lower sales volumes  lower prices and or a loss of profits 
the railcar industry recently experienced a deep down cycle and operated with a minimal backlog 
if this down cycle were to return  we could experience increased losses and close plants  suspend production and incur related costs 
litigation claims could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition 
we and our subsidiaries are currently and may from time to time be involved in various legal proceedings arising out of our operations 
in one such legal proceeding  we and our wholly owned subsidiary  trinity marine products  or tmp  have been named co defendants in four separate lawsuits filed by certain purchasers of our inland barges 
these claims assert damages arising from alleged defects in coating materials supplied by a co defendant and coatings application workmanship by tmp 
the plaintiffs in these cases seek compensatory and punitive damages and or rescission of the barge purchase contracts 
in one of the four cases  the plaintiff has petitioned the court for certification of a class  which  if certified by the court  could potentially increase the total number of barges involved in the litigation 
absent class certification in this case  two of the suits involve tank barges sold at an approximate average price of million  and the other two suits involve hopper barges sold at an approximate average price of  in addition  as of december   one of the four plaintiffs owed tmp approximately million related to contracts for barges not involved in the litigation 
tmp has filed suit for collection of the past due amounts 
in two other cases similar to those in the four lawsuits mentioned above  one filed by florida marine transporters  inc and the other by acf acceptance barge i  llc  we and tmp settled all claims alleged by the original plaintiffs and  as part of the settlement  received an assignment of the original plaintiffs causes of action against the remaining defendants 
in an unrelated claim  we filed a declaratory judgment action petitioning the court to declare the company s and tmp s obligations related to allegations of certain barge owners as to exterior coatings and coatings application on tank barges and tmp s rights and remedies relative to an insurance policy in which tmp was named as an additional insured which policy is applicable to the coatings on the barges 
on december   the barge owners filed a response proceeding to the declaratory judgment action claiming actual damages of million and punitive damages of million 
the transportation of commodities by railcar or barge raises potential risks in the event of a derailment  spill or other accident 
generally  liability under existing law in the united states for a derailment  spill or other accident depends on the negligence of the party  such as the railroad  the shipper or the manufacturer of the barge  railcar or its components 
however  under certain circumstances  strict liability concepts may apply 
we have appealed a final judgment in the amount of million inclusive of fees  costs and judgment interest against transit mix concrete and materials company  our wholly owned subsidiary  relating to an employee of an independent contractor who died following an accident that occurred while working at one of our manufacturing facilities 
we believe we are insured for liability in this case  if any  in excess of million 
while we maintain reserves and liability insurance at coverage levels based upon commercial norms in our industries  our reserves may be inadequate to cover these claims or lawsuits or any future claims or lawsuits arising from our busi 
table of contents nesses  and any such claims or lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or overall financial condition 
increases in the price and demand for steel could lower our margins and profitability 
the principal material used in our rail  inland barge and industrial products groups is steel 
during  the prices of steel and other components we purchased increased significantly and have been volatile on a month to month basis 
fixed price sales contracts  primarily in our rail and inland barge groups  did not provide for pass through of these cost increases to customers and operating margins suffered as a result 
at december   approximately of the railcar backlog is either covered by escalation clauses or other arrangements which reduce the exposure to future material cost increases related to those contracts 
availability of steel and components was also an issue during in general  we believe there is enough capacity to meet current production levels in the industry 
we believe our existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts 
however  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain would have an impact on both our margin and production schedules 
we have potential exposure to environmental liabilities  which may increase costs and lower profitability 
our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those dealing with air quality and the handling and disposal of waste products  fuel products and hazardous substances 
in particular  we may incur remediation costs and other related expenses because some of our manufacturing facilities were constructed and operated before the adoption of current environmental laws and the institution of compliance practices  and some of the products that we manufacture are used to transport hazardous materials 
furthermore  although we intend to conduct appropriate due diligence with respect to environmental matters in connection with future acquisitions  we may be unable to identify or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business 
environmental liabilities incurred by us  if not covered by adequate insurance or indemnification  will increase our respective costs and have a negative impact on our profitability 
we compete in highly competitive industries  which may impact our respective financial results 
we face aggressive competition in all geographic markets and each industry sector in which we operate 
as a result  competition on pricing is often intense 
the effect of this competition could reduce our revenues  limit our ability to grow  increase pricing pressure on our products  and otherwise affect our financial results 
if our railcar leasing subsidiary is unable to obtain acceptable long term financing of its railcar lease fleet  our lenders may foreclose on the portion of our lease fleet that secures our warehouse facility 
tilc  our wholly owned captive leasing subsidiary  uses borrowings under a warehouse facility to initially finance the railcars it purchases from us 
borrowings under the warehouse facility are secured by the specific railcars financed by such borrowings and the underlying leases 
the warehouse facility is nonrecourse to us and to our other subsidiaries other than trinity rail leasing trust ii  or trl ii  a qualified subsidiary of tilc that is the borrower under the warehouse facility 
borrowings under the warehouse facility are available through august  and unless renewed would be payable in three equal installments in february  august  and february a decline in the value of the railcars securing borrowings under the warehouse facility  or in the creditworthiness of the lessees under the associated leases  could reduce trl ii s ability to obtain long term financing for such railcars 
additionally  fluctuations in interest rates from the time trl ii purchases railcars with short term borrowings under the warehouse facility and the time trl ii obtains permanent financing for such railcars could decrease our profitability on the leasing of the railcars and could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
if trl ii is unable to obtain long term financing to replace borrowings under the warehouse facility  trinity may decide to satisfy trl ii s indebtedness under the warehouse facility or the lenders under the warehouse facility may foreclose on the portion of trl ii s lease fleet pledged to secure this facility 
as of december   there was million of indebtedness outstanding and million was available under the warehouse facility 

table of contents we may be unable to remarket leased railcars on favorable terms  which could result in lower lease utilization rates and reduced revenues 
the profitability of our railcar leasing business is dependent in part on our ability to re lease or sell railcars we own upon the expiration of existing lease terms 
our ability to remarket leased railcars profitably is dependent upon several factors  including  among others the cost of and demand for newer models  the availability in the market generally of other used or new railcars  the degree of obsolescence of the leased railcars  prevailing market and economic conditions  including interest and inflation rates  the need for refurbishment  the cost of materials and labor  and volume of railcar traffic 
a downturn in the industries in which our lessees operate and decreased demand for railcars could also increase our exposure to remarket risk because lessees may demand shorter lease terms  requiring us to remarket leased railcars more frequently 
furthermore  the resale market for previously leased railcars has a limited number of potential buyers 
our inability to re lease or sell leased railcars on favorable terms could result in lower lease utilization rates and reduced revenues 
fluctuations in the supply of component parts used in the production of our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to cost effectively manufacture and sell our products 
a significant portion of our business depends on the adequate supply of numerous specialty components such as brakes  wheels  side frames and bolsters at competitive prices 
we depend on third party suppliers for a significant portion of our component part needs 
specialty components comprise a significant portion of the production cost of each railcar we manufacture 
due to consolidations and challenging industry conditions  the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years  though generally a minimum of three suppliers continue to produce each type of component we use in our products 
while we endeavor to be diligent in contractual relationships with our suppliers  a significant decrease in the availability of specialty components could materially increase our cost of goods sold or prevent us from manufacturing our products on a timely basis 
reductions in the availability of energy supplies or an increase in energy costs may increase our operating costs 
we use natural gas at our manufacturing facilities and use diesel fuel in vehicles to transport our tank containers to customers and to operate our plant equipment 
over the past three years  prices for natural gas have fluctuated significantly 
an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the united states and any foreign power and  in particular  a prolonged armed conflict in the middle east  could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and or natural gas  which could result in an increase in the cost of natural gas prices or energy generally 
future limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products and or an increase in energy costs  particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles and plant equipment  could have an adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business cost effectively 
our manufacturer s warranties expose us to potentially significant claims 
we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products under express limited warranties 
accordingly  we may be subject to significant warranty claims in the future such as multiple claims based on one defect repeated throughout our mass production process or claims for which the cost of repairing the defective part is highly disproportionate to the original cost of the part 
these types of warranty claims could result in costly product recalls  significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 
increasing insurance claims and expenses could lower profitability and increase business risk 
the nature of our business subjects us to product liability  property damage and personal injury claims  especially in connection with the repair and manufacture of products that transport hazardous or volatile materials 
we maintain reserves and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial norms in the industries in which we operate and our historical claims experience 
over the last several years  insurance carriers have raised premiums for many companies operating in our industries 
increased premiums may further increase our insurance expense as coverages expire or cause us to raise our self insured retention 
if the number or severity of claims within our self insured retention increases  we could suffer costs in excess of our 
table of contents reserves 
an unusually large liability claim or a string of claims based on a failure repeated throughout our mass production process may exceed our insurance coverage or result in direct damages if we were unable or elected not to insure against certain hazards because of high premiums or other reasons 
in addition  the availability of  and our ability to collect on  insurance coverage is often subject to factors beyond our control 
moreover  any accident or incident involving us  even if we are fully insured or not held to be liable  could negatively affect our reputation among customers and the public  thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively  and could significantly affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future 
risks related to our operations outside of the united states could decrease our profitability 
our operations outside of the united states are subject to the risks associated with cross border business transactions and activities 
political  legal  trade or economic changes or instability could limit or curtail our respective foreign business activities and operations 
some foreign countries where we operate have regulatory authorities that regulate railroad safety  railcar design and railcar component part design  performance and manufacture of equipment used on their railroad systems 
if we fail to obtain and maintain certifications of our railcars and railcar parts within the various foreign countries where we operate  we may be unable to market and sell our railcars in those countries 
in addition  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  more stringent rules relating to labor or the environment  adverse tax consequences and price exchange controls could limit operations and make the manufacture and distribution of our products difficult 
furthermore  any material change in the quotas  regulations or duties on imports imposed by the us government and agencies or on exports by the government of mexico or its agencies could affect our ability to export the railcars and propane tanks that we manufacture in mexico 
because we do not have employment contracts with our key management employees  we may not be able to retain their services in the future 
our success depends on the continued services of our key management employees  none of whom currently have employment agreements with us 
although we have historically been successful in retaining the services of our key management  we may be unable to do so in the future 
the loss of the services of one or more key members of our management team could result in increased costs associated with attracting and retaining a replacement and could disrupt our operations and result in a loss of revenues 
repercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm our business 
terrorist activities  anti terrorist efforts and other armed conflict involving the united states or its interests abroad may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations 
in particular  the negative impacts of these events may affect the industries in which we operate 
this could result in delays in or cancellations of the purchase of our products or shortages in raw materials or component parts 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results  revenues and costs 
violations of or changes in the regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate may increase our operating costs 
we are subject to extensive regulation by governmental regulatory and industry authorities 
our railcar operations are subject to regulation by the environmental protection agency  the research and special programs administration  a division of the department of transportation  the federal railroad administration  a division of the department of transportation  and the association of american railroads 
these organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry  including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars  mechanical  maintenance and related standards for railcars  safety of railroad equipment  tracks and operations  and packaging and transportation of hazardous materials 
future changes that affect compliance costs may have a material adverse effect on financial conditions and operations 
our inland barge operations are subject to regulation by the united states coast guard  the national transportation safety board  the united states customs service  the maritime administration of the united states department of transportation  and private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these organizations establish safety criteria  investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
violations of these regulations and related laws can 
table of contents result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
our operations are also subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the united states occupations safety and health administration 
we believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities 
however  claims that may be asserted against us for work related illnesses or injury  and the further adoption of occupational health and safety regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs 
we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these health and safety laws and regulations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceedings  that such costs would not be material to us 
we may be required to reduce our inventory carrying values  which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we are required to record our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
we have recorded reductions in inventory carrying values in recent periods due to discontinuance of product lines as well as changes in market conditions due to changes in demand requirements 
we may be required to reduce inventory carrying values in the future due to a decline in market conditions in the railcar business  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to reduce the value of our long lived assets and or goodwill  which would weaken our financial condition and results of operations 
we periodically evaluate the carrying values of our long lived assets to be held and used for potential impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available 
impairment losses on long lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for the estimated cost to dispose of the assets 
in addition  we are required  at least annually  to evaluate goodwill related to acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators that are based primarily on market conditions in the united states and europe and the operational performance of our reporting units 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss related to reductions in the value of our long lived assets or our goodwill could weaken our financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we seek to minimize these risks  when considered appropriate  through the use of currency and interest rate hedges and similar financial instruments and other activities  although these measures may not be implemented or effective 
any material and untimely changes in interest rates or exchange rates could result in significant losses to us

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings could be affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our variable rate debt obligations  which represented approximately of our total debt as of december  we have hedged all of this exposure with interest rate swaps leaving none of our total debt exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
if interest rates average one percentage point more in fiscal year than they did during in  our interest expense would not increase as all of our variable debt is hedged 
in comparison  at december   we estimated that if interest 
table of contents rates averaged one percentage point more in fiscal year than they did during the year ended december   interest expense would have increased by approximately million 
the impact of an increase in interest rates was determined based on the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates and scheduled principal payments on our variable rate debt obligations as of december  and in addition  we are subject to market risk related to our net investments in our foreign subsidiaries 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries as of december  is million 
however  the impact of such market risk exposures as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations has not been material to us
