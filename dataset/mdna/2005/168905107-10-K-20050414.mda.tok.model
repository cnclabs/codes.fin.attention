factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors 
overview the children s place retail stores  inc and subsidiaries the company is a specialty retailer of merchandise for children from newborn to ten years of age 
the company designs  contracts to manufacture and sells high quality  value priced apparel and accessories and other children s oriented merchandise under two brands and store concepts the children s place and disney store 
as of april   we operated the children s place stores in the united states  canada and puerto rico and disney stores in the united states and canada 
in addition  we currently operate an internet store at www 
childrensplace 
com and in october  we will operate an internet store at www 
disneystore 
com 
in november  the company acquired the disney store retail chain in north america  consisting of stores located in the united states and canada and an internet store the dsna business 
this acquisition provided us with a strong brand through which we can serve our target customer  thus increasing our overall revenue and profitability opportunities 
we believe those financial opportunities can be realized through the application of our sourcing and manufacturing strategies  merchandising expertise  everyday value pricing strategy  store design experience and leveraging our infrastructure across a larger sales base 
during fiscal  as a result of the execution of our strategic initiatives and the acquisition of the dsna business  the company achieved strong financial results 
net sales in fiscal increased to billion  compared to net sales of million reported in fiscal our net sales included million from the ten weeks we operated the disney stores 
during fiscal  net sales from our the children s place business increased million  which represented a increase over fiscal during fiscal  we reported a comparable store sales increase of compared to a increase in fiscal correspondingly  we believe our market share in children s apparel increased to from in fiscal net income in fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in fiscal our fiscal strategies of providing our the children s place customers with a clear and focused product assortment  improved garment quality and everyday value pricing  as well as a greater depth of inventory ownership to ensure better in stock position have contributed significantly to our financial performance in fiscal during fiscal  we plan to build on our progress at the children s place stores by continuing to focus on increasing store productivity and on elevating our brand awareness through external advertising 
we plan to open approximately the children s place stores in fiscal  in the united states  in canada and seven in puerto rico 
given the timing of the acquisition of the dsna business immediately in advance of the all important holiday season  we did not want to disrupt core business operations 
therefore  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we contracted with a disney subsidiary for certain transition services such as financial  merchandising and logistics  and information technology 
at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal  much of the administrative disney stores integration has been completed and we are no longer using disney s transition services 
we have migrated successfully the disney store business onto all of our information technology and financial systems  and we have integrated the disney stores onto our merchandising and logistics infrastructure 
for clarification  the dsna business refers to the business we acquired from disney as of november   whereas the disney store business refers to the disney store business we have operated since the acquisition 
to distinguish between our two businesses and to stay target market focused  we maintain separate design  merchandising  marketing and store operations functions in our california office to support the disney stores 
our corporate offices in new jersey will provide administrative  financial  human resources and information technology services to both businesses 
for our disney store business  our focus will be on improving gross margin through reduced product sourcing costs  while providing improved merchandise quality at lower retail prices to our customer 
due to the long lead time of our merchandise purchases  we will begin to impact our gross margin commencing in the back to school season 
during fiscal  subject to approval of disney  we plan to remodel between and disney stores to a new mickey store prototype we have developed  which we believe will enhance the customers shopping experience 
we also plan to open approximately new disney stores in fiscal  including approximately six outlet stores 
during the nine week period ended april   we reported total sales of million  a increase compared to sales of million during the nine week period ended april  sales for the nine week period include million from the children s place and million from the disney stores 
our comparable store sales increased by during the nine weeks ended april   compared to a increase in comparable store sales during the corresponding nine week period last year 
the disney stores will not be included in the comparable store sales base until february  when we expect approximately disney stores to be added 
we define comparable store sales as net sales from stores that have been open for more than months and have not been substantially remodeled during that time 
consequently  as we embark on the store remodel program for the disney stores  the to store remodels planned for fiscal  and future remodels  will be excluded from the comparable store sales base 
financial restatement for lease related accounting in light of a recent sec clarification on lease accounting  we re evaluated our lease accounting policies and have corrected the way we account for our leases  specifically the accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases and landlord construction allowances 
under the requirements of fasb technical bulletin  accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  rent expense is required to be recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
in prior periods  we had incorrectly determined that the term of the lease begins on the commencement date of the lease  which generally coincides with the store opening date 
we have corrected this policy to properly commence the lease for accounting purposes when we take physical possession of the property to begin construction 
this correction has the effect of including the construction period in the determination of the period over which rent is calculated 
we continue to capitalize occupancy costs incurred prior to the commencement of store pre opening activities 
these capitalized costs are amortized over the remaining lease term 
the net effect of this correction was to increase depreciation expense with a corresponding decrease to rent expense and to increase the amount of deferred rent liabilities with a corresponding increase in leasehold improvements 
we have corrected our prior years consolidated financial statements to properly account for these lease related issues 
in addition  under fasb technical bulletin  issues relating to accounting for leases  lease incentives such as landlord construction allowances received to defray construction costs incurred by us should be reflected as a deferred lease incentive  amortized over the lease term and reflected as a reduction to rent expense 
we had previously incorrectly classified landlord construction allowances as a reduction to property and equipment instead of as a deferred lease incentive 
in fiscal  we have corrected our accounting policy to treat landlord construction allowances as deferred lease incentives 
we have restated our prior years consolidated financial statements to properly account for landlord construction allowances 
the primary impact of the restatement was to reclassify  and in some instances increase or decrease  certain expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
in addition  property and equipment and other long term assets were increased  with corresponding increases in deferred rent liabilities 
while the correction of the errors did not change total cash position  changes in classification were made in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash flows provided from operating activities increased with a corresponding increase in cash flows used in investing activities 
in fiscal and fiscal  cost of sales was reduced by million and million  respectively 
conversely  depreciation expense was increased by million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition  the asset impairment charge in fiscal increased by million 
net income for fiscal and fiscal is now million  or diluted net income per share of  and million  or diluted net income per share of  respectively 
in addition to the changes in net income  restated net property and equipment  total assets and total liabilities as of january  were million  million and million  respectively 
while the correction of the errors did not change our total cash position  classification of landlord construction allowances received in the consolidated statements of cash flows changed from cash flows used in investing activities to cash flows provided by operating activities 
for fiscal and fiscal  cash flows provided by operating activities increased by approximately million and million  respectively  with offsetting increases in cash flows used in investing activities 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating reported financial results include the following revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at our retail stores or when received by the customer if the product was purchased via the internet  net of coupon redemptions and anticipated sales returns 
actual sales return rates have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established 
however  in the event that the actual rate of sales returns by customers increased significantly  our operational results could be adversely affected 
our net sales include the commission we receive from a disney subsidiary on the sale of walt disney world resort and disneyland resort tickets 
our policy with respect to gift cards is to record revenue as the gift cards are redeemed for merchandise 
for the children s place  prior to their redemption  unredeemed gift cards are recorded as a liability  included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
we have not reduced our gift card liabilities for gift cards that are not expected to be redeemed 
for disney store  we act as an agent on behalf of disney for gift cards sold to customers 
therefore  we do not record a customer gift card liability for the disney store 
however  we recognize a trade payable to disney for the net purchases and redemptions of disney gift cards 
we offer a private label credit card to our children s place customers that provides a discount on future purchases once a minimum annual purchase threshold has been exceeded 
we estimate the future discounts to be provided based on prior year history  the number of customers who have earned or are likely to earn the discount and current year sales trends on the private label credit card 
we defer a proportionate amount of revenue from customers based on an estimated value of future discounts 
we recognize such deferred revenue as future discounts are taken on sales above the minimum 
this is done by utilizing estimates based upon sales trends and the number of customers who have earned the discount privilege 
all deferred revenue is recognized by the end of the fiscal year  as our private label customers must earn the discount privilege on an annual basis  and such privilege expires prior to our fiscal year end 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market  using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio by merchandise department to the retail value of inventories 
at any one time  inventories include items that have been marked down to our best estimate of their fair market value 
we base our decision to mark down merchandise upon its current rate of sale  the season  and the age and sell through of the item 
to the extent that our markdown estimates are not adequate  additional markdowns may have to be recorded  which could reduce our gross margins and operating results 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion taste of our customers  including the popularity and relevancy of the disney characters  and to provide a well balanced merchandise assortment that satisfies customer demand 
any inability to provide the proper quantity of appropriate merchandise in a timely manner could increase future markdown rates 
accounting for acquisitions the acquisition of the dsna business is being accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
as such  the company has undertaken an analysis of the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and determined the preliminary excess of fair value of net assets acquired over cost 
we utilized estimates to determine the fair value of inventory  acquired leases and certain acquisition costs 
we will continue to monitor our estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed  and while not anticipated  we may adjust these amounts during fiscal we believe that any changes to these amounts will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
accounting for royalties in exchange for the right to use certain disney intellectual property  we are required to pay a disney subsidiary royalty payments pursuant to a license and conduct of business agreement the license agreement 
minimum royalty commitments are recorded on a straight line basis over the life of the initial year term of the license agreement 
during each period  amounts due in excess of the minimum royalty commitment are recorded as an expense if we expect to surpass the minimum royalty commitment on an annual basis  even if the contingency threshold has not been surpassed in that particular period 
we were granted a royalty holiday for all stores for two years 
in addition  depending on the specific store location  certain stores have an extension of the royalty holiday for up to eight years 
the actual value of the royalty holiday is not determinable until the completion of the royalty holiday period  and may differ materially from our current estimate 
changes in the estimates for the royalty holiday are adjusted on a periodic basis 
the amortization of the estimated value of the royalty holiday is recognized on a straight line basis as a reduction of royalty expense over the term of the license agreement 
royalty expense  and the associated amortization of the royalty holiday  is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the royalty percentage does not increase over the initial year term of the license agreement  except for royalties on internet sales 
in the first year  the internet royalty is  and  and in certain instances   thereafter 
we expect the effective net royalty expense to range from to of net sales of the disney store business 
rent expense and deferred rent rent expense and rent incentives  including landlord construction allowances  are recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term  beginning on the date of physical possession 
the company records rent expense and rent incentives as a component of cost of sales 
the unamortized portion of deferred rent is included in accrued expenses and deferred rent liabilities 
rent incurred during construction  prior to commencement of store pre opening activities  is capitalized and then amortized starting over the remaining lease term 
unamortized pre opening rent is included in leasehold improvements 
impairment of assets we continually evaluate each store s performance and measure the carrying value of each location s fixed assets  principally leasehold improvements and fixtures  versus its projected cash flows 
an impairment loss is recorded if the projected future cash flows are insufficient to recapture the net book value of their assets 
to the extent our estimates of future cash flows are incorrect  additional impairment charges may be recorded in future periods 
litigation we reserve litigation settlements when we can determine the probability of outcome and can estimate costs 
estimates are adjusted as facts and circumstances require 
we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business 
in our opinion  any ultimate liability arising out of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our future business 
stock options we record no compensation expense on our financial statements for stock based compensation  since we grant stock options at prices that equal or exceed the fair market value of our common stock at the date of the grant 
effective in the third quarter of fiscal  we will be required to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the stock based compensation granted to employees 
we are currently assessing the full impact of the new accounting rules related to stock based compensation on our future results of operations and financial position 
regardless  the additional expense required to be recognized by the new accounting rules will negatively impact net income 
in addition  increases to our stock price would result in more diluted shares outstanding and reduce our diluted net income per common share 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january  january  february  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses asset impairment charges depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense income  net income before income taxes and extraordinary gain provision for income taxes income before extraordinary gain extraordinary gain  net of taxes net income number of stores  end of period year ended january  compared to year ended january  net sales increased by million  or  to billion during fiscal from million during fiscal net sales include million from the ten weeks we operated the disney stores since their acquisition on november  net sales from our the children s place business increased million  or during fiscal comparable store sales increased and contributed million of our net sales increase during fiscal during fiscal  our comparable store sales increase was primarily the result of a increase in the number of comparable store sales transactions and a increase in our average dollar transaction size 
comparable store sales increased during fiscal net sales for our new stores as well as other stores that did not qualify as comparable stores increased our net sales by million 
during fiscal  we opened the children s place stores  in the united states  in canada and six in puerto rico 
in addition  we closed three the children s place stores and seven disney stores in fiscal during fiscal  we achieved double digit comparable store sales increases across all our geographical regions  departments and store types in the children s place business 
our west and southwest regions reported the strongest comparable store sales increases 
by department  our accessories and boys departments achieved the highest comparable store sales increases 
we are unable to predict if our current sales trends will continue 
gross profit increased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal the decrease in gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was principally due to lower merchandise margins and the impact of the fair value write up of disney store inventory  partially offset by the leveraging of occupancy costs over a larger sales base 
for the children s place business  as a percentage of net sales  our merchandise margins were lower than last year due to a lower initial markup partially offset by lower markdowns 
our disney store business merchandise margins are lower than the children s place business  this unfavorably impacted gross margin by  as a percentage of net sales 
overall  the disney store business has a lower initial markup than the children s place business 
during fiscal  we plan to apply our low cost sourcing expertise to disney store 
these plans have been initiated and will begin to impact operating results in the second half of fiscal as mentioned above  gross profit during fiscal was unfavorably impacted by a million charge  or of net sales  for the write up of the acquired disney store inventory sold during the ten weeks ended january  to its fair value from the value determined under the retail inventory method 
approximately million in fair value inventory write up remains on our balance sheet as of january   which we expect will be charged to cost of sales during the first quarter of fiscal the remaining unfavorable gross margin variance  as a percentage of net sales  resulted primarily from higher distribution and buying expenses 
during fiscal  occupancy costs  as a percentage of net sales  decreased as a result of our comparable store sales increase and larger sales base 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales during fiscal as compared to of net sales during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower store payroll and the leveraging of store expenses  partially offset by disney store royalty expense and transition services associated with the acquisition of the disney stores 
due to our strong comparable store sales performance during fiscal  our store payroll expenses were lower  as a percentage of net sales  than fiscal disney store royalty expense and transition costs represented approximately of net sales during fiscal the remainder of our favorable selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  resulted primarily from the leveraging of store expenses 
during fiscal  we recorded a non cash asset impairment charge of million before taxes for the write down of leasehold improvements and fixtures in one underperforming store 
this compares to a write down for million before taxes incurred in fiscal related to one underperforming store 
impairment charges were recorded because the cash flow projections for these stores over their remaining lease terms were insufficient to recapture the net book value of their assets 
depreciation and amortization amounted to million  or of net sales  during fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of net sales  is the result of the leveraging of the expense over a larger sales base and the absence of depreciation and amortization for the dsna business 
consistent with us gaap  since the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeded the amounts paid to acquire the dsna business  we recorded no basis in the property  plant and equipment we acquired with the dsna business  and therefore no depreciation was recorded 
our provision for income taxes for fiscal was million  as compared to a million provision in fiscal the increase in our tax provision was primarily due to our increased profitability in fiscal  as well as an increase in our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared with an effective tax rate of in fiscal our effective tax rate in fiscal was favorably impacted by the reversal of a million valuation allowance on a prior year loss incurred by our canadian subsidiary 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate will increase in fiscal to approximately 
during fiscal  we recorded a million extraordinary gain  net of taxes 
this extraordinary gain represents the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in excess of amounts paid to acquire the dsna business 
due to the factors discussed above  net income in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal year ended january  compared to year ended february  net sales increased by million or to million during fiscal from million during fiscal during fiscal  we opened stores and closed stores 
net sales for the new stores opened  as well as other stores that did not qualify as comparable stores  contributed million of our net sales increase 
our comparable store sales increased and contributed million of our net sales increase 
comparable store sales decreased during fiscal our comparable store sales increase in fiscal reflected the impact of strategic initiatives we commenced in fiscal to improve our sales performance 
these initiatives included a more focused product offering with a greater concentration of basic merchandise  as well as improved garment quality and the reduction of our prices to an everyday value pricing strategy 
during fiscal  our comparable store sales increase was primarily the result of a increase in the number of comparable store sales transactions  partially offset by a decrease in our average dollar transaction size 
gross profit increased by million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to during fiscal from during fiscal during fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to lower markdowns of of net sales  partially offset by a lower initial markup of of net sales due to our strategic decision to lower prices 
the remainder of our favorable gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  was due to the leveraging of occupancy  production and design costs over a larger sales base 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses represented of net sales during fiscal  as compared with of net sales during fiscal the increase  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily due to higher marketing costs  higher store payroll and lower insurance proceeds  partially offset by lower pre opening costs 
during fiscal  we increased our marketing efforts to promote brand awareness and to drive sales 
as a result  marketing costs  as a percentage of net sales  increased 
our store payroll increased  as a percentage of net sales  because we increased our store payroll hours to provide more sales assistance to our customers 
during fiscal  insurance proceeds approximated million  or of net sales  resulting primarily from partial settlement of our claim from our world trade center store for business interruption and inventory losses 
during fiscal  we received insurance proceeds of approximately million  or of net sales  resulting primarily from a partial settlement of our claim from our world trade center store and a property damage claim from one of our distribution centers 
during fiscal  we recorded lower pre opening costs of  as a percentage of net sales  as a result of opening new stores  as compared to new stores opened during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a non cash asset impairment charge of million before taxes for the writedown of leasehold improvements and fixtures in one underperforming store 
this compares to a writedown of million before taxes incurred in fiscal related to underperforming stores 
impairment charges were recorded because the cash flow projections for these stores over their remaining lease terms were insufficient to recapture the net book value of their assets 
during fiscal  we closed five stores  of which three stores had been identified as impaired during fiscal depreciation and amortization amounted to million  or of net sales  during fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily was a result of a larger store base 
depreciation and amortization decreased  as a percentage of net sales  as a result of the leveraging of the expense over a larger sales base 
our provision for income taxes for fiscal was million  as compared to a million provision in fiscal the increase in our tax provision was primarily due to our increased profitability in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared with an effective tax rate of in fiscal our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal primarily as a result of the reversal of a million valuation allowance on losses incurred by our canadian subsidiary in fiscal we did not recognize a tax benefit for our canadian losses in fiscal and established a valuation allowance 
due to the factors discussed above  net income in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources acquisition of the dsna business on november   effective as of november  the closing date  we consummated the acquisition of the dsna business  pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement entered into on october  the acquisition agreement  between two of our subsidiaries  as purchasers  and two subsidiaries of disney  as sellers 
pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement  our subsidiaries acquired of the outstanding equity interests in the disney store  llc tds usa and of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the disney store canada ltd 
tds canada from the sellers 
at the time of the acquisition  tds usa and tds canada  which became our owned operating subsidiaries  hold a total of disney stores  consisting of all existing disney stores in the united states and canada  other than flagship stores and stores located at disney theme parks and other disney properties  along with certain other assets used in the disney store business  and all store lease and other legal obligations of tds usa and tds canada remained the obligations of these operating subsidiaries 
in consideration for the transfer by the sellers to our subsidiaries of the equity interests in tds usa and tds canada  an estimated working capital payment in the amount of million became payable to the sellers in connection with the consummation of the acquisition 
the amount of this working capital payment  which is subject to adjustment  primarily reflected the level of inventory at the disney stores for the holiday season as of november  as well as a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses prior to consummation of the acquisition 
of this amount  on november   million was paid by the children s place retail stores  inc and million was paid by tds usa  as permitted by the acquisition agreement 
payment of the remaining million was made by the children s place retail stores  inc on december  pursuant to a guaranty and commitment entered into in connection with the acquisition the guaranty and commitment  we invested million into our new subsidiary hoop retail stores  llc hoop usa  which merged with tds usa following the acquisition  with hoop usa surviving the merger 
hoop usa now operates the disney store business in the united states and indirectly owns the entire equity interest in the entity that operates the disney store business in canada 
under the terms of the guaranty and commitment  we are obligated to invest up to an additional million in hoop usa  as necessary  from time to time in the future to enable hoop usa and its canadian operating subsidiary to comply with their obligations and operate the disney store business 
pursuant to the guaranty and commitment  we also agreed to guarantee the payment and performance by hoop usa and its canadian operating subsidiary and certain of their affiliates of their royalty payment and other obligations to disney under the license agreement  subject to a maximum guaranty liability of the children s place retail stores  inc of million  plus expenses 
the license agreement limits our ability to receive cash dividends or other distributions from the hoop operating entities 
the hoop operating entities independent directors must approve payment of any dividends or other distributions to us  other than payments of amounts due under the terms of tax sharing and intercompany services agreements  approximately million to recoup the portion of the purchase price paid by the company to disney limited to cumulative cash flows since the date of the acquisition  and certain other dividend payments  subject to satisfaction of certain additional operating conditions  and limited to of cumulative cash flows up to million  and of cumulative cash flows thereafter 
we funded our capital commitment for the acquisition and our portion of the working capital payment partially through cash on hand and partially through short term borrowings under our recently expanded credit facility pursuant to which wells fargo retail finance  llc wells fargo serves as agent 
tds usa funded its million portion of the working capital payment  and the issuance of million of standby letters of credit to the sellers as required by the acquisition agreement primarily for the purpose of backing up the sellers obligations for merchandise on order and freight services  by drawing upon their newly established credit facility 
debt service liquidity our working capital needs follow a seasonal pattern  peaking during the second and third quarters when inventory is purchased for the back to school and holiday selling seasons 
prior to the acquisition of the dsna business  our primary uses of cash were financing new store openings and providing for working capital  which principally represented the purchase of inventory 
also  we met our cash needs principally by using cash on hand  cash flows from operations and seasonal borrowings under our credit facilities 
since borrowings under the amended loan agreement as defined below were used to partially fund the acquisition  we have had borrowings under that credit facility since the closing date 
we expect to continue to borrow under the amended loan agreement for much of fiscal there were no borrowings under the hoop loan agreement at the end of fiscal  and we expect to use this facility only in support of letters of credit throughout fiscal we manage liquidity for the children s place and the disney stores separately  including cash receipts  disbursements and credit facilities 
we expect to have no borrowings on the disney store credit facility and seasonal borrowings on the children s place credit facility during fiscal prior to october   we had a credit facility the original wells fargo credit facility with wells fargo retail finance  llc 
the original wells fargo credit facility provided for borrowings up to million including a sublimit for letters of credit of million 
the original wells fargo credit facility also contained provisions to allow us to increase borrowings up to million including a sublimit for letters of credit of million  subject to sufficient collateralization and the syndication of the incremental line of borrowing 
the amount that could be borrowed under the original wells fargo credit facility depended on our levels of inventory and accounts receivable 
amounts outstanding under the facility bore interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate or  at our option  a libor rate plus a pre determined spread 
the libor spread was to  depending on our level of availability from time to time 
the original wells fargo credit facility contained covenants  which included limitations on our annual capital expenditures  maintenance of certain levels of excess collateral and a prohibition on the payment of dividends 
credit extended under the original wells fargo credit facility was secured by a first priority security interest in all our assets  except for our assets in canada 
the original wells fargo facility would have expired in april and provided for one year renewal options 
as of october   we amended and restated our credit facility with wells fargo the amended loan agreement  partly in connection with our acquisition of the dsna business 
the amended loan agreement provides for borrowings up to million including a sublimit for letters of credit of million and extends the term of the facility until november  with successive one year renewal options 
the amended loan agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets  other than assets in canada and assets owned by our subsidiaries that were formed in connection with the acquisition of the dsna business 
the amount that can be borrowed under the amended loan agreement depends on our levels of inventory and accounts receivable relating to the children s place business 
amounts outstanding under the amended loan agreement bear interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate or  at our option  a libor rate plus a pre determined spread 
the libor spread will be to  depending on our level of availability from time to time 
the amended loan agreement also contains covenants  which include limitations on our annual capital expenditures  maintenance of certain levels of excess collateral and a prohibition on the payment of dividends 
as of january   there were million in borrowings under the amended loan agreement as compared to no borrowings under the original wells fargo credit facility as of january  during fiscal  prior to the dsna business acquisition in november  our borrowings under the original wells fargo credit facility represented overnight borrowings for letters of credit that cleared after business hours 
our maximum borrowings under the amended loan agreement was million on november  to satisfy a portion of our payment obligations in connection with the disney store acquisition 
availability under the amended loan agreement as of january  was million 
letters of credit outstanding under the amended loan agreement as of january  were million 
availability under the original wells fargo credit facility was million as of january  the interest rates charged under the amended loan agreement were per annum as of january  interest rates charged under the original wells fargo credit facility were per annum as of january  we were in compliance with all of the covenants  as amended  under the amended loan agreement and the hoop loan agreement as of january  noncompliance with these covenants could result in additional fees  affect our ability to borrow or require us to repay the outstanding balance 
in connection with our acquisition of the dsna business  tds usa and its successor hoop usa and the subsidiaries of hoop usa  as guarantors  entered into a loan and security agreement the hoop loan agreement dated as of november  with certain financial institutions and wells fargo  as administrative agent  establishing a senior secured credit facility for the dsna business 
the hoop loan agreement provides for borrowings up to million including a sublimit for letters of credit of million  subject to the amount of eligible inventory and accounts receivable of hoop usa from time to time 
the term of the facility extends until november  amounts outstanding under the hoop loan agreement bear interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate plus a pre determined margin or  at hoop usa s option  the libor rate plus a pre determined margin

our business is also subject to seasonal influences  with heavier concentrations of sales during the back to school and holiday seasons 
with the addition of the disney store business  which historically has been weighted more heavily to the halloween and holiday seasons  the company s seasonality has shifted to be more concentrated in the latter half of the calendar year

our first quarter results are heavily dependent upon sales during the period leading up to the easter holiday 
our third quarter results are heavily dependent upon back to school and halloween sales and our fourth quarter results are heavily dependent upon sales during the holiday season 
we experienced losses in the second quarter of and the second quarter of and expect to experience a second quarter loss in fiscal we may continue to experience second quarter losses in future periods 
it is also possible we could experience losses in other quarters 
because of these fluctuations in net sales and net income loss  the results of operations of any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter

quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company s financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income 
the company utilizes cash from operations and short term borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
cash balances are normally invested in short term financial instruments 
because of the short term nature of these investments  changes in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of these financial instruments

under sfas  these instruments were not designated as hedges 
the realized losses on these forward currency contracts amounted to  as of january   the company is not a party to any derivative financial instruments
