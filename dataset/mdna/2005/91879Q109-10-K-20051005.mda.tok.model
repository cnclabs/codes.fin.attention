the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement included at the end of this section 
the following management s discussion and analysis includes discussion of financial performance within each of the company s segments 
the company has chosen to specifically address a non gaap measure  reported ebitda defined as segment net revenues less segment specific operating expenses plus gain on transfer of property  as applicable  plus segment equity income  in the following discussion because management considers this measurement to be a significant indication of the company s financial performance 
the company evaluates performance and allocates resources to its segments based on reported ebitda 
in addition  because of the significant long lived assets to the operations of the company and the level of the company s indebtedness  the company believes that reported ebitda is useful in measuring the company s ability to fund expenditures and service debt 
the company uses reported ebitda targets in determining management bonuses 
refer to the end of the results of operations section for a reconciliation of reported ebitda to net income loss 
reported ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
items excluded from reported ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
reported ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to  or substitute for  net income  cash flows generated by operations  investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity 
because reported ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  reported ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
overview the company s operations are grouped into three integrated and interdependent segments mountain  lodging and real estate  which represented  and  respectively  of the company s revenues for fiscal the mountain segment is comprised of the operation of five ski resort properties and related amenities  primarily including ski school  dining  and retail rental operations 
operations within the lodging segment include ownership management of a group of ten luxury hotels through the rockresorts brand  including three proximate to the company s ski resorts  the operations of gtlc  the ownership management of non rockresorts branded hotels and condominiums proximate to the company s ski resorts and golf course operations 
the real estate segment is involved with the development of property in and around the company s resort properties 
the company s single largest source of revenue is the sale of lift tickets including season passes  which represented approximately of total fiscal net revenue 
lift ticket revenues are driven by volume skier visits and average pricing 
pricing is impacted by both absolute pricing as well as the demographic mix of guests  which impacts the price points at which various products are purchased 
the demographic mix of guests is divided into two primary categories out of state and international guests destination and in state and local visitors in state 
destination guests comprise approximately of the company s skier visits  while the in state market comprises approximately of the company s skier visits 
nearly of total visitors and of destinations visitors fly to the company s resorts 
destination guests generally purchase the company s higher priced lift ticket products and utilize more ancillary services like ski school and lodging 
destination guests are less likely to be impacted by changes in the weather  due to the advance planning required for their trip  but can be impacted by the economy including the strength of the us dollar and the global geopolitical climate 
in state guests tend to be more weather sensitive and value oriented  to mitigate against this  approximately of total lift revenue is generated from the sale of season passes  which are marketed primarily to in state guests 
the cost structure of ski resort operations is largely fixed  as such  incremental revenue generally has high associated profit margin 
revenues of the lodging properties at or around the company s ski resorts are closely aligned with the performance of the mountain segment  particularly with respect to visitation from destination guests 
revenues from hotel management operations under the rockresorts brand not located around the company s ski resorts are generated through management fees based upon the revenue of the individual hotel properties within the rockresorts portfolio  and are therefore subject to trends within the overall travel industry 
gtlc  which is a national park service nps concession within grand teton national park  benefits from the enormous popularity of the national park system 
gtlc s pricing is regulated by the nps 
the company s real estate segment engages in both the sale of land to developers  which generally includes the retention of some control in the oversight and design of the projects and a contingent revenue structure based on the sale of the developed units and  in a growing trend  vertical development of projects 
the company mitigates the risk of vertical development by utilizing fixed price contracts  pre selling the project  requiring significant non refundable deposits and the obtaining of non recourse financing for certain projects 
the company s real estate projects generally are geared to provide additional benefit to the mountain and lodging segments 
trends  risks and uncertainties the company s management has identified the following important factors as well as risks and uncertainties associated with such factors that could impact the company s future financial performance the timing and amount of snowfall has a direct impact on skier visits  particularly with respect to in state skiers 
to mitigate this impact  the company focuses efforts on sales of season passes 
the company raised prices for the season and early signs indicate favorable trends in volume and dollars 
however  there can be no certainty that such favorable trends will continue in the future 
the company plans to raise prices on most lift ticket products for fiscal and continues to charge some of the highest prices in the industry 
while pricing increases historically have not reduced demand  there can be no assurances that demand will remain price inelastic 
the company operates its ski areas under various forest service permits  and many of the company s operations require permits and approval from governmental authorities 
changes or impacts of the regulatory environment applicable to the company may have detrimental effects on the company 
the timing of major holidays can impact vacation patterns and therefore visitation at the company s ski resorts 
in fiscal  christmas falls on a sunday  which could result in softer visitation for this holiday period as compared to years in which the holiday does not fall on a weekend 
additionally  easter falls in mid april in  which management anticipates will be unfavorable compared to the impact of the march easter holiday in in fiscal  the company successfully executed its strategy to reduce hotel ownership in favor of increasing its managed property portfolio with the sales of the assets constituting the vail marriott mountain resort spa vail marriott and the lodge at rancho mirage rancho mirage and the sale of the company s investment in the ritz carlton  bachelor gulch bg resort 
the company retained management contracts for both the vail marriott and rancho mirage 
in addition  the company is actively marketing the assets constituting srl s for sale  with planned retention of the management contract 
the company expects a sale to be consummated in fiscal other than the sale of the assets constituting srl s  the company does not have further specific agreements to dispose of more hotels 
however  the company continues to evaluate potential sales and other strategic initiatives which could involve the conversion of hotel rooms to real estate projects with respect to some of its lodging properties 
the sale of owned hotel properties will result in lodging segment reported ebitda no longer reflecting the operating results of the hotels  but will include management fee revenue  in cases where the management contract is retained 
see results of operations for information regarding the financial impacts of these transactions 
potential ownership changes of hotels currently under rockresorts management could result in the termination of existing rockresorts management contracts  which could negatively impact the results of operations of the lodging segment 
in may  rockresorts management agreement for casa madrona hotel and spa casa madrona in sausalito  california was terminated as the result of an ownership change of the hotel  which resulted in the company receiving a  termination fee  but loss of future management fees 
the company recorded management fees of approximately  for casa madrona for the fiscal year ended july  the company continues to pursue additional management contracts  and obtained the lodge spa at cordillera management contract in may gtlc operates three lodging properties and a variety of food and beverage  retail  camping and other services within grand teton national park under a concession contract with the national park service that expired on december  this contract was extended twice for a total of three years through december  and is currently the subject of a competitive bid process 
the national park service has indicated it expects a new concession contract to be signed by january   after which time the contract will be sent to congress for a sixty day review period 
the company cannot predict or guarantee the prospects for success in award of a new contract 
if the company is not awarded the new contract  the company s lodging reported ebitda for the periods subsequent to the date of the potential loss of the concession contract will be significantly impacted due to the historically positive reported ebitda generated by gtlc  although the company would receive proceeds for the value of its possessory interest plus any personal property and inventory sold to the new concessionaire see regulation and legislation under the business section of part i  item of this report 
the company has received approval from the vail town council for numerous lionshead development projects and is proceeding with the projects as planned

pre sale targets are set by management 
generally  the company strives to meet its pre sale targets in the period between the commencement of the marketing of a development and the planned commencement of construction 
the company has executed purchase and sale agreements for all of the gore creek place townhome units and arrabelle condominium units 
the company expects to incur between million and million of construction costs subsequent to july  on the gore creek place and arrabelle projects including the construction of related depreciable assets 
primary construction activities for these projects commenced in may  and closing on the residential units is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of fiscal for gore creek place townhomes and in late fiscal or early fiscal for arrabelle 
real estate deposits recorded as liabilities by the company were million and million as of july  and  respectively 
the company obtained non recourse financing to fund the gore creek place development in july  and plans to enter into a similar non recourse financing agreement for arrabelle 
in june  the company entered into an agreement with the ritz carlton hotel company  llc  whereby the company will develop the ritz carlton residences  vail on land adjacent to the vail marriott 
the project is planned to include up to luxury condominiums and a proposed new base village high speed chairlift 
in conjunction with this project  the company will need certain approvals  including certain regulatory approvals for the chairlift 
the development will be subject to pre sell requirements as yet to be established by the company 
real estate reported ebitda is highly dependent on  among other things  the timing of closings on real estate under contract 
changes to the anticipated timing of closing on one or more real estate units could materially impact real estate reported ebitda for a particular quarter or fiscal year 
additionally  the magnitude of real estate projects currently under development or contemplated could result in a significant increase in real estate reported ebitda as these projects close  expected in fiscal to however  future real estate reported ebitda could be adversely affected by a slow down in market demand to the extent that it has not pre sold its real estate held for sale 
impacts from the hurricane season could include increases to  among other things  fuel  commodities and construction costs and could impact travel patterns 
the company is currently unable to determine what impact  if any  the effects of the hurricanes will have on the company 
the company uses estimates to record certain reserves including  but not limited to  self insured medical and workers compensation reserves  legal liability reserves and income tax reserves and to measure assets for impairment 
if actual results vary significantly from such estimates  or if future trends are not indicative of historical experience  the company s results from operations could be materially impacted see critical accounting policies for more information regarding these reserve estimates 
remediation of the mold problem at breckenridge terrace has been substantially completed and a vast majority of the facility was re opened in november the company s estimated remaining costs are based on currently available data and do not reflect any potential reimbursement from other parties 
in september  breckenridge terrace agreed to settle its claims against certain responsible parties for  see item  legal proceedings and note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more information regarding this issue the company expects that both internal and external costs associated with compliance efforts under the sarbanes oxley act of will decrease significantly in future fiscal years from the million of expense incurred in fiscal this decrease in expense would have a favorable impact on reported ebitda for each of the company s segments 
the company is required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  in its first quarter of fiscal the full impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be reasonably estimated at this time because it will depend on levels and type of share based compensation arrangements in the future  along with the valuation model used and related assumptions 
the data provided in this section should be read in conjunction with the risk factors identified elsewhere in this document 
results of operations summary the ski season was a record year in terms of both total revenue and skier visits for the mountain segment  supported by overall increases in destination visitation and etp 
the record skier revenue and skier visitation also drove improvement in the lodging segment for properties proximate to the company s ski resorts 
in addition  management believes that the cost cutting initiatives implemented in fiscal were sustained in fiscal the company s net income of million for fiscal improved significantly over fiscal s net loss of million driven primarily by an increase in resort reported ebitda of million  a million decrease in interest expense  as well as a million decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt and a million decrease in mold remediation charges  partially offset by a million decrease in reported real estate ebitda and the fiscal net loss from the sale of businesses of million all as discussed further below 
in addition  corporate selling  general and administrative expenses corporate sg a  which are allocated between each of the three segments  increased significantly in fiscal versus fiscal due primarily to first year sox compliance costs which increased by million and increased legal costs of million 
mountain segment mountain segment operating results for the fiscal years ended july   and are presented by category as follows in thousands  except etp percentage change fiscal year ended july  increase decrease unaudited lift tickets ski school dining retail rental other total mountain net revenue total mountain operating expense mountain equity investment income  net total mountain reported ebitda total skier visits etp mountain segment revenues and reported ebitda have increased significantly since fiscal this increase is due primarily to increased lift revenues as a result of higher etp and  for fiscal  increased skier visits 
the increases in etp  which is lift revenue divided by skier visits  is a function of increased absolute pricing for both lift tickets and season passes and increased destination guest visitation driving the purchase of higher priced lift ticket products 
the absolute price increases were supported by substantial new capital improvements  including expanded grooming and snowmaking efforts and new high speed lifts 
during fiscal and continuing in fiscal  the us travel industry began to recover from the effects of the terrorist attacks of september  and the iraq war in fiscal as a result  the skier visit mix changed in fiscal and continued to change in fiscal compared to fiscal as the company experienced a higher mix of destination  including international visitors  favorably impacting skier visits and etp 
ancillary business revenues including ski school  mountain dining and retail rental increased consistent with the increase in lift ticket revenues for fiscal and ski school also benefited from an increase in absolute pricing and increased market penetration 
in addition to the impact from increased skier visits  retail rental also experienced favorable results in fiscal due to additional retail locations and an increase in ecommerce 
other factors impacting revenue were the timing of easter  which fell in march in the current fiscal year and april in fiscal and  enabling the company to maximize pricing for easter visitors in its peak month of march and an unseasonably warm month of march in fiscal  contributing to the decline in fiscal skier visits  partially offset by the loss of an extra day of peak season operations due to the leap year  and the timing of the christmas and new year s holidays  which both fell on saturday in fiscal the increase in other revenue for fiscal versus fiscal is due primarily to increased private clubs revenue from dues increases  a full year of operations of the spa at the ritz carlton  bachelor gulch and higher amortization of deferred club initiation fees due to increased memberships million  increased allocated employee housing revenue due to the re opening of a facility that closed in fiscal  increased commercial leasing revenue as a result of a full twelve months of increased available space and increased percentage rents  increased municipal services revenue due to expanded services in beaver creek and bachelor gulch villages  and a full year of consolidation of the company s four employee housing entities  which were consolidated in the second quarter of fiscal 
the increases in other revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to consolidation of employee housing entities million  increased revenues related to technology services million  operations of the spa at the ritz carlton  bachelor gulch  which opened in november million and increased summer visitation 
mountain operating expense is generally not expected to increase commensurate with an increase in revenue due to the primarily fixed cost nature of the business 
however  new initiatives to expand grooming and snowmaking caused an increase in operating costs including labor  utilities and fuel for fiscal the company also incurred incremental costs associated with the installation of additional chairlifts in fiscal in addition  fiscal allocated corporate sg a increased due to higher legal  first year sox compliance costs  operating costs associated with the re opening of breckenridge terrace  which was closed for the entire ski season last year and a full year of consolidation of the four employee housing entities of  in fiscal  the company changed its cost structure by decreasing the amount of fixed costs in the mountain segment through staffing changes  reduced marketing costs  changes in summer trail maintenance and more closely monitoring the hours of certain dining establishments 
the mountain segment also benefited from cost reductions realized in allocated corporate sg a expenses 
these changes to the cost structure helped offset increased expenses due to the consolidation of four employee housing entities million  normal cost increases associated with inflation  payroll increases and energy prices as well as increased incentive compensation 
mountain equity investment income primarily includes the company s share of income or loss from the operations of a real estate brokerage  the increase in equity investment income is due primarily to increased commissions earned by the brokerage associated with increased real estate activity in eagle county  including the company s development activities in lionshead

additionally  paid occupancy increased from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal the lodging segment s non rockresorts branded properties  which are all proximate to the company s ski resorts  and the company s rockresorts properties located in close proximity to the company s ski resorts have also benefited from the increase in skier visits and increased destination guests  and have experienced an increase in group business primarily within the vail  beaver creek and keystone properties 
management believes the increase in group business is the result of an increased focus on this segment coupled with improvements in the overall lodging industry related to economic rebound and decreased travel related concerns 
the company s rockresorts properties not located in close proximity to its ski resorts also performed favorably in fiscal along with the overall lodging industry related to economic rebound and decreased travel related concerns

significant uses of cash the company s cash needs typically include providing for operating expenditures  debt service requirements and capital expenditures for both assets to be used in operations and real estate development projects 
in addition  the company expects that beginning with the fiscal year  it will incur significant cash income tax expense generally expected to equal its statutory income tax rate 
the consolidated statement of cash flows included in the accompanying financial statements provides information with respect to the company s historical sources and uses of cash 
as indicated in the table of contractual obligations below  the company has significant cash commitments in the near term 
these commitments are primarily related to the completion of certain real estate development projects  most notably the construction of the gore creek place townhomes for an estimated million  the arrabelle project for an estimated million  the jhg tc cabins and clubhouse for an estimated million  and million in other commitments related to the company s development activities in lionshead  all of which represent obligations in the next months 
in addition to these projects  the company expects to spend approximately million to million in the remainder of calendar on capital expenditures related to real estate development projects 
the real estate capital expenditures include approximately million to million of costs for assets which will ultimately be capitalized as fixed assets 
the company expects real estate capital expenditures will be higher than historical levels for the near term as the company continues development associated with vail s new dawn 
as noted above  the company obtained non recourse financing to fund construction of the gore creek place project  the company expects to utilize similar financing arrangements for certain other development projects  including arrabelle 
in addition to utilizing project specific financing  the company also pre sells units requiring deposits in a proposed development prior to committing to the completion of the development  thereby helping to ensure sufficient funds are available to complete the project 
the company has historically invested significant cash in capital expenditures for its resort operations  and expects to continue to invest significant cash in the future 
the company believes that annual capital expenditures of approximately million to million are necessary to sustain the appearance and level of service appropriate to the company s resort operations 
the company evaluates additional capital improvements based on expected strategic impacts and or expected return on investment 
an estimated million to million is expected to be spent during the remainder of calendar under the company s capital plan 
primary projects are expected to include two new high speed chairlifts one at beaver creek and one at breckenridge  and dining facility upgrades at heavenly and vail 
the company has not finalized its capital plan for calendar the company plans to utilize cash flow from operations  cash on hand and  as necessary  borrowings under long term debt to provide the cash necessary to execute its capital plan 
principal payments on the vast majority of the company s long term debt million of the total million debt outstanding as of july  are not due until fiscal and beyond 
fiscal maturities  which total million  include million under the ssv facility  which was refinanced in september see note  long term debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report  for more information 
interest payments under the company s fixed rate debt will be approximately million in fiscal  assuming the debt remains at its current level 
the company s debt service requirements can be impacted by changing interest rates as the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding as of july  a basis point change in libor would cause the company s annual interest expense to change by approximately  the fluctuation in the company s debt service requirements  in addition to interest rate changes  may be impacted by future borrowings under its credit facility or other alternative financing arrangements it may enter into 
the company s long term liquidity needs are dependent upon operating results which impact the borrowing capacity under the credit facility  which can be mitigated by adjustments to capital expenditures  flexibility of investment activities and the ability to obtain favorable future financing 
the company manages changes in the business and economic environment by managing its capital expenditures and real estate development activities 
covenants and limitations the company must abide by certain restrictive financial covenants in relation to its bank credit facilities and the indenture 
the most restrictive of those covenants include the funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  senior debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum net worth and the interest coverage ratio each as defined in the underlying credit agreements 
in addition  the company s financing arrangements limit its ability to incur certain indebtedness  make certain restricted payments  make certain investments  make certain affiliate transfers and may limit its ability to enter into certain mergers  consolidations or sales of assets 
the company s borrowing availability under the credit facility is primarily determined by the funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  which is based on the company s segment operating performance  as defined in the credit agreement 
the company was in compliance with all relevant covenants in its debt instruments as of july  the company expects it will meet all applicable quarterly financial tests in its debt instruments  including the funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  in fiscal however  there can be no assurance that the company will meet its financial covenants 
if such covenants are not met  the company would be required to seek a waiver or amendment from the banks participating in the credit facility 
while the company anticipates that it would obtain such waiver or amendment  if any were necessary  there can be no assurance that such waiver or amendment would be granted  which could have a material adverse impact on the liquidity of the company 
capital structure in september  the company and ski partners  lp apollo entered into a conversion and registration rights agreement the agreement  pursuant to which apollo converted all of its class a common stock into the company s common shares 
apollo distributed the shares to its partners in proportion to each partner s interest in the partnership 
apollo did not dissolve after this distribution and continues to exist as a partnership 
the company  pursuant to the agreement  filed a shelf registration statement in november covering certain of the shares to be owned by the limited partners of apollo 
as a result of this agreement  the company now has only one class of directors 
previously  the class a common stock elected the class directors and the common stock elected the class directors 
contractual obligations as part of its ongoing operations  the company enters into arrangements that obligate the company to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements and debt agreements 
debt obligations  which total million  are currently recognized as liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
operating lease obligations  which total million as of july   are not recognized as liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet  which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a summary of the company s contractual obligations at the end of fiscal is as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total fiscal year years years more than years long term debt fixed rate interest operating leases and service contracts purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations the fixed rate interest payments included in the table above assume that all fixed rate debt outstanding as of july  will be held to maturity 
interest payments associated with variable rate debt have not been included in the table 
assuming that the amounts outstanding under variable rate long term debt as of july  are held to maturity  and utilizing interest rates in effect at july   the company anticipates that its annual interest payments including commitment fees and letter of credit fees on variable rate long tem debt as of july  will be in the range of million to million for at least the next five years 
the future annual interest obligations noted herein are estimated only in relation to debt outstanding as of july   and do not reflect interest obligations on potential future debt  such as non recourse financing associated with real estate development 
purchase obligations include amounts which are classified as trade payables  accrued payroll and benefits  accrued fees and assessments  accrued taxes  accrued interest  and liabilities including advances to complete real estate projects on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of july  and other obligations for goods and services not yet recorded 
other long term obligations include amounts which become due based on deficits in underlying cash flows of the metropolitan district as described in note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off balance sheet transactions that are expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company to select appropriate accounting policies and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying the company s accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which its financial status depends 
the critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the company also has other policies considered key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are complex or subjective 
real estate held for sale 
description the company utilizes the relative sales value method to determine cost of sales for individual parcels of real estate or condominium units sold within a project 
the determination of cost of sales under the relative sales value method utilizes significant estimates for both the ultimate total revenues to be generated and total costs to be incurred on a real estate development project 
real estate development projects generally span several years 
additionally  the percentage of completion method is used for revenue recognition on real estate sales for which the company has not completed its obligations to the buyer at the time of closing 
this requires estimation of the total cost to complete the obligations to determine the amount of revenue and cost of sales to recognize on a periodic basis 
judgments and uncertainties changes to cost of sales percentages for a project based upon changes in the estimates are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis for past sales  other changes are accounted for on a prospective basis 
as a result  changes in the estimates underlying the cost of sales calculation can cause significant variances in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue applied year to year throughout the life of a project effect if actual results differ from assumptions a change in the estimates for future revenues or costs yet to be incurred as of july  would have changed the profit margin recognized by approximately  for the fiscal year ended july  a change in the cost to complete the projects accounted for under the percentage of completion method and recorded through fiscal would have changed cost of sales by approximately  for the fiscal year ended july  workers compensation 
description the company is self insured for workers compensation for its operations in the states of colorado and california 
workers compensation claims are reserved based on actuarial estimates for the ultimate development of existing claims and claims incurred but not yet reported 
judgments and uncertainties variances in actual claims experience versus the actuarial reserve can affect the timing of workers compensation expense between fiscal years 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a change in the estimated development factors for fiscal claims would have changed fiscal workers compensation expense recognized by approximately  deferred club initiation fees 
description revenues from club initiation fees are initially deferred and recognized over the expected life of the club facilities 
judgments and uncertainties the life of the club facilities is an estimate determined by management based on consideration of standard building life estimates 
changes in the estimates of the club facilities lives do not impact the aggregate amount of club related revenues recognized  however  the changes would impact the timing of the revenue recognition 
if an estimate is changed  the remaining club revenues would be recognized in a straight line pattern over the new estimated remaining life of the club facilities 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the estimated remaining lives of all of the company s private club facilities were shortened by five years as of august   fiscal revenue would have increased approximately  similarly  if the estimated lives had been extended by five years as of august   fiscal revenue would have decreased approximately  intangible assets 
description the company frequently obtains intangible assets  including goodwill  primarily through business combinations 
the assignment of value to individual intangible assets generally requires the assistance of a specialist  such as an appraiser 
the assumptions used in the appraisal process are forward looking  and thus are subject to significant interpretation 
because individual intangible assets i may be expensed immediately upon acquisition  ii amortized over their estimated useful life  or iii not amortized  the assigned values and lives  when applicable  could have a material effect on current and future period results of operations 
further  intangibles are subject to certain judgments when evaluating impairment pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  discussed further in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually for impairment under sfas no 
as of may  or whenever events may indicate a possible impairment exists 
future operating results could dictate significant future non cash impairment charges 
judgments and uncertainties the company determines fair value using current market values and widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and a royalty rate model 
these types of analyses require the company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding economic factors and the future operating results of certain business operations 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions the company completed the annual impairment testing of intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which resulted in no impairment being recorded  using the methodology described herein 
a decrease in the estimated fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets tested would not have had a significant impact on the test results 
income taxes 
description the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process requires the company to estimate the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent recovery is not likely  must establish a valuation allowance 
this assessment is complicated by the fact that the company files its tax return on a calendar year basis which is different from its fiscal year end 
as of july   the company had total deferred tax assets of million before valuation allowances and total deferred tax liabilities of million 
the net deferred tax asset contains a valuation allowance representing the portion that management does not believe will be recovered from future taxable income 
management believes that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future  primarily through the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities  to realize the benefit of the company s deferred tax assets for which valuation allowances have not been recorded against 
judgments and uncertainties the company has approximately million tax effected of net operating loss and other carryforwards and credits as of july  for which it has not recorded a valuation allowance against 
the company is primarily relying on the reversal of deferred tax liabilities to utilize these carryforwards and credits 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the company were to incur substantial tax losses for a number of years  the carryforwards and credits for which it has not recorded a valuation allowance against could expire without being utilized resulting in an increased tax expense in the period that the company believes that it more likely than not the carryforwards or credits will not be realized 
tax contingencies 
description the company is subject to periodic review by domestic tax authorities for audit of the company s income tax returns 
these audits generally include questions regarding the company s tax filing positions  including the amount and timing of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with the company s various tax filing positions  including state and local taxes  the company recorded reserves for probable exposure 
a significant amount of time may pass before a particular matter  for which the company may have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
as of the end of fiscal  three open years were undergoing examination by the internal revenue service 
judgments and uncertainties the estimates of the company s tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the potential exposure associated with the company s various filing positions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable and it has adequate reserves for its tax contingencies  actual results could differ  and the company may be exposed to increases or decreases in those reserves that could be material 
to the extent the company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established  or is required to pay amounts in excess of the company s reserve  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require the use of cash and could possibly result in an increased tax expense and effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement could possibly result in a reduction in the company s tax expense and effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based compensation arrangements to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based compensation arrangements granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures for either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company plans to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based compensation arrangements to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will impact the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
the adoption of sfas r will increase the company s operating expenses by approximately million  million and  for the years ended july   and  respectively  for options that remain unvested as of july  the full impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be reasonably estimated at this time because it will depend on levels and type of share based compensation arrangements in the future  along with the valuation model used and related assumptions 
however  had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss per share in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  the company granted approximately  shares of restricted stock and options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the vesting period for the restricted stock ranges from one to three years  and the vesting period for the stock options is three years 
the company is currently evaluating the effect these share based compensation arrangements will have on its future results of operations 
inflation although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on its operations  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
when the costs of operating resorts increase  the company generally has been able to pass the increase on to its customers 
however  there can be no assurance that increases in labor and other operating costs due to inflation will not have an impact on the company s future profitability 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s mountain and lodging operations are seasonal in nature 
in particular  revenues and profits for the company s mountain and most of its lodging operations are substantially lower and historically result in losses from late spring to late fall 
conversely  peak operating seasons for gtlc  certain managed hotel properties and the company s owned golf courses occur during the summer months while the winter season generally results in operating losses 
however  revenues and profits generated by gtlc s summer operations  management fees from those managed properties and golf operations are not sufficient to fully offset the company s off season losses from its mountain and other lodging operations 
during the fiscal year  of total combined mountain and lodging revenues were earned during the second and third fiscal quarters 
quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of snowfall and other unforeseen external factors 
therefore  the operating results for any three month period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
see note  selected quarterly financial data  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
economic downturn skiing  travel and tourism are discretionary recreational activities that can be adversely affected by a significant economic slowdown  which  in turn  could reduce the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that a continued or future decrease in the amount of discretionary spending by the public would not have an adverse effect on the company 
unfavorable weather conditions the ability to attract visitors to ski resorts is influenced by weather conditions and by the amount and timing of snowfall during the ski season 
unfavorable weather conditions can adversely affect skier visits and the company s revenues and profits 
in the past years  the company s colorado ski resorts have averaged between and feet of annual snowfall and heavenly receives average yearly snowfall of between and feet  significantly in excess of the average for united states ski resorts 
however  there is no assurance that the company s resorts will receive seasonal snowfalls near the historical average in the future 
also  the early season snow conditions and skier perceptions of early season snow conditions influence the momentum and success of the overall season 
in addition  a severe and prolonged drought could affect our otherwise adequate snowmaking water supplies 
unfavorable weather conditions such as drought  hurricanes  tropical storms and tornadoes can adversely affect the company s other resorts and lodging properties as vacationers tend to delay or postpone vacations if weather conditions differ from those that typically prevail at such resorts for a given season 
there is no way for the company to predict future weather patterns or the impact that weather patterns may have on results of operations or visitation 
to some extent  the company mitigates against impacts from weather through the sales of season passes 
labor market the company s mountain and lodging operations are largely dependent on a seasonal workforce 
the company recruits worldwide to fill staffing needs each season and utilizes visas to enable the use of foreign workers 
in addition  the company manages seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place 
while the company does not currently foresee the need to increase seasonal wages to attract employees  the company cannot guarantee that such an increase will not be necessary in the future 
in addition  the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to obtain the visas necessary to hire foreign workers who are an important source for the seasonal workforce 
increased seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations  however  the company is unable to predict with any certainty whether such situations will arise or the potential impact on results of operations 
terrorist acts upon the united states and acts of war the terrorist acts carried out against the united states on september  and the war with iraq and its aftermath have had an adverse effect on the global travel and leisure industry 
additional terrorist acts against the united states and the threat of or actual war by or upon the united states could result in further degradation of discretionary travel  upon which the company s operations are highly dependent 
such degradation could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk is limited primarily to the fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness 
at july   the company had million of variable rate indebtedness  representing of the company s total debt outstanding  at an average interest rate during fiscal of 
the company s average interest rate includes letter of credit fees  unused fees and deferred financing charges see note  long term debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
based on floating rate borrowings outstanding as of july   a basis point change in libor would have caused the company s annual interest expense to change by  respectively
