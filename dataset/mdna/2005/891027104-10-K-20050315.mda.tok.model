item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and r esults of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance  and to a limited extent annuities  to middle income households throughout the united states 
torchmark views its operations by segments  which are the major insurance product lines of life  health and annuities  and the investment segment that supports the product lines 
segments are aligned based on their common characteristics  comparability of the profit margins  and management techniques used to operate each segment 
insurance product line segments 
as fully described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the product line segments involve the marketing  underwriting and benefit administration of policies 
each product line is comprised of the various distribution units that market the insurance policies 
whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole  or the individual distribution units within the segment  the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin  which is premium revenue reduced by policy benefit obligations and policy acquisition expenses 
underwriting margin is useful to management in evaluating the performance of the insurance product line segments and their underlying distribution units because each distribution unit tends to operate in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that niche 
these measures enable management to view period to period trends and make informed decisions regarding future courses of action 
investment segment 
the investment segment involves the management of torchmark s capital resources  including the investment of cash generated from operations in appropriate investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity 
torchmark s measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income  which is income earned on the investment portfolio less the interest credited to net policy liabilities and less the company s financing costs 
the tables in note business segments demonstrate the measures of profitability 
those tables also reconcile torchmark s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three year period ending december  additionally  this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year to year comparability and which reconciles to torchmark s net income 
that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present torchmark s overall operations in the manner that management uses to manage the business

torchmark s operations on a segment by segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 
summary of operations torchmark s net income increased or million to million in  and or million to million in the growth in earnings in both periods came primarily from the life insurance and investment segments  although health contributed in  due to improvement in margins 
the investment contribution was less in than in the prior year 
the life insurance segment added million to the increase in earnings  and million to the increase 
life insurance growth has been a result of increases in sales volumes  premium and improvements in margins in both and  and is discussed further under the caption life insurance 
pretax health profits rose million in to million after having declined by million to million in health premium income rose in both and growth in health premium has been limited in recent periods because of competitive pressures in torchmark s medicare supplement business 
health sales  as represented by premium collected in the first policy year  rose in  after increasing in health underwriting margin improved in  primarily as a result of reductions in loss ratios on a closed block of cancer business 
this block had contributed to declines in margins in recent years prior to see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 
the annuity segment profits have been adversely affected by replacement activity of torchmark s policies by a former distributor 
torchmark has previously stated that it will offer annuities  but does not plan to emphasize annuity products  favoring life insurance instead 
see the caption annuities for further discussion 
the investment segment s pretax profitability increased million in and million in the decline in the increase in profitability is the result of the low and falling interest rate environment during the period 
the investment segment includes net investment income  offset by interest on insurance liabilities and financing costs 
yields on new investments averaging have been lower than the portfolio yield of since the first quarter of as a result  net investment income has grown at a lower rate than the corresponding growth rate in invested assets 
additionally  proceeds from called or matured bonds totaling billion in were invested at yields lower than that of the replaced bonds 
lower interest rates credited to the insurance liabilities and benefits from the interest rate swaps on torchmark s debt have somewhat mitigated the effect of lower interest rates on the investment segment  but the net effect has been detrimental 
see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments for a more detailed discussion 
total revenues rose in to billion  exceeding billion for the first time in torchmark s history 
in  total revenues increased to billion from billion in the life premium increase was the primary contributor to revenue growth in both periods  accounting for over half of the revenue growth each year 
net investment income added of the revenue growth in and in under the caption realized gains and losses in the report  torchmark presents a complete analysis and discussion of its realized gains and losses 
as also explained under that caption  torchmark management does not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of its core insurance operations 
however  they can have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
in  torchmark had after tax realized investment gains of million compared with losses of million in and losses of million in realized gains and losses in all periods were favorably impacted by the effects of torchmark s interest rate swap derivatives  which  as explained in the following paragraph  are included in realized gains and losses 
writedowns of investments due to the deterioration in credit quality of certain investments had a negative impact in each period  particularly in as also explained under the discussion of realized gains and losses  torchmark views the benefit of the reduced interest cost resulting from the swap of its fixed rate interest obligations to variable rates as a reduction in interest costs 
in addition to the beneficial impact on earnings from this interest cost differential due to these swaps  gaap rules also require that all derivatives including torchmark s swaps must be valued at market value with period to period changes reflected in earnings 
in accordance with gaap  these changes in value are treated as realized gains and losses 
in  the securities and exchange commission informally interpreted the gaap rules affecting the reporting of torchmark s swap instruments stating that all income and expenses related to non hedged derivatives must be reported in the same line item as the required fair value adjustment 
to comply with this interpretation  torchmark reports the interest expense reduction on all of its swap derivatives in its consolidated statements of operations as a realized investment gain  not as a reduction in interest expense 
torchmark continues to report this interest savings as a reduction in interest cost in its segment analysis and in its management s discussion  as gaap requires the segment disclosures to be as torchmark manages its investment segment 
in and  torchmark s net income was affected by certain significant  unusual  and nonrecurring items 
torchmark management does not view these items as components of its core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations 
a discussion of these items follows 
during  torchmark received a refund of state income taxes in the amount of million  after federal tax 
this refund resulted from the settlement of certain state tax issues concerning a discontinued operation in the mid s and reduced income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
in  net income was impacted by two nonrecurring items 
first  torchmark sold an airplane and recognized a pretax loss of 
million 
in the consolidated statements of operations  this item was included as an administrative expense 
secondly  the settlement of a federal tax issue resulted in interest due torchmark in the pretax amount of million 
this item was included in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations 
because the tax issue covered a period of many years  the interest income on the tax refund exceeded the refund itself 
after expenses  the effect of the tax refund on earnings was immaterial 
significant gains or losses from non investment property or significant interest income from non investment sources are unusual for torchmark 
torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in and was reaffirmed at its july  board of director s meeting 
with no specified authorization amount  management determines the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company s excess cash flow  general market conditions  and other alternative uses 
the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable 
additionally  when stock options are exercised  proceeds from these exercises are used to repurchase approximately the number of dilutive shares issued as a result of the option exercises 
the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december  analysis of share purchases amounts in millions purchases shares amount shares amount shares amount excess cash flow option proceeds total throughout the remainder of this discussion  share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow 
a discussion of each of torchmarks segments follows 
life insurance 
life insurance is torchmark s largest insurance segment 
its premium is also growing at a greater rate than the other insurance segments 
in  life premium represented of total premium  compared with in and in life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented of the total in  compared with in and in additionally  investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 
life insurance premium rose to billion in and in to billion 
life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels 
premium by channel for each of the last three years is as follows 
life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in millions amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency military agency other agencies torchmark management uses two statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term  annualized premium in force and first year collected premium 
annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the next twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the period 
annualized premium in force is an indicator of growth in premium revenue 
first year collected premium is a measure of sales  and is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year 
first year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur  and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium in force due to new sales 
the following table sets forth annualized life insurance premium in force information for each of the last three years by distribution method 
life insurance annualized premium in force by distribution method dollar amounts in millions amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency military agency other agencies the table below discloses first year collected life premium by distribution channel 
life insurance first year collected premium by distribution method dollar amounts in millions amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency military agency other agencies the direct response group is torchmark s leading writer of life insurance 
marketing is conducted primarily through direct mail  but also through co op mailings  television and consumer magazine advertising  and direct mail solicitations endorsed by groups  unions and associations 
this group markets a line of life products primarily to juveniles  their parents  and other adults over age the direct response operation accounted for almost of torchmark s life insurance premium during life premium rose in and in at december   life annualized premium in force was million  which represented of torchmark s total  the largest of any distribution group 
life insurance annualized premium in force rose in after growing in growth in premium income and annualized premium in force resulted from strong sales of direct response products in each period  as evidenced by the increases in first year collections of to million in and to million in these increases in first year collections were the largest of any life distribution group in either period 
the growth in sales is largely attributable to this group s focus on its juvenile life product 
this product was recently recharacterized as a larger face amount product with a higher annual premium  and has been a successful product for this market 
not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales  but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile insureds 
parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a solicitation by direct response for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population 
also  both the juveniles and their parents are low acquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 
torchmark expects that sales to the juvenile market and their parents will continue as one of this group s premier markets 
management believes that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct response life insurance 
the american income exclusive agency focuses on members of labor unions  credit unions  and other associations for its life insurance sales 
it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios 
this agency was torchmark s fastest growing life insurance agency during both and in terms of premium income and annualized premium in force  but growth slowed in annualized life premium in force rose to million at year end  after having increased in  while premium income rose in and in sales  in terms of first year collected premium  grew in  after having risen in and in growth in sales for this agency is driven by the growth in the number of its agents 
american income s agent count was  at year end  growing to  at year end and to  at year end in  however  the agent count fell to  at december as in the case of all of torchmark s agency distribution systems  continued increases in sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count 
american income s marketing organization has renewed its efforts to improve agent recruiting  retention  and productivity in order to increase the size of this agency 
in particular  this agency began in the third quarter of to focus on updating its internet recruiting program in an effort to add new agents 
in the fourth quarter of  the agent count increased  primarily as a result of these efforts 
the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system markets primarily to middle income markets in several southeastern states 
liberty s life premium was flat in compared with at million 
in  life premium grew over the prior year 
annualized life premium in force was million at december   declining in after having risen in life premium sales for this agency  in terms of first year collected premium  was flat in each of the years through at million 
growth in sales and premium volume are highly dependent on growth in the agency force 
liberty had  agents at year end  compared with  at year end and  at year end these counts represent a decrease of in and were essentially flat in the count of renewal agents  those agents that have been with liberty for more than one year  declined to at year end but rose to by year end renewal agents are generally higher producers than first year agents 
in the latter part of  the agent s compensation system was restructured to not only reward production  but also to encourage retention of productive agents 
however  the recruiting of new agents declined 
in the third quarter of  liberty implemented initiatives similar to those of american income to recruit new agents  primarily through use of the internet 
as a result  total agent count rose or during the fourth quarter of management believes that the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to growing the sales in controlled agency distribution systems 
liberty s life underwriting margins rose in the period over the prior year period from to of premium 
these margin improvements resulted primarily from the reductions in acquisition costs due to the revisions in agents compensation 
improved persistency resulting from a change in collection procedure was also a factor in the margin improvements 
torchmark s military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised of former commissioned and noncommissioned military officers who sell exclusively to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families 
this business consists of whole life products with term insurance riders and is characterized by low lapse rates 
the military agency has steadily grown 
in  life premium was million or of torchmark s total life premium 
premium rose in both and this agency continues to grow  as annualized premium in force rose in to million after an increase in of 
one key to the growth of premium income and premium in force in this agency is the high persistency of the business 
sales of this agency grew in terms of first year premium collected in to million  after a increase in margins in the military group were negatively affected by hostilities in the middle east in and  resulting in additional benefits paid of million and million  respectively 
torchmark s other agencies consist of the united investors agency  the united american independent and branch office agencies  and other small miscellaneous sales agencies 
the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business 
prior to  united investors distribution was primarily through the sales representatives of a former torchmark subsidiary that was spun off in united investors terminated the agency contract with that organization in the loss of that sales group has had a negative impact on production in the united investors agency 
the united american independent and branch office agencies combined represented approximately of other agency premium in  or of the torchmark total 
life premium for these agencies has been relatively flat for the past three years  because these two agencies focus on health insurance  with life sales being incidental 
life insurance summary of results dollar amounts in millions amount of premium amount of premium amount of premium premium and policy charges   policy obligations required interest on reserves net policy obligations commissions and premium taxes amortization of acquisition costs total expense insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses gross margins  as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense  rose in both and over the respective prior year 
as a percentage of life insurance premium  gross margins have increased each year 
improvements in life margins have resulted from several factors 
the previously mentioned changes in liberty s agent compensation system and premium collection method have contributed to notable increases in liberty s margins 
additionally  the percentage of american income premium to total premium continues to grow  and that has caused life margins to increase because that agency s margins are torchmark s highest at 
direct response margins have grown to above  as it has emphasized sales of its juvenile policy  a higher margin product 
health insurance 
torchmark markets its supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels 
health premium represented of torchmark s total premium income in health underwriting margin accounted for of the total 
the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years

health insurance annualized premium in force by product dollar amounts in millions amount of total amount of total amount of total medicare supplement cancer other limited benefit plans total at december   medicare supplement accounted for of torchmark s annualized health premium in force compared with in and in medicare supplement annualized premium in force declined as a percentage of total annualized health premium in force  reflective of the changes in product mix in sales of health products  as greater emphasis has been placed on sales of other limited benefit plans 
the medicare supplement market has become more difficult in recent periods due to regulatory pressures and increased competition  resulting in declines in sales and premium in force for this product 
while medicare supplement still remains torchmark s dominant health product in terms of annualized premium  hospital surgical products have been growing rapidly in their contribution to health premium 
this product line has risen from of annualized health premium in force in to in the following table indicates first year collected premium by health product type for each of the last three years 
health insurance first year collected premium by product dollar amounts in millions amount of total amount of total amount of total medicare supplement cancer other limited benefit plans total the united american branch office and independent agencies are the predominant distributors of torchmark s health products 
these agencies accounted for million or of health premium income and million or of first year collected premium 
historically  medicare supplement has been the primary product sold by these agencies 
however  in recent periods  medicare supplement sales have not been emphasized by these two agencies as their focus has shifted to distributing limited benefit hospital surgical policies sold to customers under age medicare supplement sales have been under pressure for the last several years from increased price competition and  as the average price of the most popular plans has increased rapidly in the past years  affordability has become an issue for some seniors 
both factors have increased the difficulty for agents making sales of medicare supplements 
accordingly  these agencies have expanded their product lines as increased consumer demand for under age supplemental health products has resulted from the growing unavailability of individual major medical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers 
not only did the price competition make sales more difficult  but  additionally  many of the united american branch office agents left torchmark for competitors whose lower priced medicare supplement products were easier to sell 
this trend of agent losses reversed in  as this agency began to focus on other supplemental health products and as torchmark s medicare supplement premium rate increases have moderated 
producing agents at the united american branch office agency declined to  at year end but then rose in to  in  this count rose to  at year end 
medicare supplement first year collected premium fell in to million from million in in  medicare supplement first year collections were down from million the prior year 
even though price competition has been a negative factor  torchmark intends to continue to market its medicare supplement product as a major health product offering 
medicare beneficiaries represent a large and growing group of potential customers 
even though margins in this product are limited due to heavy regulation  standardized benefit plans  compensation limitations to agents  and mandated loss ratios  it still remains a profitable product to torchmark 
medicare supplement policies are highly regulated at both the federal and state levels with standardized benefit plans  limits on first year agent compensation  and mandated minimum loss ratios 
other regulatory issues continue to affect the medicare supplement market 
medical cost inflation and changes to the medicare program necessitate annual rate increases  which generally require state insurance department approval 
the medicare program is constantly being studied and reviewed by congress and the executive branch  with changes in the program expected from time to time 
however  medicare supplements remain a popular supplemental health policy with the country s large and growing group of medicare beneficiaries 
about of all medicare beneficiaries have medicare supplements to cover at least some portion of the deductibles and coinsurance that the federal medicare program does not pay 
because of minimum loss ratio regulation  underwriting margins on medicare supplements are lower than those on torchmark s life business 
however  due to united american s low cost  service oriented customer assistance and claims administration  as well as its economies of scale  it is a profitable line of business 
in  congress passed legislation that in will provide medicare covered prescription drugs  a benefit not previously covered by medicare 
while this is a major addition to the medicare program  it will have little effect on torchmark s medicare supplement business because the legislation does not require medicare supplements to cover the co pays and deductibles that the medicare drug program does not cover 
torchmark does not write any medicare supplement plans that provide prescription drug coverage 
at this time  it appears that there will continue to be an important role for private insurers such as torchmark in helping senior citizens cover their healthcare costs 
as a result  medicare supplements should continue as a popular product for senior age consumers 
as discussed above  the united american agencies have emphasized sales of other limited benefit health products for which demand has increased in recent years 
consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability of individual major medical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers 
margins on these other supplemental health plans are generally higher than those of medicare supplement 
however  the medicare supplement product has higher persistency rates 
both of the united american agencies offer these limited benefit plans 
most of the plans being written are limited benefit hospital and surgical plans that are lower cost alternatives to individual major medical plans  or that are bought to supplement employer sponsored group health plans 
because of the limits on maximum benefits and other limits  these type plans are relatively less subject to the high rate increases that have been experienced in major medical type plans 
sales of other limited benefit health products  in terms of first year collected premium  rose in to million over million in annualized premium in force for other health products grew in to million  after rising in to million 
cancer business is primarily produced by the liberty national agency 
cancer annualized premium in force represented of torchmark s total health premium in force at december  annualized premium in force declined in but rose in approximately one half of the total cancer annualized premium in force consists of a closed block of cancer business which arose from a class action settlement in the mid nineties 
significant rate increases to offset deteriorating margins on this closed block of business have been a continuing factor affecting growth in cancer premium in force in prior periods 
cancer sales  in terms of first year collected premium  were million in  above million sold in first year collections in increased over the prior year 
health insurance summary of results dollar amounts in millions amount of premium amount of premium amount of premium premium    policy obligations required interest on reserves net policy obligations commissions and premium taxes amortization of acquisition costs total expense insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense increased in from million to million 
in  health underwriting income declined from million in as a percentage of premium  underwriting income before other income and administrative expense rose in to  largely as a result of the reduced loss ratios in the previously mentioned closed block of cancer business at liberty 
in recent years  this block of business has experienced high loss ratios even though frequent premium rate increases have been implemented 
the high loss ratios have been a result of increased claim costs due to the additional benefits required in the class action settlements 
as a percentage of premium  health margin declined from in to in and to in  a downtrend primarily caused by the growing loss ratios of this block 
the company recently announced that it has reached an agreement with parties in a class action lawsuit roberts v 
liberty national life insurance company related to this block of business 
see part  item legal proceedings  the settlement provides for claims incurred after the effective date of the settlement in early march to be paid on an actual incurred basis  rather than a billed basis  which management estimates will reduce benefits paid going forward 
it also provides for a grandfathered period for certain claimants that will allow them to be paid at billed rates for one year 
the settlement also requires liberty to reduce premiums and to maintain an claims loss ratio over the remaining life of the business 
as a result  premiums are estimated to decline from about million per year prior to the settlement to about million in force when the settlement is fully phased in  assuming no lapsed policies 
prior to the settlement  liberty has had a claims loss ratio above on this block 
annuities 
annuity products are marketed by torchmark subsidiaries to service a variety of consumer needs  including retirement income and long term  tax deferred growth opportunities 
annuities are sold on both a fixed and variable basis 
annuities represented of torchmark s premium revenue and less than of insurance underwriting margin 
while torchmark continues to market annuity products  it does not emphasize this segment 
annuities summary of results dollar amounts in millions policy charges policy obligations required interest on reserves net policy obligations commissions and premium taxes amortization of acquisition costs total expense insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses annuity policy charges have declined in each period  as the average annuity account balance  upon which the majority of charges were based  has declined 
annuity underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses rose to million in  even though policy charges declined in the primary factor in this increase was the reduction in policy obligations resulting from the decline in guaranteed minimum death benefits from million in to million in due to higher equity markets in when compared with the prior year 
a significant portion of product profitability of fixed annuities is derived from the spread of investment income earned versus contractual interest requirements credited to the policies 
because this interest spread exceeds policy benefit obligations  net policy obligations result in a negative balance and increase underwriting margin 
underwriting margins declined from million in to million in the decline resulted from the decline in the average annuity account balance even though the end of year balance rose in guaranteed minimum death benefits increased slightly in from million 
administrative expenses 
torchmark s operating expenses  as included in the other and corporate segments  are classified in two categories insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company 
consider the following information for the three years ended december  operating expenses selected information dollar amounts in millions insurance administrative expenses parent company expense total operating expenses insurance administrative expenses increase over prior year expense as percentage of premium total operating expenses increase over prior year expense as percentage of revenue insurance administrative expenses exclude thousand nonrecurring loss on sale of aircraft equipment in revenues include realized gains of million in  and losses of million in and million in revenues in also include a nonrecurring interest income benefit of million related to interest received on a tax settlement 
because realized gains and losses and nonrecurring items bear no relationship to core operations  torchmark management removes the effect of these items from revenue when evaluating expense ratios 
insurance administrative expenses as a percentage of premium and total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue rose slightly in but held steady in versus litigation expense in increased million  affecting the increase 
increases in were mainly a result of an increase in pension expense of million and slightly higher litigation expense 
investments 
the following table summarizes torchmark s investment income and excess investment income 
analysis of excess investment income dollar amounts in millions except for per share data net investment income reclassification of interest amount due to deconsolidation interest from tax settlements adjusted investment income per segment analysis interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities interest on reserves interest on deferred acquisition costs net required financing costs excess investment income excess investment income per diluted share mean invested assets at amortized cost average net insurance policy liabilities average debt and preferred securities at amortized cost see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the investment segment is responsible for the management of capital resources including investments  debt and cash flow 
excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations 
it is the measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
it is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs 
management also views excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment 
it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding  representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company 
since  torchmark has used over billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares under its ongoing share repurchase program after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives 
share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest bearing assets  but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding 
in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis  management believes that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 
excess investment income rose in to million 
it increased in and in excess investment income per diluted share increased in to per share from per share 
it increased in and in growth in excess investment income is impacted by increases in investment income due to the growth in the portfolio and changes in rates available in financial markets 
it is also affected by crediting rates on policy liabilities and changes in torchmark s borrowing costs 
additionally  share purchases in recent periods have caused excess investment income per share to grow faster than excess investment income 
the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income  which rose to million in and to million in included in investment income was a nonrecurring interest income item resulting from a tax settlement of million pretax 
after excluding the nonrecurring item  as management views investment income  investment income rose in and in  while mean invested assets at book value grew in both periods 
the decline in the growth rate of investment income is the result of falling investment interest rates for the period beginning with the second quarter of through as a result  the average yield on new investment acquisitions during that period was below the total portfolio yield 
further  calls on fixed maturity securities in the portfolio increased during the period  and the yield on the reinvestment of the proceeds was below that of the called securities 
given the sizable annual cash flow from torchmark s operations  management expects mean invested assets to continue to grow  but as long as the current low interest rate environment continues  the rate of growth of investment income will be under pressure 
more information about investment acquisitions follows under this caption 
excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt 
information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table 
interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities dollar amounts in millions interest credited average net insurance policy liabilities average crediting rate life and health annuity total increase in life and health annuity total increase in life and health annuity total increase in excess investment income has been positively affected by reduced crediting rates on certain policy liabilities in both periods 
while interest credited increased to million in  the increase in average net policy liabilities in was partially offset by the decline in crediting rates from to 
the increase in interest credited in resulted from the increase in average net liabilities  offset by a reduction in the average crediting rate to from 
as discussed under the caption annuities  the growth in net policy liabilities in was primarily due to the annuity production from a new united american general agency and the transfers from united investor variable policies to fixed annuities due to the deteriorating equity markets 
the lower average crediting rates in both and resulted from reductions made by the company in response to the low interest rate environment 
financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on torchmark s various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income 
the table below reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations to financing costs 
reconciliation of interest expense to financing costs amounts in millions interest expense per consolidated statements of operations reclassification of interest amount due to deconsolidation benefit from interest rate swaps financing costs see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements

the table below presents the components of financing costs 
analysis of financing costs amounts in millions interest on funded debt interest on short term debt other reclassification of interest amount due to deconsolidation subtotal of interest expense benefit from interest rate swaps financing costs financing costs rose or million in the increase primarily resulted from the expiration in september of a profitable interest rate swap  on which torchmark had earned over million per quarter during the first three quarters of the interest rate swaps are agreements between torchmark and certain banks for which torchmark receives from the banks fixed rate payments that match the coupons that it pays to its debt holders  and makes floating rate payments based on libor rates to the banks 
while new swaps were entered into in august of  the spreads on the new swaps were not as great as the expired swap and accounted for slightly more than million of reduced interest cost per quarter 
also affecting financing costs in were rising short term rates in the latter part of the year 
these rising rates reduced the positive effect of torchmark s other swaps and increased short term borrowing costs 
financing costs declined in the significant decline in short term interest rates from those of was a factor in the decline as it reduced short term borrowing costs in and it favorably impacted the benefit of torchmark s interest rate swaps 
a full description of these swaps is disclosed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
torchmark s investment strategy is to maintain a positive spread between yields on investments and the company s required yield on policy and financing costs 
it is this positive spread that results in excess investment income 
at the same time  torchmark desires to invest predominately in investment grade quality corporate fixed maturities 
in prolonged periods of low interest rates  maintaining sufficient spread while limiting new investments to high quality becomes more challenging 
because torchmark s policy liabilities are very long term in nature with predominantly fixed crediting rates  a low rate environment must exist for a considerable period of time before any meaningful negative impact will be made on the spread 
nevertheless  torchmark has addressed this issue in the recent periods of declining rates by lengthening maturities of new investment purchases to maximize the yield and revising the crediting rates on various products 
the chart below presents selected information about torchmark s fixed maturity acquisitions in the years through investment grade corporate securities include both bonds and trust preferred securities classified as redeemable preferred stocks with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors 
both yield and average life calculations on new purchases on noncallable bonds are based on the maturity date 
in the case of callable bonds  the average life is based on the call date or maturity date  whichever produces the lowest yield yield to worst 
fixed maturity acquisitions selected information dollar amounts in millions for the year cost of acquisitions investment grade corporate securities other investment grade securities below investment grade securities total fixed maturity acquisitions average yield effective annual yield average life in years  to worst call as rates have declined in recent periods  torchmark has attempted to maximize yield on new investments by lengthening maturities as shown above 
management believes that the long term  fixed rate characteristics of its policy liabilities do not result in negative asset and liability matching 
in years prior to  torchmark was able to maintain yields in excess of on new acquisitions of investment grade bonds 
in and in  however  yields at this level were unavailable for investment grade bonds due to the lower interest rate environment 
as a result  new money was invested at an average effective yield of in and in in addition to the investment of new cash flow  the lower yield environment during this period also impacted torchmark as calls by issuers of securities have accelerated 
issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they can refinance them at a lower cost 
these calls cause torchmark to replace higher yielding bonds with those available at lower prevailing yields 
for the period  bonds at a book value of million were called yielding an average of 
as long as the current yields on new fixed maturity acquisitions remain at or below those of the period  the overall yield on the investment portfolio will slowly decline as will investment income and excess investment income 
torchmark has taken steps to minimize the potential impact of lower rates maximizing the yield on investment grade fixed maturity acquisitions by lengthening the life of acquisitions  reducing crediting rates on certain policy liabilities  and using interest rate swap agreements to offset some of its fixed rate debt 
management believes its strategy to mitigate the lower interest rate environment is appropriate  and with the sizeable annual cash flow generated from operations  the company will be well positioned when investment interest rates eventually rebound 
torchmark s emphasis has been on bond investments over investments in equities  mortgages  or real estate 
therefore  the relative percentage of torchmark s investments by type continues to vary from industry norms 
the following table presents a comparison of torchmark s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december  with the latest industry data

torchmark calculates the average life and duration of the fixed maturity portfolio two ways based on the same date used to calculate the yield  which is the worst call date for callable bonds and the maturity date for all other bonds  and based on the maturity date of all bonds  whether callable or not 
at the end of both and  the fixed maturity portfolio had a gross unrealized gain of million 
gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities were million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
credit risk sensitivity 
credit risk is the level of certainty that a security s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity 
in weak economic periods  the securities of industry sectors affected by the economic downturn suffer increased credit risk 
as a result  securities in these weakened sectors could be downgraded by credit rating agencies to below investment grade status 
thus  the likelihood the issuers will honor their securities terms is reduced and the securities market values can be negatively impacted 
as torchmark continues to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities  credit risk is a concern 
torchmark mitigates this ongoing risk  in part  by acquiring investment grade bonds  and by investigating the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer 
torchmark continues to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis 
at december   approximately of invested assets at fair value were held in fixed maturity securities 
the major rating agencies considered of this portfolio to be investment grade 
the average quality rating of the portfolio continues to be bbb 
the table below demonstrates the credit rankings of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio at fair value as of december  rating amounts in millions aaa aa a  bbb  bb b less than b not rated torchmark s current investment policy is to acquire only investment grade obligations 
thus  any increases in below investment grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 
torchmark additionally reduces credit risk by maintaining investments in a wide range of industry sectors 
the following table presents the industry sectors that exceeded of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio at fair value at december  industry depository institutions insurance carriers electric  gas  sanitation services nondepository credit institutions finance communications chemicals allied products transportation equipment oil gas extraction food kindred products petroleum refining related industries media industrial  commercial machinery  computer equipment otherwise  no individual industry represented or more of torchmark s corporate fixed maturities 
market risk sensitivity 
market risk is the risk that the value of a security will change because of a change in market conditions 
torchmark s primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk  which is the risk that a change in a security s value could occur because of a change in interest rates 
unrealized changes in value caused by changes in interest rates are significant to torchmark s investment portfolio because its fixed maturity holdings at amortized cost represent approximately of total investments and of its total assets 
the effects of interest rate fluctuations on fixed investments are reflected on an after tax basis in torchmark s shareholders equity because these investments are marked to fair value under sfas the actual interest rate risk to torchmark is reduced because the effect that changes in rates have on assets is offset by the effect they have on insurance liabilities and on debt 
interest assumptions are used to compute the majority of torchmark s insurance liabilities 
these insurance liabilities  net of deferred acquisition costs  were billion and debt was 
billion at december   compared with fixed maturity investments of billion at amortized cost at the same date 
because of the long term nature of insurance liabilities  temporary changes in value caused by rate fluctuations have little bearing on ultimate obligations 
in accordance with gaap  insurance liabilities and debt are generally not marked to market 
market risk is managed in a manner consistent with torchmark s investment objectives 
torchmark seeks to maintain a portfolio of high quality  fixed maturity assets that are available for sale 
however  it is torchmark s primary objective to hold securities to maturity 
torchmark s strong operating cash flow and stable  long term policy liabilities decrease the likelihood of needing to sell fixed investments for operating liquidity 
some sales may be made to preserve capital due to changes in credit quality of individual securities or for certain business purposes 
while the lengthening of the fixed maturity portfolio can result in more period to period volatility in the fair value of the portfolio  torchmark s objective to generally hold securities to maturity to provide for its long term liabilities minimizes any real impact of interest rate changes on the company 
the company expects of the fixed portfolio to be repaid including calls within five years and within ten years 
no derivative instruments are used to manage torchmark s exposure to market risk in the investment portfolio 
interest rate swap instruments have been entered into by torchmark in connection with its trust preferred stock and certain of its debt issues as discussed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the caption capital resources in this report 
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of torchmark s interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december  and this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio 
the data are prepared through a model which incorporates various assumptions and estimates to measure the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points 
it takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options  put options  and unscheduled repayments could have on the portfolio  given the changes in rates 
the valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance 
market value of fixed maturity portfolio millions change in interest rates in basis points at december  at december  realized gains and losses 
as a group of life and health insurance carriers  torchmark collects premium income from its policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits  sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future 
in addition to the payment of these benefits  torchmark also incurs acquisition costs  administrative expenses  and taxes as a part of its insurance operations 
because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods  premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations 
for this reason  torchmark  as a part of its core insurance operations  holds a significant investment portfolio 
this portfolio consists primarily of high quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long term insurance product obligations 
as a result  fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities 
expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 
because torchmark holds this large and diverse investment portfolio  investments are occasionally sold or called  resulting in a realized gain or loss 
these gains and losses occur only incidentally  usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers 
investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments 
torchmark does not engage in trading investments for profit 
therefore  gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which are beyond the control of management are only secondary to torchmark s core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 
unlike investment income  they are not considered in determining premium rates or product profitability of torchmark s insurance products 
realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations  however  and as a result  have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause period to period trends of net income to not be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations 
accordingly  they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as management views its operations 
for these reasons  torchmark management removes the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating its overall insurance operating results 
the following table summarizes torchmark s tax effected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the three year period ended december  analysis of after tax realized gains losses amounts in millions  except for per share data year ended december  amount per share amount per share amount per share realized gains losses  net of tax  from investment sales and calls writedown of fixed maturities writedown of other investments valuation of interest rate swaps spread on interest rate swaps total the reduction in interest cost from swapping fixed rate obligations to floating rate 
in each year  torchmark wrote down several individual holdings to estimated fair value as a result of other than temporary impairment 
the impaired securities met some or all of torchmark s criteria for other than temporary impairment as discussed in note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in its critical accounting policies in this report 
pretax charges for these impairments were million in  million in  and million in of the issuers of bonds written down in through  the bonds of issuers were still held at december  at a fair value of million and a recorded book value of million 
accounting rules require torchmark to revalue its interest rate swaps at their fair value at the end of each accounting period 
the fair values of these instruments fluctuate with interest rates in financial markets and diminish with the passage of time so that their value is zero when they expire 
torchmark intends to hold its swaps until they expire and has historically done so 
therefore  while period to period fluctuations can be substantial  the value of the swaps and the cumulative unrealized gains and losses from marking the swaps to market value from inception will be zero when the swap agreements expire 
temporary unrealized changes in swap values are included as a component of realized investment gains losses on the consolidated statement of operations 
this fair value adjustment for all swaps on a pretax basis was a negative million in  a negative million in  and a positive million in in september   the securities and exchange commission informally interpreted sfas  the gaap rules concerning the reporting of nonhedged derivatives 
their interpretation concluded that all income and expenses related to a nonhedged derivative must be recorded in the same line item on the income statement that the adjustment to fair value is recorded 
this interpretation was effective immediately with prior periods reclassified accordingly for comparability 
to comply with this interpretation  torchmark combines the cash settlements in interest cost with the noncash unrealized fair value adjustment as a component of realized investment gains and losses 
therefore  torchmark includes the cash settlements on all swap derivatives in realized investment gains and losses 
torchmark s pretax interest cost reduction from these cash settlements included in realized investment gains was a positive million in  a positive million in  and a positive million in torchmark continues to reduce interest cost for this benefit in its segment analysis  because the segment analysis is required by gaap to be as management evaluates the performance of the segment 
torchmark views the benefit from lower interest rates as a reduction in its financing costs in its investment segment 
financial condition liquidity 
liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
torchmark s liquidity is derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations  a portfolio of marketable securities  and a line of credit facility 
torchmark s insurance operations have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of its immediate needs 
sources of cash flows from operations include primarily premium and investment income 
cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments  commissions  administrative expenses  and taxes 
operating cash inflows significantly exceed cash outflows primarily because life insurers  such as torchmark  expect to pay the majority of their policyholder benefits in future periods  sometimes many years later 
a liability is actuarially computed and recorded for these future benefits which increases as insurance in force grows so that torchmark can save for these future payments 
earnings are charged for the increase in this reserve each period  but there is no corresponding cash outlay 
therefore  cash provided from operations will generally significantly exceed net income in any given period 
cash flows are also generated by the maturities and scheduled repayments of torchmark s investment portfolio 
cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are invested to fund future requirements 
available cash flows are also used to repay debt  to buy back torchmark shares  to pay shareholder dividends  and for other corporate uses 
while torchmark s cash flows have historically been positive and very strong  a reduction in cash flow could negatively affect its liquidity 
cash flows provided from operations increased in each of the three years ended december  over their respective prior year 
they were million in  million in  and million in in addition  torchmark received million in investment maturities and repayments in  adding to available cash flows 
such repayments were million in and million in torchmark has in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand by letters of credit up to million 
for a detailed discussion of this line of credit facility  see the commercial paper section of note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
torchmark s cash and short term investments were million at year end and million at year end additionally  torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need 
these securities had a fair value of billion at december  however  torchmark s strong cash flows from operations  investment maturities  and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 
liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends 
the parent receives dividends from subsidiaries in order to meet dividend payments on common and preferred stock  interest and principal repayment requirements on parent company debt  and operating expenses of the parent company 
for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries  see the restrictions section of note shareholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has substantially exceeded the cash flow needs for parent company operations 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as fully described and discussed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt  torchmark has outstanding million par amount trust preferred securities 
the capital trusts which are liable for these securities are the legal entities which are responsible for the securities and facilitate the payment of dividends to shareholders 
they are off balance sheet arrangements which torchmark is required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules 
deconsolidation is necessary because they are considered to be variable interest entities in which torchmark has no variable interest and is therefore not the primary beneficiary of the entity  even though it owns all of the entity s voting equity 
while these liabilities are not on torchmark s balance sheet  they are represented by torchmark s junior subordinated debentures due to the trusts 
these junior subordinated debentures are a torchmark liability of million par and book value at december  and are indicated as a capital resource to torchmark under the caption capital resources in this report 
the preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by torchmark s interest payment on its debt to the trusts 
as described in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  torchmark has guaranteed the performance of the capital trusts to meet its financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders 
pension obligations to torchmark s employees are obligations of trust fund entities which are not reflected on torchmark s balance sheet 
the obligations of these trusts are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans 
these trust entities hold assets which are funded through periodic contributions by torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the pension obligations as they become due 
as of december   torchmark had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities 
all of torchmark s guarantees  other than the trust preferred guarantee  were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries  as disclosed in note commitments and contingencies 
all of torchmark s derivative instruments were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet 
the following table presents information about torchmark s contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december  in millions total thereafter fixed and determinable long term debt principal long term debt interest capital leases operating leases purchase obligations pension obligations fixed and determinable insurance obligations other long term obligations total fixed and determinable estimated contingent insurance obligations total interest on debt is based on torchmark s fixed contractual obligations 
as certain debt instruments have related swaps which exchange fixed obligations to those based on floating rates  torchmark s actual interest cost may be greater or lesser than presented 
at december   torchmark had in place swaps with a notional amount of million on its million of long term debt 
more information about torchmark s swaps is found in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension obligations are liabilities in trust funds that are not reflected on torchmark s consolidated balance sheet 
at december   these pension obligations were million  but there were also assets of million in the pension entities to fund those obligations 
the schedule of pension benefit payments is based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations except there is no interest assumption  because the payments are undiscounted 
please refer to note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on pension obligations 
these are remaining fixed payments due under insurance contracts where benefit payments began on or before december  unlike the liability on the consolidated balance sheet  which is discounted  the scheduled amounts are undiscounted and will sum to an amount greater than the discounted liability 
estimated contingent insurance obligations consist of estimated policy benefits to be paid in the future on policies in force at december  estimates are provided because the timing of the benefit payments is uncertain 
for a policy benefit to be paid  the policy must be current as to premium payments  and a triggering event must have occurred 
triggering events primarily include death or policy surrender for life insurance contracts and incurred medical claims for health insurance 
the estimated obligations reflect the company s current best estimate of future mortality  morbidity  and persistency experience 
amounts reported as estimated contingent insurance obligations are not computed using the same assumptions and methods that are used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits reported on the consolidated balance sheets for which assumptions are described in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
historically  premiums collected on torchmark insurance policies have been more than sufficient to cover benefit payments and fund reserves for future payments  as well as  cover all policy acquisition and administrative expenses 
in addition  the investment income earned on assets and operating cash flow is available in the unlikely event future premium revenue is insufficient to pay benefits 
a comparison of the estimated insurance revenue premiums and investment income to the estimated insurance obligations follows in millions total thereafter estimated insurance revenue less estimated insurance obligations excess of insurance revenues over obligations the insurance revenue  and the billion of invested assets supporting the liability for future policy benefits on the consolidated balance sheet  are more than sufficient to cover the insurance obligations and all other anticipated policy expenses 
capital resources 
torchmark s capital structure consists of short term debt the commercial paper facility described in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term funded debt  junior subordinated debentures supporting its trust preferred securities  and shareholders equity 
the junior subordinated debentures are payable to torchmark s capital trusts which are liable for its trust preferred securities 
in accordance with gaap  these instruments are included in due to affiliates on the consolidated balance sheet 
an analysis of long term debt issues outstanding is as follows at december  long term debt at december  dollar amounts in millions instrument year due interest rate par value book value fair value senior debentures notes notes senior notes issue expenses total long term debt junior subordinated debentures total unamortized issue expenses incurred upon issuance of the trust preferred securities 
included in due to affiliates in accordance with accounting regulations 
market value of the trust preferred securities which are obligations of the unconsolidated capital trusts 
the carrying value of torchmark s senior notes and its notes are adjusted each period to reflect the change in fair value of swap instruments which hedge the value of the notes 
the note swap instrument increased the value of long term debt by million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the note swap  which commenced in august   increased the value of long term debt million at december  the carrying value of the funded debt was million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information concerning funded debt 
in connection with these instruments  torchmark had in place four interest rate swap agreements at december   but also had another swap agreement which expired in september  these agreements exchange torchmark s fixed rate obligations on the debt instruments to floating rates 
information about these swaps is also found in the debt note 
torchmark maintains a significant available for sale fixed maturity portfolio to support its insurance policyholders liabilities 
torchmark is required by an accounting rule sfas to revalue this portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period 
the period to period changes in fair value  net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax  are reflected directly in shareholders equity 
changes in the fair value of the portfolio result from changes in interest rates in financial markets 
while sfas requires invested assets to be revalued  accounting rules do not permit interest bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner 
due to the size of torchmark s policy liabilities in relation to its shareholders equity  this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact in the reported value of shareholders equity 
if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets  the effect on equity would be largely offset 
fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period to period presentation of torchmark s shareholders equity  capital structure  and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets 
for this reason  torchmark s management  credit rating agencies  lenders  many industry analysts  and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of sfas when analyzing torchmark s balance sheet  capital structure  and financial ratios 
the following tables present selected data related to torchmark s capital resources 
additionally  the tables present the effect of sfas on relevant line items  so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark s capital structure

as previously mentioned  torchmark s board reaffirmed its continued authorization of the company s stock repurchase program in in amounts and timing that management  in consultation with the board  determined to be in the best interest of the company 
torchmark has repurchased its common stock every year since  except for  the year following the acquisition of american income 
since the beginning of  torchmark has repurchased million shares at a total cost of billion  and has acquired no fewer than million shares in any one year 
management believes that torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings  return on equity  and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value 
as noted earlier in this report  torchmark acquired million shares at a cost of million in  with excess cash flow 
if the million free cash flow used for the repurchase of torchmark common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds  an estimated million of additional investment income  after tax  would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have increased to 
because share purchases were made  actual net income per share was  an increase of 
torchmark intends to continue the repurchase of its common shares when financial markets are favorable 
credit ratings 
the credit quality of torchmark s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies 
during  standard and poor s upgraded torchmark s funded debt rating from a to a and its preferred securities rating from bbb to a

the aa rating is assigned by standard poor s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics  differing only slightly from those rated higher 
the a rating is assigned to an insurer with strong financial security characteristics  somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings 
the indicates that united investors is among the strongest insurers within the a category 
other items litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama 
such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined 
additionally  it should be noted that torchmark subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi  a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts 
bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case 
it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation 
based upon information presently available  and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries  contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by management to be material 
for more information concerning litigation  please refer to note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
transactions with related parties information regarding related party transactions is found in note related party transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
new unadopted accounting rules stock option expensing stock options have been granted to executives  employees  consultants  and directors as a form of compensation to provide motivation and to align the interests of these groups with the same interests of shareholders 
because they are generally granted at the fair value of torchmark stock at the date of grant  the value of these options increases as the value of torchmark stock increases 
the cost of these options is in the dilution caused by the exercise of the options  as the grantees ownership of the company grows in relation to existing shareholders 
this cost has historically been reflected in per share earnings in the financial statements through the increased dilution 
in december  the fasb revised statement  share based payment statement r  effective for torchmark as of july  the provisions of this statement will require torchmark to assign a hypothetical fair value to option grants and to recognize an expense in the financial statements for stock options based on this value  amortized over the period that the option vests 
this expense will be deducted from earnings and earnings per share in addition to it already being reflected in the dilution computation described above 
the fair value method contrasts with the intrinsic value method currently permitted by gaap and used by torchmark  whereby a value is assigned to an option only if the grant price is less than the fair value of the stock at the date of grant 
because torchmark s options are generally granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of torchmark stock  torchmark has historically incurred no option expense 
gaap rules currently require torchmark to disclose in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements the impact on earnings on a pro forma basis as if the fair value method were in effect 
the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to materially alter its methodology of calculating option expense or the results of expensing options to vary materially from the pro forma prior period disclosures 
while restatement of prior periods is permitted  the statement also permits a modified prospective method of adoption  whereby the expense of all unvested options as of july  and options granted after july  are expensed in accordance with the statement after that date 
torchmark will elect the modified prospective method of adoption 
the fair value assigned to option grants is derived from complex option pricing models using subjective assumptions such as price volatility and expected term 
considerable judgment is sometimes involved in the determination of these assumptions  which must be made at the time of option grant 
variations in actual experience versus the assumptions can cause material differences in an option s actual value when it is ultimately exercised versus its expense recorded in the financial statements 
additionally  popular pricing models do not take into account specific characteristics of employee option grants  such as vesting and transferability restrictions 
they also ignore the concept of mean reversion  assigning a higher value to an option when the underlying stock price is historically higher  when in reality an option is more valuable when granted at a historically lower price 
torchmark plans to use the black scholes pricing model as it has done for the pro forma disclosures  with assumptions most reflective of torchmark s experience 
earnings per share as described in note significant accounting policies  diluted earnings per share include the dilution resulting from the potential conversion of dilutive securities such as stock options into torchmark common stock 
the potential dilution from stock options has traditionally been calculated using the treasury stock method required by gaap 
this method assumes that torchmark uses the funds derived from the assumed exercise of options to buy treasury stock  thus reducing the net number of new shares outstanding resulting from the exercise 
the issuance by the fasb of statement r  requiring the expensing of stock options  revises the method of computing dilutive shares 
the revised method does not allow the treasury stock method which simulates cash flow  but instead limits cash receipts from the tax benefit and injects hypothetical concepts such as unrecognized option expense to the dilution model 
as a result  diluted shares outstanding under the new standard will bear no relationship to diluted shares outstanding under the historical model or to a pattern that the company could actually replicate with its cash flow 
critical accounting policies future policy benefits 
because of the long term nature of insurance contracts  torchmark s insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future 
the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry 
the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
while management and company actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits  there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents torchmark s ultimate obligation 
additionally  because of the size of this liability  significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts 
a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note future policy benefits reserves in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased 
the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset 
deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales 
additionally  the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption value of insurance purchased 
torchmark s policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
different assumptions with regard to deferred acquisition costs could produce materially different amounts of amortization 
for more information about accounting for deferred acquisition costs see note deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
policy claims and other benefits payable 
this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company 
the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to the company 
however  the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns 
factors involved include medical trend rates and medical cost inflation  the litigation environment  regulatory mandates  and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established 
changes in these estimates  if any  are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made 
torchmark management believes that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits  including the estimate of unsubmitted claims  are the most appropriate under the circumstances 
however  there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be torchmark s ultimate obligation 
revenue recognition 
premium income for torchmark s subsidiaries insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected 
however  in accordance with gaap  revenue on limited payment contracts and universal life type contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently 
revenues on limited payment contracts are recognized over the contract period 
premium for deposit balance products  such as torchmark s annuity and interest sensitive life policies  is added to the policy account value 
the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability 
this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance  administration  surrender  and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder 
in each case  benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 
investment income is reported as revenue by torchmark when it is earned  less investment expenses 
the investment activities of torchmark are integral to its insurance operations 
because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future  the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested 
anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates  contract liabilities  and other product contract features 
these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on torchmark s net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in its insurance and annuity products

impairment of investments 
torchmark continually monitors its investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value 
while the values of the investments in torchmark s portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions  an investment is considered to be impaired only when it has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary 
the policies and procedures that torchmark uses to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note significant accounting policies and note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report 
while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other than temporary impairment  it is difficult to predict the ultimate recoverable amount of a distressed or impaired security 
defined benefit pension plans 
torchmark maintains funded defined benefit plans covering most full time employees 
it also has unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees 
torchmark s obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions 
in accordance with gaap  an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time 
these obligations are offset by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans 
the actuarial assumptions used in determining torchmark s obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover  retirement age  the expected return on plan assets  projected salary increases  and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled 
these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation 
a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in torchmark s pension obligation 
a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation 
these assumptions are subjective in many cases and small changes in certain assumptions may cause material differences in reported results 
while management has used its best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions  given the information available from company experience  economic data  independent consultants and other sources  no assurance can be given that actual results will be the same as expected 
the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised  if necessary  based on more current information available to the company 
torchmark s discount rate  rate of return on assets  and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed in note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this note also contains information about pension plan assets  investment policies  funded status  and other related data
