item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the world leader in hand carried ultrasound hcu 
we specialize in the development of hand carried ultrasound systems for use across medical specialties and in a range of settings 
our proprietary technologies have enabled us to design hand carried diagnostic ultrasound systems that combine all digital  high resolution imaging with advanced features and capabilities typically found on cart based ultrasound systems 
we believe that the performance  mobility  durability  ease of use and cost effectiveness of our products are expanding existing diagnostic ultrasound markets and are opening new markets by bringing ultrasound out of the imaging center to other clinical settings and to the point of care such as the patient s bedside or the physician s examining table 
the size  weight  cost and complexity of cart based ultrasound systems typically require a physician or highly trained clinician to perform the examination in a centralized imaging department  such as a hospital s radiology department 
by providing cost effective high performance ultrasound at the point of care  our systems can eliminate delays associated with the referral process and enable medical professionals to use ultrasound more conveniently in a wider variety of clinical settings 
this increased accessibility is changing clinical practice  improving patient care and has the potential to reduce cost through earlier and more rapid diagnosis of diseases and conditions 
our products are used for imaging in medical specialties  such as radiology  cardiology  obstetrics and gynecology  emergency medicine  surgery  critical care  internal medicine and vascular medicine 
in addition  the us military has successfully deployed our systems in both traditional hospital settings and into field hospitals and forward surgical teams 
we began shipping our first products in september and today have an installed based of approximately  systems worldwide 
our first generation of products includes the and ilook series 
the sonosite plus system is designed for general ultrasound imaging and the sonoheart elite is specifically configured for cardiovascular applications 
the ilook imaging tool is designed to provide visual guidance for physicians and nurses while performing vascular access procedures and the ilook imaging tool is designed to provide imaging of the chest and abdomen 
our second generation product  the titan system  began shipping in june this high performance system has both general imaging and cardiology capabilities 
we have announced that we will introduce a product based on our third generation technology in the first half of we were formerly a division of atl ultrasound  inc  or atl 
on april   we were spun off as an independent  publicly owned washington corporation 
atl retained no ownership in us following the spin off 
we entered into a technology transfer and license agreement with atl pursuant to which we took ownership of certain ultrasound technology developed as part of a government grant and also patent rights  which had been established or were being pursued for that technology 
as part of this agreement  we also entered into a cross license whereby we had the exclusive right to use certain atl technology existing on april  or developed by atl during the three year period following april  in ultrasound systems weighing pounds or less  and atl had the exclusive right to use our technology existing on april  or developed by us during the same three year period in ultrasound systems weighing more than pounds 
on april   this cross license became nonexclusive and  except for the patented technology of each party  now extends to all ultrasound systems regardless of weight 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  warranty obligations  service contracts  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of these allowances by regularly reviewing the agings of our accounts receivable and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customers financial condition  historical payment experience  credit history and current economic condition 
losses can be difficult to anticipate 
an increase in losses beyond those expected by management would reduce earnings when they become probable or as the estimated loss increases 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on products and accessories when goods are shipped under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  sales returns are estimable and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for service contracts  revenue is recognized over the term of the contract 
revenue is recorded net of estimated returns 
sales discounts are recorded as a reduction in revenue 
in connection with sales to certain specific international customers  we sometimes conclude that full collection of the related accounts receivable is not reasonably assured due to extended payment terms or the financial condition of our customer and  consequently  we do not recognize revenue or cost of revenue at the time of title transfer 
in instances where collection is not reasonably assured  revenue and cost of revenue are recorded when cash is received 
our sales arrangements may contain multiple elements  which include hardware and software products 
revenue from the sale of software related elements in these arrangements is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we have vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for our products 
accordingly  for transactions that have undelivered elements for which we have vsoe of the elements  revenue equal to the total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and is not recognized until the element is delivered to the customer 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out method 
included in our inventories balance are demonstration products used by our sales representatives and marketing department and items that have been shipped to customers for which revenue recognition requirements have not been met 
adjustments to reduce carrying costs are recorded for obsolete material  earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product 
inventory items for which title has passed to customers are evaluated for recoverability based on the same process we use to evaluate collection of accounts receivable 
we make judgments regarding the carrying value of our inventories based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions  consumer demand and reimbursement criteria in the medical community 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to write down the cost of our inventories 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of sonometric health  inc sonometric 
we used the guidance provided by the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force issue no 
to determine that the acquisition of sonometric constituted the purchase of a business because it had the necessary inputs  processes and outputs 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate  for each reporting unit identified for purposes of accounting for goodwill 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
discrete financial information is available only for sonosite as a whole  there is no discrete financial information available for sonometric because it was incorporated into sonosite immediately after acquisition 
therefore  sonosite is the reporting unit to which goodwill resulting from the sonometric acquisition is assigned 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could potentially result in recognition of an impairment of goodwill  which would be reflected as a loss on our statement of operations and as a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets are comprised primarily of acquired technology and non compete agreements related to the sonometric acquisition 
we use our judgment to estimate the fair value of each of these intangible assets 
our judgment about fair value is based on our expectation of future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate 
we also use our judgment to estimate the useful lives of each intangible asset 
with respect to these intangible assets  we evaluate the remaining useful lives annually 
we also evaluate whether our intangible assets are impaired annually  or more frequently if circumstances dictate 
if we conclude that any of our intangible assets is impaired  we would record this as a loss on our statement of operations and as a reduction to the intangible asset 
warranty expense 
we accrue estimated warranty expenses at the time of sale for costs expected to be incurred under our product warranties 
this provision for warranty expenses is made based upon our historical experience and management s judgment 
we have limited history with some of our products 
any unexpected increase in defects would result in an increase in warranty expense and a reduction in earnings 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes 
this process involves calculating our current tax obligation or refund and assessing the nature and measurements of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  and our net operating loss and credit carryforwards  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in each period  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
to the extent we believe that we do not meet the test that recovery is more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we adjust our tax provision or tax benefit in the statement of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
since our inception  we have accumulated us federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards  foreign net operating loss carryforwards and research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets were recognized on our balance sheet in the fourth quarter of resulting in a one time income tax benefit 
prior to this time  we provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax assets primarily represent the income tax benefit of us net operating losses we have incurred 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we did not recognize any tax assets on our balance sheet until it was more likely than not that the tax assets related to our us operations would be realized 
we have retained a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset resulting from our international operations 
based upon a recent review of historical operating performance and our expectation that we will generate sustainable us profitability for the foreseeable future  we now believe it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
we will reevaluate our ability to utilize our nol and tax credit carryforwards in future periods and  in compliance with sfas no 
 record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we will reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol and tax credit carryforwards actually used in future quarters 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments and charges 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we have elected to measure our stock based compensation expense relating to grants to employees under our stock option plans using the intrinsic value method 
under this method  we record no compensation expense when we grant stock options to employees if the exercise price for a fixed stock option award granted to an employee is equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date we grant the stock option 
a different method for accounting for employee stock option grants is the fair value method 
under the fair value method  a company is required to determine the fair value of options granted to employees based on an option pricing model which incorporates such factors as the current stock price  exercise price of the options  expected volatility of future movements in the price of the underlying stock  risk free interest rates  the expected term of the options and any dividends expected to be paid 
the fair value determined under this method is then recognized over the vesting period of the related options 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under sfas r  the company will be required to follow a fair value approach using an option pricing model  such as the black scholes option valuation model  at the date of a stock option grant 
the deferred compensation amount calculated under the fair value method will then be recognized over the respective vesting period of the stock option 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas r during the third quarter of the adoption of sfas r is expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
also  sfas r will require us to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of the expense reflected in our financial statements as a financing cash flow  which may have a material impact on our future reported cash flows from operating activities 
results of operations revenue revenue increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in revenue in compared to was primarily due to increased international sales in europe  the us and japan  resulting primarily from increased sales of titan systems 
revenue increased to million in  compared to million in the increase in revenue in compared to was primarily due to an increase in sales in the us and europe 
united states us revenue increased to million in  compared to million in  due to higher sales force productivity 
government and military sales declined in compared to us revenue increased to million in  compared to million in  due to new product sales sales of titan systems  which were introduced during  increased government and military sales and higher sales force productivity 
rest of the world revenue from europe  africa and the middle east increased to million in from million in primarily due to an increase in revenue from direct sales in the united kingdom and germany and sales to our distributor in italy 
changes in exchange rates accounted for approximately million of the increase in revenue in revenue from europe  africa and the middle east increased to million in from million in primarily due to an increase in revenue from direct sales in the united kingdom  france and germany 
changes in exchange rates accounted for approximately million of the increase in revenue in revenue from canada  australia  south america  latin america and asia excluding japan increased to in from million in revenue from canada  australia  south america  latin america and asia excluding japan increased to million in from million in primarily due to a large sale to the government of argentina 
revenue from japan increased to million from million in primarily due to sales under our exclusive titan distribution arrangement with our distributor  aloka co 
ltd  initial sales under our exclusive ilook system distribution arrangement with our distributor  nippon sherwood medical industries ltd  and direct sales by our new subsidiary 
revenue from japan decreased to million in from million in primarily due to a decrease in orders from our former distributor  olympus 
the olympus organization underwent significant organizational changes  which affected its ability to provide sufficient sales and marketing focus on our products 
as a result  we established additional distribution relationships and our own subsidiary in japan 
we anticipate that revenue will increase in compared to prior years due to continued expansion of our direct selling efforts in the us and europe  the expansion of our new direct sales operations in japan  canada and australia  the expansion of our sales operations in china  introduction of new products and features  and the overall expansion of market awareness and acceptance of our products 
in  we anticipate continued improvement in our revenue from japan due to the establishment of a direct sales operation there and the establishment of additional distributor relationships 
our newly created wholly owned subsidiary in japan has received licenses in its name to sell the series  titan systems and ilook systems in japan 
however  regulatory approval of our new product introductions in japan could be delayed  which could impact our anticipated revenue 
additionally  the expansion of our sales operations in china may not be as successful as anticipated and we may encounter regulatory and other issues in selling our products there 
our revenue may also be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in the countries in which we sell our products in currencies other than the us dollar 
increased competition may also impact the extent of the increase in our anticipated growth in revenue 
we currently face competition from larger companies that manufacture cart based and portable ultrasound systems and have greater financial and other resources 
some of these competitors are introducing hand carried ultrasound products 
we anticipate shipping products incorporating our third generation ultrasound technology for selected clinical markets by mid year users of stationary ultrasound carts may not accept the new products  which could discourage widespread new users and uses for them 
our existing customers may not accept the new products due to pricing and functionality differences 
if demand for the new products does not meet our projections  we may experience excess inventory levels and may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to grow our business 
gross margin gross margin increased to in  compared to in and in the increase in gross margin in was primarily due to increased average selling prices resulting from increased sales of titan systems  improved manufacturing efficiencies due to the increased sales volume  a weaker us dollar and a reduction in the royalty owed to our former parent  atl  which became effective in september the increase in gross margin in was primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and increased average selling prices 
the increased average selling prices resulted primarily from initial sales of titan systems  an increase in the percentage of direct sales compared with distributor sales and an increase in sales of products with advanced feature configurations 
we expect our gross margin percentage in to increase slightly from  due to increased average selling prices  increased manufacturing efficiencies and also due to a reduction in the royalty owed to atl 
nevertheless  increased competition from existing and new competitors in the highly portable ultrasound system market could result in lower average realized prices and could lower our gross margin 
our gross margin can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based on the mix of business between direct and distributor sales and our product and accessories sales mixes 
changes in our cost of inventory also may impact our gross margin 
adjustments to reduce carrying costs are recorded for obsolete material  earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product 
if market conditions change or the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to write down the carrying value of our inventory  resulting in a negative impact on gross margins 
additionally  we rely on our sales forecasts by product to determine production volume 
to the extent our sales forecasts or product mix estimates are inaccurate  we may produce excess inventory or experience inventory shortages  which may result in an increase in our costs of revenue  a decrease in our gross margin or lost sales 
our gross margin may also be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in the countries in which we sell our products in currencies other than the us dollar 
operating expenses research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in research and development expenses increased in compared to primarily due to expenses associated with the development of advanced features and accessories for the titan system and the development of our next generation product  which is expected to be released in mid research and development expenses decreased in compared to primarily due to expenses incurred in associated with the development of the titan system and the ilook products combined with a reduction in product development costs in due to the completion of the titan system  which first shipped to customers in june we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in due to increased development related to products utilizing our third generation technology 
however  should our competitors develop products with features that equal or exceed the features that exist in our products  we may incur higher than anticipated research and development costs in order to accelerate existing programs and compete more effectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase in expenses in compared to was primarily due to expansion of our international operations  increased compensation for commissions related to the increase in revenue and costs related to improving our sales processes 
changes in exchange rates accounted for approximately million of the increase in expenses in the million increase in sales and marketing expenses in compared to was primarily due to increased expenses in europe 
expenses in europe increased due to the increase  year over year  in the number of sales representatives there and expenses associated with the titan product launch 
in addition  expenses increased due to the increase  year over year  in the number of clinical application specialists in the us  and expenses associated with the reconfiguration of our us sales territories in early changes in exchange rates accounted for approximately million of the increase in expenses in we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in will increase primarily due to marketing expenses associated with the introduction of our next generation product  increased compensation for commissions related to the anticipated increase in revenue  expansion of direct sales operations in japan  canada and australia and continued growth in our european subsidiaries 
additionally  we may incur significant expenses in the expansion of our sales operations in china 
general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in general and administrative expenses was related primarily to supporting our business growth  to meeting requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act and in defending our patent rights in the existing neutrino patent infringement litigation 
the increase in was primarily due to supporting our business growth and to legal and consulting expenses associated with medical reimbursement activities 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in in order to support our increased business activity 
also  we will incur substantial additional legal expenses in connection with pending litigation and arbitration matters 
in addition  we may incur unanticipated legal expenses if we become involved in any new litigation 
other income loss for other income and loss  we reported income of million in compared to million in the decrease in compared to was primarily due to net foreign currency losses of approximately  in compared to gains of  in we reported income of million in compared to million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to net foreign currency gains of approximately  and net realized gains on investments of approximately  in income tax benefit during the fourth quarter of  we recognized deferred tax assets resulting in a net income tax benefit of million 
the deferred tax assets primarily represent the income tax benefit of us net operating losses and tax credits we have incurred 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we did not recognize any tax assets on our balance sheet until it was more likely than not that the tax assets would be realized 
we have retained a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets resulting from our international operations 
based upon a recent review of historical operating performance and our expectation that we will generate sustainable us profitability for the foreseeable future  we now believe it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets will be fully realized and  accordingly  recognized an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of we will reevaluate our ability to realize our nol and tax credit carryforwards in future periods and  in compliance with sfas no 
 record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we will reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol carryforwards actually used in future quarters 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments and charges 
due to the recognition of deferred tax assets in  we expect to record income tax expense for financial reporting purposes  beginning in  related to the profitability of our us operations 
the income tax expense will be based on a blended federal and state rate applied to us income 
while this tax expense will reduce net income  no cash will be paid for income taxes  other than required alternative minimum tax and state tax payments  until the nol and tax credits have been fully utilized 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  cash and cash equivalents were primarily invested in money market accounts 
our short term and long term investment securities totaled million  compared to million as of december  investment securities consist of high grade us government or corporate debt and high grade asset backed securities 
while our intent is to hold our securities until maturity  we classify all securities as available for sale  as the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity to implement management strategies 
operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to cash used of million in and million in the increase in cash provided in was primarily due to the generation of a net profit in compared to a net loss in  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to increased business activity 
this was partially offset by our non cash deferred tax benefit  increases in accounts receivable and inventories to support our business growth  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due to  among other things  an increased cash deposit for a value added tax guarantee by our u 
k subsidiary 
the decrease in cash used in compared with was primarily due to a million reduction in our net loss 
this was offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories to support our business growth 
we anticipate that cash provided by operations will increase in compared to primarily due to anticipated continued profitable operations 
this increase will depend on our ability to successfully sell our products  collect our receivables  control our inventories and manage our expenses 
our cash flow from operations may also be impacted by income tax benefits on stock options  which are required to be classified as cash provided by financing activities once we adopt sfas r  share based payment  in the third quarter of investing activities used cash of million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease in cash used in both and compared to the prior year was due to a reduction in net purchases of investment securities million in compared to million in and million in in  this was offset by our acquisition of sonometric and increased purchases of property and equipment 
we anticipate using cash to invest in high quality investment instruments in  the extent of which will depend on the interest rate environment during the period and the timing of cash flows from our operations during the period 
financing activities provided cash of million in  compared to million in  and million in the main source of cash provided by financing activities in was the exercise of stock options totaling million  compared to million in and million in in may  we received net proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share 
we believe that our existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures in nevertheless  we may experience an increased need for additional cash due to any significant decline in our revenue or gross margin  any delay or inability to collect accounts receivable  any acquisition or strategic investment in another business  any significant increase in expenditures as a result of expansion of our sales and marketing infrastructure  our manufacturing capability or our product development activities  any significant increase in our sales and marketing expenditures as a result of our introduction of new products  and any significant increase in expenditures related to the neutrino patent infringement litigation 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet debt 
furthermore  except for certain foreign exchange rate hedging transactions that we enter into from time to time  discussed more fully under foreign currency risk in item a below  we are not a party to any derivative transaction 
we apply the disclosure provisions of fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  to our agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses 
we provide i indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers and distributors against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products  ii indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers against third party claims arising as a result of defects in our products  iii indemnifications of varying scope and size to consultants against third party claims arising from the services they provide to us  and iv guarantees to support obligations of some of our subsidiaries such as lease payments 
these indemnifications and guarantees give rise only to the disclosure provisions of fin to date  we have not incurred material costs as a result of these obligations and do not expect to incur material costs in the future 
accordingly  we have not accrued any liabilities in our consolidated financial statements related to these indemnifications or guarantees 
contractual obligations we have the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other commitments as part of our agreements with our suppliers  suppliers may procure resources and material expected to be used for the manufacture of our product in accordance with our production schedule provided to them 
we may be responsible for compensating our suppliers for these procurements in the event these items are not used in the quantities submitted as part of the production schedule or material becomes obsolete as a result of production timing  material changes or design changes 
as part of obtaining our lease for our current facility  we were required to deposit approximately  representing restricted cash with our bank 
also  we were required to maintain a deposit of approximately  with our bank in the united kingdom as security for payment of customs and duties charges 
both amounts are included in other long term assets and are not included in the table above 
in march  one of our component suppliers  philips semiconductor  or philips  informed us that  commencing in september  it would discontinue production of certain integrated circuit chips used in some of our products 
in the second quarter of  we entered into a purchase commitment totaling approximately million for supplies of these chips from philips for our anticipated manufacturing needs 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into an additional purchase commitment with philips totaling approximately million for supplies of these same chips 
as of december   our remaining total purchase commitment was approximately million and we are required to take possession of  and pay for  the balance of the undelivered chips during the first six months of demand for our products  however  may exceed our forecasts  in which case we would require additional quantities of these chips to manufacture additional products 
conversely  if demand for our products falls short of our forecasts  we may experience excess inventory of these chips 
if our actual demand for these chips varies significantly from our forecasted demand  we may experience delays in manufacturing  lost sales  a write down of inventory or a deterioration in gross margin 
in the us  we have complemented our direct sales efforts by entering into group purchasing agreements with major healthcare group purchasing organizations  or gpos 
typically  a gpo negotiates with medical suppliers  such as us  on behalf of the gpo s member healthcare facilities  providing such members with uniform pricing and terms and conditions 
in exchange  the gpo identifies us as a preferred supplier for its members 
member facilities participating in the gpo s purchasing program can consist of hospitals  medical group practices  nursing homes  surgery centers  managed care organizations  long term care facilities  clinics and integrated delivery networks 
currently  we have gpo supply agreements with various groups including amerinet  inc  premier  inc  broadlane  inc 
includes kaiser permanente  tenet healthcare and others and consorta  inc these agreements require us to pay fees based on the amount of sales generated from these agreements 
we recorded fees related to these agreements as sales and marketing expenses in the amounts of approximately  in   in and  in recent accounting pronouncements we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin r  as of april  fin r addresses consolidation of certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
the guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments 
the accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after june   while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after june  in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf  effective date of paragraphs of eitf issue no 
the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp eitf 
fsp eitf delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs of eitf issue during the period of the delay  fsp eitf states that companies should continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance 
the adoption of eitf  excluding paragraphs  did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company will assess the impact of paragraphs of eitf once the guidance has been finalized 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
sfas clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
further  sfas requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions in this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of fas s will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 

the provisions of this statement are effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  this statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is  transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 or eitf  applying the conditions in paragraph of fasb statement no 
in determining whether to report discontinued operations 
the guidance should be applied to a component of an enterprise that is either disposed of or classified as held for sale in fiscal periods that began after december  we do not believe that the adoption of eitf will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
sfas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 
the american jobs creation act of introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer  provided certain criteria are met 
sfas provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision  and was effective immediately upon issuance 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r revises sfas and supersedes apb sfas r applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments 
under sfas r  the company will be required to follow a fair value approach using an option pricing model  such as the black scholes option valuation model  at the date of a stock option grant 
the deferred compensation amount calculated under the fair value method will then be recognized over the respective vesting period of the stock option 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas r during the third quarter of the adoption of sfas r is expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
also  sfas r will require us to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in our financial statements as a financing cash flow  which may have a material impact on our future reported cash flows from operating activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk relating to changes in interest rates  which could adversely affect the value of our investments in marketable securities 
as of december   our portfolio consisted of million of interest bearing debt securities with maturities of less than one year and million of interest bearing debt securities with maturities of more than one year 
our intent is to hold these securities until maturity  but we have classified them as available for sale in the event of unanticipated cash needs 
the interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and related earnings for from a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk except for sales transacted by our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  we transact all our sales in us dollars  or usds  therefore  the obligations of many of our international customers are in usds 
our exposure to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies relates primarily to the strengthening of the usd against the local currency of our international subsidiaries  which may result in foreign exchange losses on transactions with them  and our international customers  which may impact our ability to collect amounts owed by them
