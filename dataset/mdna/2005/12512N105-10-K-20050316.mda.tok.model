item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview we are a leading direct marketer of multi brand computers and related technology products and services in the united states 
our primary business is conducted from a combined corporate office and distribution center located in vernon hills  illinois  and sales offices in illinois  virginia  connecticut  new jersey  and toronto  canada 
additionally  we market and sell products through cdw 
com  cdwg 
com  macwarehouse 
com and cdw 
ca  our web sites 
for financial reporting purposes  we have two operating segments corporate  which is primarily comprised of business customers  but also includes consumers which generated approximately of net sales in and  and public sector  which is comprised of federal  state and local government entities and educational institutions who are served by cdw government  inc cdw g  a wholly owned subsidiary 
cdw management monitors a number of financial and non financial measures and ratios on a daily  weekly  and monthly basis in order to track the progress of the business and make adjustments as necessary 
we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include daily sales  by business segment and total company  gross margin  number of orders shipped per day  number of orders shipped complete per day  inventory balance and turnover  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance  accounts receivable balance and aging  and operating expenses 
the measures and ratios are compared to standards or targets set by management  so that actions can be taken  as necessary  in order to achieve the standards and targets 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and revisions to estimates are included in our results for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the estimates and assumptions used in accounting for revenue recognition  inventory valuation and vendor transactions have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  and therefore  are considered to be our critical accounting policies 
the following discussion details the estimates and assumptions associated with these policies 
revenue recognition 
we record revenues from sales transactions when both risk of loss and title to products sold pass to the customer 
our shipping terms dictate that the passage of title occurs upon receipt of products by the customer 
the majority of our revenues relate to physical products and are recognized on a gross basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as net sales and the acquisition cost of the product recorded as cost of sales 
software assurance products  third party services and extended warranties that we sell for which we are not the primary obligor are recognized on a net basis in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
accordingly  such revenues are recognized in net sales either at the time of sale or over the contract period  based on the nature of the contract  at the net amount retained by us  with no cost of sales 
in accordance with this revenue recognition policy  we estimate the value of products that have shipped but that have not been received by the customer and record an adjustment to reverse the impact of these sales out of our results for the current period and into our results for the subsequent period 
in doing so  we perform an analysis to determine the estimated number of days that product is in transit  using data from commercial 
table of contents delivery services 
changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days used in making this adjustment and could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the current period 
inventory valuation 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we decrease the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
many of our vendors price protect our inventory purchases for a specified period of time 
if vendors were to change these programs  additional inventory write downs may be required 
vendor transactions 
we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates  bid programs  price protection and other programs 
these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or net advertising expense  as appropriate 
vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs which could have an impact on our results of operations 
the inability to collect receivables related to these vendor transactions could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income 
in september  we purchased selected us assets and the canadian operations of micro warehouse  a reseller of computers  software and peripheral products 
the us transaction  completed on september   was accounted for as a purchase of assets  with the million purchase price allocated to the assets purchased  including inventory  fixed assets  and customer lists  based upon their fair values at the date of purchase 
subsequent to the completion of the us transaction  sales made by former members of the micro warehouse us sales force who joined cdw in conjunction with this transaction  along with the associated costs  are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the canadian transaction  completed on september   was accounted for as the purchase of a business and  accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired business subsequent to the date of purchase are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and the assumed assets and liabilities were recorded based upon their fair values at the date of purchase 
the canadian operations were purchased for million 
recently issued or newly adopted accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires the company to measure all share based payments to coworkers under our stock based compensation plans using a fair value based method and record compensation expense related to these payments in our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after june   therefore  we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of the pro forma disclosures previously required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
note to our consolidated financial statements presents pro forma net income and earnings per share amounts as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to stock based employee compensation  which would have reduced reported diluted earnings per share by  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r and have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in compensation expense of an amount similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas we intend to use the modified prospective application transition method  which allows for prospective recognition of compensation expense without restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information on other recently issued or newly adopted accounting pronouncements

starting in  annualized inventory turnover is computed on an average daily basis 
annualized inventory turnover for has been restated using the new method 
due to the inability to recapture daily inventory information  we were not able to calculate the statistic using the new method 
the increase in accounts receivable days sales outstanding is primarily due to a higher percentage of sales on terms and a larger proportion of accounts receivable from federal government customers  which typically have a longer pay cycle than corporate customers

we experienced double digit unit volume growth in most product categories on a year over year basis 
sales of notebook computers and accessories  desktop computers and servers  software  video and add on boards memory each increased over in over corporate segment sales increased  to billion in from billion in  and comprised of our total sales for public sector segment sales increased  to billion in from billion in  and comprised of our total sales for 
table of contents in general  the average selling price of most of our product categories decreased in from this decrease in average selling price is a trend experienced across our industry 
such decreases require us to generate more orders and sell more units in order to maintain or increase the level of sales 
gross profit increased to million in  compared to million in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was in  compared to in the increase in the gross profit percentage was primarily due to an increase in vendor volume rebates  an increase in cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales  and an increase in net service contract revenue 
vendor volume rebates increased due to achieving goals set by our vendor partners 
cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales increased due to a higher level of cooperative advertising funds received from our vendors and the classification of a higher percentage of these funds as a reduction of cost of sales rather than as a reduction of advertising expense in the increase in net service contract revenue is due to higher sales of products accounted for on a net basis  such as warranties and software assurance products 
our objective for gross profit as a percentage of net sales is between and 
the gross profit margin depends on various factors  including vendor rebate and inventory price protection programs  cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales  product mix  including third party services  pricing strategies  market conditions  and other factors  any of which could result in changes in gross margins from recent experience 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  while decreasing as a percentage of net sales to versus in included in selling and administrative expenses in and were million and million of transaction and integration expenses related to the micro warehouse transactions 
the primary drivers of the increase in selling and administrative expenses are discussed below 
payroll costs increased million  primarily due to our continued investment in our sales force and increases in administrative areas to support a larger and growing business 
our sales force increased from  at december   to  at december  our sales force consists of account managers including field sales representatives as well as product category specialists who provide consultation in areas requiring technical or specialized product expertise such as networking  security  data storage  and volume software licensing 
payroll costs for and also included million and million  respectively  of expenses for former micro warehouse employees performing transition services 
employee related costs which include items such as profit sharing  incentive awards  and insurance increased million  primarily due to increased insurance costs resulting from higher insurance rates  higher medical and prescription expenses and coverage for a larger number of coworkers 
in  employee related costs included million of employee benefits related to the micro warehouse transactions

occupancy costs for and included and million  respectively  of facility expenses related to the micro warehouse transactions 
other selling and administrative costs increased million 
other selling and administrative costs for and included million and million  respectively  of costs related to the micro warehouse transactions 
excluding these costs  the increase in other selling and administrative costs is primarily due to increased administrative expenses required to support a larger business  such as professional fees  telephone expenses  and travel and entertainment expenses 
the million of costs related to the micro warehouse transactions in included million for an increase in the reserve for equipment purchased from micro warehouse in its wilmington  ohio distribution center 
table of contents and million of legal fees  partially offset by million of income from collections of accounts receivable generated by micro warehouse prior to the micro warehouse transactions

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales in increased to billion  compared to billion in of the growth in sales  approximately half is attributed to the addition of customers as a result of the micro warehouse transactions 
the other half is due to a more favorable it spending environment  particularly toward the end of  and our investment in our sales force  with the addition of new account managers in excluding former members of the micro warehouse sales force who joined cdw in conjunction with the micro warehouse transactions

gross profit increased to million in  compared to million in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was in  compared to in the increase in the gross profit percentage was primarily due to the adoption in january of eitf the income statement classification provisions of eitf cover vendor consideration related to agreements entered into or modified after january  this pronouncement requires that consideration from vendors  such as advertising support funds  be accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales unless certain requirements are met showing that the funds are used for a specific program entirely funded by an individual vendor 
if these specific requirements related to individual vendors are met  the consideration is accounted for as a reduction in the related expense category  such as advertising or selling and administrative expense 
we provide numerous advertising programs to support vendors  including catalogs  television  radio  internet  
table of contents magazine  and newspaper advertising for which we receive consideration 
some of these programs relate to multiple vendors  while others are performed on behalf of individual vendors for specific projects 
as a consequence of adopting eitf  we recorded million of vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales in  which would have previously been recorded as a reduction of advertising expense million and selling and administrative expense million 
excluding the impact of eitf  and therefore on a non gaap basis  the gross profit margin would have been in compared to in the non gaap gross profit margin is included in this discussion because the company believes it provides a meaningful comparison to reported results of prior periods 
the gross profit margin depends on various factors  including vendor rebate and inventory price protection programs  cooperative advertising funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales  product mix  including third party services  pricing strategies  market conditions  and other factors 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million in  compared to million in included in selling and administrative expenses in were million of transaction and integration expenses related to the micro warehouse transactions 
the primary drivers of the increase in selling and administrative expenses are discussed below

the remaining million relates to a reserve established for the equipment in a wilmington  ohio distribution center leased by micro warehouse 
in september  in conjunction with our purchase of selected us assets of micro warehouse  we agreed to assume the lease for the distribution center and purchase the equipment in the facility for million if requested by micro warehouse 
in february  under the terms of a modified agreement  we purchased the equipment and forfeited leasing the distribution center in exchange for million 
the purchase price of the equipment in the facility of million  net of the reserve of million  reflected the estimated realizable value of the equipment to cdw 
selling and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in versus in transaction and integration expenses recorded in connection with the micro warehouse transactions  totaling million  accounted for of the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to the increase in payroll costs described above resulting from additions to our sales force 

table of contents net advertising expense increased to million in  compared to million in this increase is primarily due to the adoption of eitf  which resulted in the reclassification of million of vendor consideration to a reduction of cost of sales  which would previously have been recorded as a reduction of advertising expense 
additionally  million of the increase is due to customer communication and advertising costs related to the micro warehouse transactions 
gross advertising expense increased slightly  to million in  compared to million in  while decreasing as a percentage of net sales to versus in excluding the impact of eitf  and therefore on a non gaap basis  cooperative advertising reimbursements increased to million in  compared to million in this non gaap measurement is included because the company believes it provides a more meaningful comparison to reported results of prior periods

seasonality sales in our corporate segment  which serves primarily business and  to a small extent  consumer customers  have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year 
in contrast  sales in our public sector segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters due to the buying patterns of federal government and education customers 
if sales to public sector customers continue to increase as a percentage of overall sales  the company as a whole may experience increased seasonality in future periods 
legal proceedings for a description of certain legal proceedings  see item of part i of this form k 
liquidity and capital resources working capital we have historically financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and current marketable securities of million  representing an increase of million in cash  cash equivalents  and current marketable securities from december  our working capital increased million  to  million at december  from million at december  the increase in working capital was a result of increases in cash  cash equivalents  and current marketable securities  accounts receivable and merchandise inventory  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the increases in these categories are primarily due to our sales growth 

table of contents we have an aggregate million available pursuant to two million unsecured lines of credit with two financial institutions 
one line of credit expires in june  at which time we intend to renew the line  and the other does not have a fixed expiration date 
borrowings under the first credit facility bear interest at the prime rate less  libor plus or the federal funds rate plus  as determined by the company 
borrowings under the second credit facility bear interest at the prime rate less  libor plus or the federal funds rate plus  as determined by the company 
at december   there were no borrowings under either of the credit facilities 
we have entered into security agreements with certain financial institutions in order to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions 
the agreements allow for a maximum credit line of million collateralized by inventory purchases financed by the financial institutions 
at december  and  we owed the financial institutions approximately million and million  respectively  which is included in trade accounts payable 
pursuant to share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors  we purchased  shares of our common stock in at a total cost of million an average price of per share and  shares of our common stock in at a total cost of million an average price of per share 
we have authority under a repurchase program authorized in july to repurchase up to  additional shares 
these purchases may be made from time to time in both open market and private transactions  as conditions warrant 
this repurchase program is expected to remain in effect through july  unless earlier terminated by the board or completed 
repurchased shares are held in treasury pending use for general corporate purposes  including issuances under various employee stock plans 
on may   our board of directors declared an annual cash dividend to shareholders 
this dividend of per share  totaling million  was paid on june   to shareholders of record on june  we paid a dividend of per share  totaling million  on september  in future years  we plan to announce any dividend following the annual shareholders meeting  typically held in may 
the timing and amount of any future dividends will depend upon the earnings  cash requirements and financial condition of the company and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
we currently have one distribution center  located with our corporate headquarters  in vernon hills  illinois 
the capacity of this distribution center should be sufficient to handle our expected growth in sales and shipments at least through  based on current projections 
we will continue to make investments in this distribution center to further automate the facility and increase its efficiency 
in february  we signed a lease for a new distribution center to be constructed in north las vegas  nevada  to support the company s projected growth beyond we expect the new facility to be completed and operational by the end of capital expenditures for machinery  equipment and leasehold improvements related to this second distribution center are anticipated to be approximately to million in and will cause capital expenditures in to be significantly higher than recent years 
however  we believe that our internally generated cash flow will be sufficient to cover these capital expenditures 
in addition  we expect to incur approximately to million of operating and start up costs related to this facility  primarily in the third and fourth quarters of our current and anticipated uses of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are to fund growth in working capital and capital expenditures necessary to support future growth in sales  our stock buyback program  potential dividends and possible expansion through acquisitions 
we believe that the funds held in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and funds available under the credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our working capital and cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in the primary factors that affected our cash flow from operations were net income  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
accounts receivable increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in sales and a larger portion of business being done on terms rather than on credit cards 
accounts payable increased to 
table of contents million at december   compared to million at december  the accounts payable balance fluctuates due to our normal cycle of payments 
the increase in accounts payable at december  was primarily due to this periodic fluctuation 
the change in accounts payable reflected in cash provided from operating activities also includes the impact of a million decrease in book overdrafts between december  and december  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this includes million used to purchase marketable securities and million used for capital expenditures

capital expenditures related primarily to computer software and leasehold improvements 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this includes the payment of cash dividends totaling million  the repurchase of  shares of our common stock at a total cost of million  and the impact of a million decrease in book overdrafts between december  and december  these items were partially offset by proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options under our various stock option plans and million from the issuance of common stock in connection with the employee stock purchase plan 
in may  gregory c 
zeman  former director and vice chairman of the company  and daniel b 
kass  former director and executive vice president of the company  sold a total of  shares of common stock 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares and the number of outstanding common shares was not impacted 
the shares sold by mr 
zeman and mr 
kass were acquired from michael p 
krasny  the chairman emeritus  principal shareholder  and a director of the company  through the exercise of options previously granted to them pursuant to the mpk stock option plan 
the exercise of options by mr 
zeman and mr 
kass resulted in the realization by the company of an income tax benefit of approximately million in  of which approximately million had been previously recorded to deferred taxes 
we recorded the incremental tax benefit of million as an increase to paid in capital 
in addition  we recorded incremental payroll tax expense related to the option exercise of approximately million  which reduced diluted earnings per share in by less than per share 
aggregate contractual obligations at december   we were obligated under various operating lease agreements  primarily for sales office facilities  that expire at various dates through these lease agreements generally provide for minimum rent payments and a proportionate share of operating expenses and property taxes and include certain renewal and expansion options 
for the years ended december   and  rent expense was million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to fulfill these commitments from our working capital
