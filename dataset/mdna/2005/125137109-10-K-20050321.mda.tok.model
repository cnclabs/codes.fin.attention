critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that require significant judgment 
self insurance the company estimates its liability for incurred but unsettled general liability and workers compensation related claims under its self insured retention programs  including reported losses in the process of settlement and losses incurred but not reported 
the estimate is based on loss development factors determined through actuarial methods using the actual claim loss experience of the company subject to adjustment for current trends 
revisions to the estimated liability resulting from ongoing periodic reviews are recognized in the period in which the differences are identified 
significant increases in general liability and workers compensation claims could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives and recoverability of its depreciable assets based on factors including historical experience  the expected beneficial service period of the asset  the quality and durability of the asset and the company s maintenance policy including periodic upgrades 
changes in useful lives are made on a prospective basis  unless factors indicate the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows and an impairment write down is necessary 
lease accounting the company uses a consistent lease period generally  the initial non cancelable lease term plus renewal option periods provided for in the lease that can be reasonably assured when calculating depreciation of leasehold improvements and in determining straight line rent expense and classification of its leases as either an operating lease or a capital lease 
the lease term and straight line rent expense commences on the date when the company takes possession and has the right to control use of the leased premises 
funds received from the lessor intended to reimburse the company for the costs of leasehold improvements is recorded as a deferred credit resulting from a lease incentive and amortized over the lease term as a reduction to rent expense

revised  share based payment 
sfas r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees

sfas r is effective at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  under apb opinion no 
 no stock based compensation cost has been reflected in the net income of the company for grants of stock options to employees 
beginning in the third quarter of  the company will recognize compensation expense in its financial statements based on the fair value of all share based payments to employees
