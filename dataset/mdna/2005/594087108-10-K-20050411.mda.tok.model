item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality 
artistree we currently operate a vertically integrated manufacturing operation named artistree that supplies our michaels and aaron brothers stores with quality custom and specialty framing merchandise 
in addition  artistree also provides ready made frames and art prints that are sold in our michaels stores 
our regional processing centers are located in city of industry  california  coppell  texas  and kernersville  north carolina 
kernersville  north carolina is also the home of our moulding manufacturing and ready made frame plant 
our art prints are packaged and distributed out of our coppell  texas regional processing center 
combined  these facilities occupy approximately  square feet and  in fiscal  processed over million linear feet of frame moulding for our michaels and aaron brothers stores 
our moulding manufacturing plant converts the raw lumber into finished frame moulding that is supplied to our regional processing centers for custom framing orders or for the completion of ready made frames for our stores 
we manufacture approximately of the moulding we process  import another from quality manufacturers in indonesia  malaysia  brazil  and italy  and purchase the balance from distributors 
the custom framing orders are processed frames cut and joined  and mats cut and shipped to our stores where the custom frame order is completed for customer pick up 
we believe artistree provides a competitive advantage to our michaels and aaron brothers stores 
based on the benefits we have received from this vertically integrated solution  we continue to evaluate additional future vertical integration opportunities 
distribution we currently operate a distribution system that supplies our stores with merchandise  including substantially all seasonal and promotional items 
approximately of michaels stores merchandise is shipped through the michaels distribution system  with the remainder shipped directly from vendors 
approximately of aaron brothers stores merchandise is shipped through the aaron brothers distribution center  with the remainder being shipped directly from our vendors 
our six current distribution centers are located in california  florida  illinois  pennsylvania  and texas 
in fiscal  we completed an expansion of our california distribution center and added a new distribution facility in hazleton  pennsylvania  which added approximately million square feet of capacity 
in fiscal  we constructed a new distribution center located in the chicago  illinois area  from which we began shipping orders in june as we ceased operations in our kentucky distribution center 
at the end of fiscal  the lease on our kentucky distribution center ended 
the  square feet of our new illinois distribution center  offset by the closing of our kentucky distribution center  added approximately  square feet to our capacity  bringing the total capacity to approximately million square feet 
in addition to these distribution facilities  we utilize three third party warehouse facilities to store and supply our seasonal merchandise in preparation for the holiday season 
michaels stores generally receive deliveries from the distribution centers each week through an internal distribution network using a dedicated fleet of trucks and contract carriers 
aaron brothers stores receive merchandise on a weekly or biweekly basis from their dedicated  square foot distribution center located in the los angeles  california area 
star wholesale stores receive some merchandise from the distribution centers  but most star wholesale merchandise is received through direct vendor shipments 
in february  we completed the implementation of a new transportation management system to manage our transportation processes between our vendors  distribution centers  and stores 
the new internet based system has allowed us to increase the visibility of merchandise shipments within our supply chain and improve our overall transportation efficiency 
we believe that our distribution system  with its planned expansion and new transportation management system  will allow us to maintain sufficient inventory in each store to meet our customers demands while improving control over our overall investment in inventory 
we currently have approximately of our basic skus replenished through our distribution system 
we intend to have approximately of our basic skus replenished through our distribution system  which may reduce our overall supply chain costs  including store level receiving  improve our service level to the stores  and allow us to more effectively manage our inventory investment 
during fiscal  we will test a number of enhancements to our distribution systems with select suppliers  enabling us to evaluate our ability to distribute additional skus through our distribution centers 
store expansion and relocation having become the largest national retailer of arts  crafts  and decorative items  we recognized in that we had the critical mass to achieve improved operating efficiencies that could result in higher returns on capital by focusing on key initiatives  such as strengthening our information systems and infrastructure to support future growth in the number of stores 
in fiscal  we announced a shift in focus from store growth to higher returns on capital and as a result  moderated our internal growth rate in number of stores 
beginning in fiscal  we expanded our new store opening program and have continued to grow our number of stores through fiscal the following table shows our store growth for the last five years fiscal year michaels stores retail stores open at beginning of year retail stores opened during the year retail stores opened relocations during the year retail stores closed during the year retail stores closed relocations during the year retail stores open at end of year aaron brothers stores retail stores open at beginning of year retail stores opened during the year retail stores opened relocations during the year retail stores closed during the year retail stores closed relocations during the year retail stores open at end of year recollections stores retail stores open at beginning of year retail stores opened during the year retail stores open at end the year star wholesale stores wholesale stores open at beginning of year wholesale store opened during the year wholesale store acquired during the year wholesale stores open at end of year total store count at end of year opening store counts reflect a reclassification of our los angeles combination wholesale retail store from a michaels store to a star wholesale store 
beginning in fiscal  our los angeles wholesale retail store is managed as part of our star wholesale concept 
in fiscal  we plan to open approximately michaels  two aaron brothers  and three recollections stores 
in march  we opened a new star wholesale store located in phoenix  arizona 
we plan to open approximately new michaels stores per year in subsequent fiscal years  extending into the foreseeable future 
in addition  we currently plan to open a limited number of aaron brothers stores per year in subsequent fiscal years 
our expansion strategy is to give priority to adding stores in existing markets in order to enhance economies of scale associated with advertising  distribution  field supervision  and other regional expenses 
the anticipated opening of michaels  aaron brothers  recollections  and star wholesale stores and the rate at which stores are opened will depend upon a number of factors  including the success of existing stores  the availability and the cost of capital for expansion  the availability of suitable store sites  and the ability to hire and train qualified managers 
we have developed a standardized store opening procedure that allows for the efficient opening of new stores and their integration into our information and distribution systems 
we develop the floor plan and merchandise layout and organize the advertising and promotions in connection with the opening of each new store 
in addition  we maintain qualified store opening teams to provide new store personnel with in store training 
costs for opening stores at particular locations depend upon the type of building and general cost levels in the area 
in fiscal  the average net cost of opening a new michaels store included approximately  of leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment  and pre opening costs  and an estimated initial inventory investment  net of accounts payable  of approximately  the total cost of opening a new store depends on the store size  operating format  and the time of year in which the store is opened 
the initial inventory investment in new michaels stores is offset  in part  by vendor allowances 
in addition to new store openings  we continue to pursue a store relocation program to improve the quality and performance of our existing store base 
we relocated and michaels stores in fiscal and  respectively  and one aaron brothers store in fiscal we plan to relocate approximately michaels stores during fiscal during fiscal and  we closed five michaels stores each year  and in fiscal  we closed one aaron brothers store 
we currently have no specific plans to close any aaron brothers  recollections  or star wholesale stores in fiscal and plan to close one michaels store 
investment in information technology we are committed to utilizing technology to increase operating efficiencies and to improve our ability to satisfy the needs of our customers 
the installation of the pos system gave us the ability to better understand the demands of our customers  emerging merchandise trends  and inventory replenishment requirements 
during fiscal  we completed installation of a networked computer system in every store to handle data communications  price management  enhanced radio frequency terminal applications for inventory management  faster credit card authorizations  and gift card processing 
in addition  a standardized warehouse management system utilizing radio frequency terminals with bar code scanning technology was installed in all distribution centers 
in connection with our supply chain initiatives  in fiscal  we implemented a new seasonal allocation system to better manage the allocation of seasonal merchandise to our stores based on prior year sales and current store sales trends 
in addition  in february  we completed the implementation of a new transportation management system to manage our transportation processes between our vendors  distribution centers  and stores 
as a result  we expect to increase efficiency and visibility of merchandise shipments within our supply chain 
in fiscal  we completed the rollout of our perpetual inventory system  and in fiscal we completed the rollout of our automated replenishment system 
our perpetual inventory and automated replenishment systems have improved our stores in stock positions  enhanced store labor efficiency  and improved forecasting of merchandise ordering quantities for our vendors 
we believe the implementation of these systems will continue to enhance our inventory management capabilities 
in addition to the information technology enhancements discussed above  in fiscal  we completed the rollout of a new human resource management system to all michaels stores 
in fiscal  we completed the rollout of our human resource management system to our aaron brothers stores 
in fiscal  we expect to substantially complete the installation of a new integrated financial management package to provide an efficient platform for future growth and utilize financial process best practices and controls

overview we are the largest national arts and crafts specialty retailer  with sales of almost billion in the united states and canada 
our primary retail business is our operation of michaels stores across north america 
we also operate three additional businesses our aaron brothers stores  a custom frame  framing  and art supply chain  our eight recollections stores  a scrapbooking paper crafting concept  and four star wholesale stores  a floral home d cor concept all store counts are as of march  
our mission is to help people express themselves creatively 
through our broad product assortments  friendly  knowledgeable sales associates  educational in store events  project sheets and displays  and on line information  we offer a shopping experience that encourages creativity in the areas of arts  crafts  floral displays  framing  home d cor  and children s hobbies and activities 
over the past eight years  we have focused on improving store operations and inventory management capabilities in our michaels stores while continuing a strong store growth program and developing new retail and wholesale concepts 
since fiscal  we have refined or implemented our inventory management system  point of sale system  warehouse management capabilities  transportation management system  seasonal merchandise allocation system  financial and human resource management systems  store merchandise planogram processes  and retail merchandising systems 
during fiscal  we completed the first phase of a two part project to further improve our inventory management capabilities 
the first phase involved implementing a perpetual inventory system in our michaels stores  which was completed in january in fiscal  we completed the implementation of the second phase of this project  the installation of an automated replenishment system for our basic  replenishable skus 
as a result of our focus on operations  we have improved our sales productivity and overall profitability 
during fiscal  we achieved same store sales growth of and opened new stores 
our operating margin improved from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal our improving operating and financial performance has resulted in a stronger financial position  which enabled us to continue declaring cash dividends and expanding our common stock repurchase program in fiscal additionally  our fiscal year end cash position increased to million  up million from the prior year 
in fiscal  one of our primary objectives will be to increase the sales and productivity of our michaels stores through improving our merchandise offering and enhancing the in store experience as part of our pursuit of the perfect store initiative 
in addition  we will continue to refine the business models of our aaron brothers  recollections  and star wholesale operations as we seek to continue their expansion 
also in fiscal  we plan to open approximately michaels stores  two aaron brothers stores  three recollections stores  and one star wholesale store  funded primarily by our available cash  funds generated by operating activities  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and these financial statements necessarily include some amounts that are based on our informed judgments and estimates 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates  and the disclosure in this section of this report regarding them  with the audit committee of our board of directors in connection with our fiscal financial statement closing process 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies represent those policies that are subject to judgments and uncertainties 
as discussed below  our financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of these policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
our critical accounting policies include merchandise inventories we value our inventories at michaels stores at the lower of cost or market as determined using a retail inventory method 
because we do not presently utilize perpetual inventory records to value inventory in our michaels stores  we are required to perform complete physical inventories for a significant sample of stores at the end of each fiscal quarter to estimate ending inventories valued at retail for all michaels stores to be used in our retail inventory model 
our sampling process is designed to count a selection of stores  which are representative of the size  age  and geographic location of the entire chain of stores 
an actual physical count of merchandise is made by third party inventory counting service firms in substantially every store each fiscal year 
we believe our sampling process results in a reasonable estimate of our retail inventory on hand at period end 
in determining our cost of goods sold and ending inventory at cost  we utilize a single pool of inventory for our michaels stores inventories 
with the implementation of our new perpetual inventory system  we are currently evaluating whether information from our perpetual inventory records  which is now used only for operational purposes  could be used to value our inventory for accounting purposes 
we currently plan to complete our evaluation by the end of fiscal our success in managing our inventories is dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for products and supplies used in creative activities 
if we misjudge the market  we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns 
permanent markdown reserves are recorded in the period in which we determine that markdowns will need to be taken to sell certain merchandise 
prior to fiscal  markdown reserves were generally determined based on retail counts of the affected merchandise on hand at a sample of stores 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  markdown reserves were determined based on a sample of stores perpetual inventory records 
in fiscal and going forward  markdown reserves are based on each store s perpetual inventory records 
amounts recorded for permanent markdown reserves are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill 
we perform annual impairment tests of goodwill by comparing the book values of our reporting units to their estimated fair values 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units are computed using estimates that include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
there are assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of fair value and any resulting impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce different results 
to date  we have not experienced any impairment of our goodwill  however  there can be no assurance that future impairment will not result should our operating results deteriorate for reasons such as those described under risk factors herein 
reserve for closed facilities we maintain a reserve for future rental obligations  carrying costs  and other closing costs related to closed facilities  primarily closed and relocated stores 
through the end of the third quarter of fiscal  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition of certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  our accounting policy was to record reserves for these obligations when management committed to closing or relocating a store or facility 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 costs associated with disposal activities  and began recognizing exit costs for any store closures at the time the store is closed 
while the adoption of sfas no 
did not change our policy for calculating store closure reserves  it does change the timing of the recognition of the related expense in future periods 
the cost of closing a store or facility is calculated as the lesser of the present value of future rental obligations remaining under the lease less estimated sublease rental income or the lease termination fee 
once a store has been identified for closure  we accelerate the remaining depreciation so the assets are fully depreciated at the date of closure 
the determination of the reserves is dependent on our ability to make reasonable estimates of costs to be incurred post closure and of rental income to be received from subleases 
in planning our store closures  we generally try to time our exits as close to the lease termination date as possible to minimize the need for sublease income to offset any remaining lease obligation 
the reserves could vary materially if market conditions were to vary significantly from our assumptions 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of our merchandise is recognized at the time of the merchandise sale  excluding revenue from the sale of custom frames  which is recognized at the time of delivery 
when calculating our deferred framing revenue  we currently estimate the length of time between the customer placing the order at the store and customer pick up based on the best available information from our systems 
we allow for merchandise to be returned under most circumstances and provide for a reserve of estimated returns 
a significant change in the length of time between the custom frame order and customer pick up or a significant change in the underlying trends of our sales returns may materially affect our future operating results 
we record a gift card liability on the date we issue the gift card to the customer 
we record revenue and reduce gift card liability as the customer redeems the gift card 
we escheat the value of unredeemed gift cards where required by law 
any remaining liabilities not subject to escheat are evaluated to determine whether the obligation is adequate to provide for future redemptions of gift cards 
to date  we have not recognized any revenues from expired or unredeemed gift cards in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we record income tax expense using the liability method for taxes and are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions  including the united states  various states and localities  and canada 
a current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on the tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
if different assumptions had been used  our tax expense  assets  and liabilities could have varied from recorded amounts 
if actual results differ from estimated results or if we adjust these assumptions in the future  we may need to adjust our deferred tax assets or liabilities  which could impact our effective tax rate 
general we report on the basis of a or week fiscal year  which ends on the saturday closest to january references to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year began 
fiscal ended on january   fiscal ended on january   and fiscal ended on february   and each contained weeks 
all references herein to fiscal relate to the weeks ending january  lease accounting correction based on certain views expressed in a letter of february  from the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission to the american institute of certified public accountants  we reviewed our accounting policies and practices associated with property leases 
consistent with industry practices  we historically reported straight line rental expense beginning on the earlier of the store opening date or the commencement date of the lease 
this had the effect of excluding the pre opening or build out period of our stores from the calculation of the period over which we expensed rent 
in addition  amounts received as tenant allowances were reflected in the balance sheet as a reduction to store leasehold improvement costs instead of classifying them as deferred lease credits 
following our review  we corrected our accounting policies such that we begin recording rent expense on the date we take possession of or control physical access to the premises 
we also recognize tenant allowances as a liability and accrete the liability as a reduction to rent expense over the same period in which rent expense is calculated 
as a result of these corrections  we recorded a non cash  million million  net of income tax cumulative adjustment to earnings during the fourth quarter of fiscal we also increased our gross property and equipment balances by million million  net of accumulated depreciation  our accrued liabilities by million  and other long term liabilities by million 
the increase in gross property and equipment reflects the reclassification of tenant allowances to other long term liabilities  which were previously reflected as a reduction of property and equipment 
the increase in other long term liabilities was to reflect the cumulative adjustment to the accrued rent balance and deferred lease credits related to tenant allowances 
we reduced our long term deferred income tax liability by million primarily as a result of a change in the cumulative timing differences related to deductions associated with straight line rent expense and leasehold amortization expense 
the adjustments did not impact historical or future net cash flows nor the timing of the payments under related leases 
we believe that the new lease accounting policies will not have a material effect on future diluted earnings per share 
prior years financial statements were not restated as the impact of these issues was immaterial to previously reported results for any individual prior year 
change in accounting principle in november  the eitf reached consensus on issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
issue addresses the accounting for cash consideration received by a customer from a vendor eg  slotting fees  cooperative advertising payments  buydowns and rebates or refunds from a vendor that are payable only if the customer completes a specified cumulative level of purchases or remains a customer for a specified time period 
issue is effective for new arrangements or modifications to existing arrangements entered into after december   although early adoption was permitted 
we elected to adopt early  effective february   the provisions of issue accordingly  in fiscal  we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of million million  net of income tax for the impact of this adoption on prior fiscal years 
this adoption also resulted in the reclassification of our cooperative advertising payments earned in fiscal from selling  general  and administrative expense to cost of sales and occupancy expense retroactively as of the beginning of fiscal the fiscal impact on income before cumulative effect of accounting change was immaterial 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of our consolidated statements of income 
this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes 
fiscal year net sales cost of sales and occupancy expense gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense store pre opening costs operating income interest expense other income and expense  net income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision for income taxes income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change for cooperative advertising allowances  net of income tax net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales increased million  or  from fiscal to fiscal net sales from our new stores opened during the year  partially offset by lost sales from our six store closures  accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
in addition  our fiscal comparable store sales increase of contributed million to the net sales increase 
comparable store sales growth was strongest in our needlework and yarn  kids crafts  impulse  framing  and art categories 
customer traffic increased and average ticket increased from fiscal to fiscal the increase in average ticket was driven primarily by the strengthening of the canadian dollar contributing basis points and favorable pricing product mix trends 
our ability to continue to generate comparable store sales increases is dependent  in part  on our ability to continue to maintain store in stock positions on the top selling items  to properly allocate merchandise to our stores  to effectively execute our pricing and sales promotion efforts  to anticipate customer demand and trends in the arts and crafts industry  and to respond to competitors activities 
cost of sales and occupancy expense cost of sales and occupancy expense increased million due to increased sales from a increase in the number of stores operated in fiscal compared to fiscal  as well as a comparable store sales increase 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales and occupancy expense were relatively constant 
in fiscal  we placed more emphasis on product displays to reduce the need for clearance markdowns  which strengthened our gross margins 
sales of regular priced merchandise  as a percentage of total sales  increased in fiscal  offset by a corresponding decrease in sales of both promotionally priced and clearance merchandise 
cost of sales was also favorably impacted by better leverage on our distribution expenses against higher net sales in fiscal these reductions in costs of sales  as a percentage of net sales  were largely offset by costs associated with our distribution center realignment  increases in occupancy expenses related to store closures  and the correction of our lease accounting policies 
the cost of closing our lexington  kentucky distribution center and opening a new distribution center in new lenox  illinois was approximately million 
all significant costs associated with this distribution center realignment project were recognized in fiscal occupancy expense in fiscal includes incremental store closure costs of approximately million over fiscal expense 
store closure costs vary with the timing and extent of store relocation and closure activities  and are driven primarily by the remaining lease term and estimated sublease income associated with each closed store 
in addition  we recorded a non cash million charge million  net of income tax  related to the correction of our lease accounting policies  as more fully explained in the preceding section entitled lease accounting correction 
selling  general  and administrative expense selling  general  and administrative expense was million  or of net sales in fiscal compared to million  or of net sales in fiscal the expense increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of stores we operated compared to last year 
in particular  store personnel costs  store operating expenses  advertising expenses  corporate overhead costs  and costs associated with relocating the aaron brothers headquarters to the dallas  texas area contributed million to the total million increase from fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we incurred million of higher workers compensation insurance costs  which includes a million reserve for claims that we believe will not be covered due to the deteriorating financial condition of an insurance company with which we previously conducted business 
the reserve amount represents our current estimate of probable loss as determined in consultation with third party experts 
our total gross claims exposure is estimated to be million  partially offset by estimated state guaranteed funds 
as actual claims continue to be filed with the insurer or as existing claims are fully resolved  it may be necessary for us to record additional adjustments in order to be fully reserved for the estimate of probable losses that we expect to incur  but we currently believe that all significant costs have been recognized in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  store personnel costs  excluding the workers compensation charges described above  and other operating costs decreased approximately basis points primarily as a result of a heightened focus on expense control during fiscal and a leveraging of those expenses on higher net sales 
in addition  advertising expense decreased approximately basis points in  primarily due to six less ad weeks than the previous year fewer newspaper ads  partially offset by eight additional circular ads 
these decreases were partially offset by the higher workers compensation costs described above of million  or basis points 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was in fiscal the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal was reduced from to primarily due to the resolution of an internal revenue service audit  bringing our full year effective tax rate to 
based on current projections  we believe our effective tax rate in fiscal will be between and 
net income as a result of the above  net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales increased million  or  from fiscal to fiscal fiscal net sales included sales from our new stores opened during the year  partially offset by lost sales from our five store closures  which accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
in addition  our fiscal comparable store sales increase of contributed million to the net sales increase 
comparable store sales growth was strongest in our scrapbooking  frames  seasonal  and general crafts categories 
customer traffic and average ticket each increased approximately from fiscal to fiscal the increase in average ticket was driven primarily by a strengthening of the canadian dollar contributing basis points and favorable pricing product mix trends 
cost of sales and occupancy expense cost of sales and occupancy expense  as a percentage of net sales  was relatively flat in fiscal compared to fiscal the overall increase in cost of sales and occupancy expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to fiscal new store growth and our comparable store sales increase of 
selling  general  and administrative expense selling  general  and administrative expense  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal store compensation costs decreased approximately basis points primarily as a result of a heightened focus on expense control during fiscal in addition  advertising and corporate general and administrative expenses were leveraged on higher net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the reduction in our fiscal effective tax rate was primarily due to the resolution of certain tax issues  most notably several issues surrounding our canadian subsidiary  which had been pending with the internal revenue service 
cumulative effect of accounting change in fiscal  we changed our accounting policy with respect to recording cooperative advertising allowances 
as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of income tax  in the first quarter of fiscal for the cumulative effect of accounting change on fiscal years prior to fiscal net income as a result of the above  net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in fiscal net income before the cumulative effect of accounting change for fiscal was million  or per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and equivalents increased million  or  from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal we require cash principally for day to day operations and to finance capital investments  inventory for new stores  inventory replenishment for existing stores  and seasonal working capital needs 
in recent years  we have financed our operations  new store openings  common stock repurchases  dividend payments  and other capital investments with cash from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises 
in addition  borrowings under our credit agreement may be an additional source of cash flow to finance future growth and other capital investments 
cash flow from operating activities cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due  in part  to an increase of million in net income as a result of sales growth and operating margin expansion  primarily as a result of a greater focus on expense control 
in addition  we used million less cash in fiscal compared to the prior year for merchandise inventories  net of accounts payable  primarily as a result of the timing of inventory purchases and related payments 
inventories per michaels store of million at january   decreased from million at january   as a result of the full implementation of our perpetual inventory and automated merchandise replenishment systems and the corresponding improvement in inventory management 
we used million less cash related to our income taxes payable  primarily due to tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock options and the timing of tax payments 
additionally  we used million less cash for accrued liabilities and other in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily related to the timing of payments 
cash flow from investing activities cash flow from investing activities was primarily the result of the following capital expenditure activities fiscal year in thousands new and relocated stores and stores not yet opened existing stores distribution system expansion  net of building reimbursements information systems corporate and other in fiscal  we incurred capital expenditures related to the opening of michaels  seven aaron brothers  and six recollections stores  and the relocation of michaels and one aaron brothers store 
in fiscal  we incurred capital expenditures related to the construction of our illinois distribution center  the opening of michaels  aaron brothers  two recollections  and one star wholesale store  and the relocation of michaels stores 
in fiscal  we incurred capital expenditures related to the completion of our hazleton  pennsylvania distribution center  the expansion of our lancaster  california distribution center  the opening of michaels and aaron brothers stores  and the relocation of michaels and one aaron brothers store 
in addition  we received a reimbursement in the amount of million for the expansion of our lancaster  california distribution center  which was completed in fiscal we currently estimate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal we anticipate spending approximately million to open approximately michaels  two aaron brothers  three recollections stores  and one star wholesale store  and approximately michaels store relocations  million for improvements in existing stores  million for new and existing distribution centers  million on information systems projects  and million for corporate expansion and various other capital investment activities 
we expect to spend on average approximately million to open a new michaels store  which includes  in net inventory and  of pre opening costs  and  to open a new aaron brothers store  which includes  in net inventory and  of pre opening costs 
we anticipate that our new michaels stores  as a group  will become profitable within their first months of operation 
during fiscal  we purchased interests in a massachusetts business trust that invests primarily in auction rate securities with auction reset periods of less than twelve months 
the purchase price of these interests was approximately million 
cash flow from financing activities beginning in june  michaels has declared quarterly cash dividends as follows declaration date payable date amount per share fiscal march  april  june  july  september  october  december  january  fiscal june  july  september  october  december  january  these dividends reflect the strength of our financial position and our board of directors commitment to encouraging long term investment by a diverse stockholder base 
we did not pay any dividends on our common stock prior to fiscal cash used for repurchases of our common stock increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal common stock repurchases were million in fiscal the following table sets forth information regarding our common stock repurchase plans as of january  shares shares authorized for shares available for repurchase repurchased repurchase december  repurchase plan fixed portion december  repurchase plan variable portion september  repurchase plan june  repurchase plan february  repurchase plan on december   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our outstanding common stock 
by later resolutions  our board of directors provided that proceeds of the exercise of options under our general stock option plan may be used to repurchase shares under the repurchase plan and that the maximum number of shares authorized to be repurchased under the repurchase plan may be increased to the extent necessary to so use the proceeds from such option exercises 
as of april  we had repurchased and subsequently retired a total of million shares under the repurchase plan at an average price of per share and  as a result  we have used the entire fixed portion of the authority originally provided in the repurchase plan 
in fiscal  we repurchased and subsequently retired  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share using proceeds from exercises of stock options granted under the general stock option plan that were exercised in fiscal as of january  we repurchased and subsequently retired the million shares of our common stock authorized under the repurchase plan at an average price of per share and  as a result  we have used the entire authority originally provided in the repurchase plan 
in fiscal  we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately million shares of our common stock authorized under the repurchase plan at an average price of per share 
in fiscal  we repurchased and subsequently retired  shares of our common stock authorized under the repurchase plan at an average price of per share and  as a result  we have used the entire authority originally provided in the repurchase plan 
in fiscal  we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately million shares of our common stock authorized to be repurchased under the repurchase plan at an average price of per share and  as a result  we had  shares available for repurchase under the plan as of january  we anticipate that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock in fiscal on march   our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase plan for up to million shares of our outstanding common stock 
under the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness  we can only repurchase shares of our common stock if we maintain or comply with specified financial ratios and other covenants 
we may also be restricted by regulations of the securities and exchange commission from making future repurchases during certain time periods 
proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options have served as a source of cash for us  and we expect to receive proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options and options to be granted under our stock option plans in the future 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options under our general stock option plan are required to be used to repurchase shares of our own common stock under the repurchase plan  except where not permitted by law or if there is a compelling need to use the proceeds for other corporate purposes 
debt in october  we signed an extension to our existing million unsecured revolving bank credit facility with fleet national bank and other lending institutions  which now expires on april  the credit agreement requires us to maintain certain financial covenants and limits certain activities  including  among other things  levels of indebtedness  liens  investments  payments of dividends  common stock repurchases  mergers and acquisitions  and sales of assets 
in addition to extending the term of the credit agreement  we obtained the consent of the lenders to permit the prepayment of the senior notes due when they become callable in july  if we have liquidity defined as cash and equivalents plus unused availability under the credit agreement of at least million 
based on our current cash projections  we anticipate calling our senior notes in july  which would result in a pre tax charge to earnings of million to be recognized in the period in which we prepay our senior notes  representing a combination of a prepayment penalty and the unamortized debt costs associated with the notes 
we are in compliance with all terms and conditions of the credit agreement 
during fiscal and  we had no borrowings under our credit agreement 
no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of january  or january  borrowings available under the credit agreement are reduced by the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement million as of january  
the following table sets forth certain data related to borrowings under our credit agreement fiscal year days of borrowings outstanding average outstanding borrowings in thousands weighted average interest rate general we believe that our available cash  funds generated by operating activities  funds available under the credit agreement  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options will be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures  working capital requirements  and any anticipated dividend payments or stock repurchases for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
contractual obligations all of our significant contractual obligations are fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully discussed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements  except for arrangements related to operating lease commitments  service contract commitments  and letters of credit  as disclosed in the table below 
in addition  it is not our normal policy to issue guarantees to third parties 
we currently have no commitments for capital leases and do not expect that to change in the immediate future 
as of january   our contractual obligations were as follows payments due by fiscal year less than more than total year years years years in thousands long term debt interest on long term debt operating lease commitments other commitments deferred compensation purchase obligations long term debt includes our senior notes due  which are first callable  in part or in full  in july we pay interest semi annually at a rate of per annum 
based on our current cash projections  we anticipate calling our senior notes in july  which would result in a pre tax charge to earnings of million to be recognized in the period in which we prepay our senior notes  representing a combination of a prepayment penalty and the unamortized debt costs associated with the notes 
our operating lease commitments generally include non cancelable leases for property and equipment used in our operations 
excluded from our operating lease commitments are amounts related to insurance  taxes  and common area maintenance associated with property and equipment 
such amounts historically represented approximately to per selling square foot over the previous five fiscal years 
other commitments primarily include service contract obligations  letters of credit  and certain post employment obligations 
our deferred compensation plan is fully funded and  as such  we have a plan asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet that substantially offsets the amount of our obligation 
additionally  there is no specific payment date under the terms of the plan 
therefore  we have excluded from this table our obligations pursuant to our deferred compensation plan 
our deferred compensation obligations of million were included in our consolidated balance sheet at january   within other long term liabilities 
purchase obligations represent legally binding commitments to purchase merchandise inventories  which are made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements 
additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our business is highly seasonal  with higher sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
for the last eight fiscal years  our fourth quarter  which includes the christmas selling season  has accounted for approximately of our sales and approximately of our operating income

to determine the impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
risk factors our growth depends on our ability to open new stores one of our key business strategies is to expand our base of retail stores 
if we were unable to implement this strategy  our ability to increase our sales  profitability  and cash flow could be impaired 
to the extent that we are unable to open new stores as we anticipate  our sales growth would come only from increases in comparable store sales 
growth in profitability in that case would depend significantly on our ability to reduce our costs as a percentage of our sales 
we may be unable to implement our strategy if we cannot identify suitable sites for additional stores  negotiate acceptable leases  access sufficient capital to support store growth  or hire and train a sufficient number of qualified associates 
our success will depend on how well we manage our growth even if we are able to implement  to a significant degree  our strategy of expanding our store base  or additionally  to expand our business through acquisitions or vertical integration opportunities  we may experience problems  which may prevent any significant increase in profitability or negatively impact our cash flow 
for example the costs of opening and operating new stores may offset the increased sales generated by the additional stores  the closure of unsuccessful stores may result in the retention of liability for expensive leases  a significant portion of our management s time and energy may be consumed with issues unrelated to advancing our core business strategy  which could possibly result in a deterioration of our operating results  our expansion may outpace our planned technological advances and current systems with the possible consequences of breakdowns in our supply chain management and reduced effectiveness of our operational systems and controls  we may be unable to hire  train  and retain qualified managers and other associates  our suppliers may be unable to meet the increased demand of additional stores in a timely manner  and we may be unable to expand our existing distribution centers or use third party distribution centers on a cost effective basis to provide merchandise for sale by our new stores 
we may fail to optimize or adequately maintain our perpetual inventory and automated replenishment systems we have completed the rollout of our perpetual inventory and automated replenishment systems  which we believe are necessary to properly forecast and manage our inventory levels and merchandise ordering quantities 
we may fail to properly optimize the effectiveness of these systems  or to adequately support and maintain the systems  which could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
improvements to our supply chain may not be fully successful an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies  cost reductions  and sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of improvements to our supply chain  including merchandise ordering  transportation  and receipt processing 
during fiscal  we will test a number of enhancements to our distribution systems with select suppliers  enabling us to evaluate our ability to distribute additional skus through our distribution centers 
significant changes to our supply chain could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
changes in customer demands could materially adversely affect our sales  operating results  and cash flow our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for products and supplies used in creative activities 
if we misjudge the market  we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns  which would have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flow 
however  shortages of key items could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
in addition  adverse weather conditions  unfavorable economic trends  and consumer confidence volatility could have a material adverse impact on our sales and operating results 
changes in consumer confidence could result in a reduction in consumer spending on items perceived to be discretionary our stores offer arts and crafts supplies and products for the crafter and do it yourself home decorator  which some customers may perceive as discretionary 
should their perception of the economy deteriorate  consumers may change spending patterns to reduce the amount spent on discretionary items 
our suppliers may fail us many of our suppliers are small firms that produce a limited number of items 
given their limited resources  these firms are susceptible to cash flow issues  production difficulties  quality control issues  and problems in delivering agreed upon quantities on schedule 
we cannot assure you that we would be able  if necessary  to return product to these suppliers and obtain refunds of our purchase price or obtain reimbursement or indemnification from them if their products prove defective 
in addition  these suppliers may be unable to withstand a downturn in economic conditions 
significant failures on the part of our key suppliers could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  many of these suppliers require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to supply products in the quantities we desire 
this long lead time requires us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale  exposing us to shifts in demand 
risks relating to foreign suppliers we rely to a significant extent on foreign manufacturers of various products that we sell 
in addition  many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources 
this reliance increases the risk that we will not have adequate and timely supplies of various products due to local political  economic  social  or environmental conditions  transportation delays including dock strikes and other work stoppages  restrictive actions by foreign governments  or changes in united states laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution 
reliance on foreign manufacturers also increases our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates including the potential revaluation of the chinese yuan and trade infringement claims and reduces our ability to return product for various reasons 
all of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the united states are subject to duties collected by the united states customs service 
we may be subjected to additional duties  significant monetary penalties  the seizure and the forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import  or the loss of import privileges if we or our suppliers are found to be in violation of us laws and regulations applicable to the importation of our products 
increases in transportation costs due to rising fuel costs the price of oil has risen significantly in the last year 
this increase and any future increases may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution to our stores as well as our vendors transportation costs 
our information systems may prove inadequate we depend on our management information systems for many aspects of our business 
we will be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or we are unable to improve  upgrade  maintain  and expand our systems  particularly in light of our continued significant increases in the number of stores 
a weak fourth quarter would materially adversely affect our operating results our business is highly seasonal 
our inventories and short term borrowings  if any  grow in the second and third fiscal quarters as we prepare for our peak selling season in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
our most important quarter in terms of sales  profitability  and cash flow historically has been the fourth fiscal quarter 
if for any reason our fourth fiscal quarter results were substantially below expectations  our operating results for the full year would be materially adversely affected  and we could have substantial excess inventory  especially in seasonal merchandise that is difficult to liquidate 
competition could negatively impact our operations the retail arts and crafts industry is competitive  which could result in the reduction of our prices and our loss of market share 
we must remain competitive in the areas of quality  price  breadth of selection  customer service  and convenience 
our primary competition is comprised of specialty arts and crafts retailers  which include hobby lobby  ac moore arts crafts  inc  jo ann superstores operated by jo ann stores  inc  and garden ridge corporation 
we also compete with mass merchants eg wal mart  who dedicate a portion of their selling space to a limited selection of craft supplies and seasonal and holiday merchandise  regional chains  and local merchants 
some of our competitors  particularly the mass merchants  are larger and have greater financial resources than we do 
in addition  alternative methods of selling crafts  such as over the internet  could result in additional competitors in the future and increased price competition since our customers could more readily comparison shop 
furthermore  we ultimately compete with alternative sources of entertainment and leisure for our customers 
the amount of debt we have could adversely affect us by reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions our needs for cash in the future will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict  including our results of operations and efforts to expand our existing operations 
we believe  based on current circumstances  that our available cash  funds generated by operating activities  together with available borrowings under our bank credit facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow at or above current levels 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to repay our debt as it becomes due and make necessary investments  we may be required to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  seek new borrowings  reduce or delay capital expenditures  reduce or eliminate dividends  sell assets  seek additional equity capital  or delay  scale back  or eliminate some aspects of our operations  including delaying our plans for new store openings 
moreover  it is possible that we may not be able to satisfy all of the conditions and covenants of our debt 
in addition  to the extent we seek to replace or refinance our current debt  replacement financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain acceptable financing upon the expiration of our bank credit facility 
our ability to obtain additional or replacement financing will be significantly impacted by  among other things  any changes in the ratings assigned to us by nationally recognized ratings agencies 
any of these events  if they were to occur  could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the covenant restrictions in our debt restrict our operations we and our subsidiaries are subject to significant operating and financial restrictions contained in the instruments governing the senior notes due and our other indebtedness 
those restrictions affect  and in many respects limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make various investments  issue or sell our restricted subsidiaries capital stock  engage in transactions with affiliates  make various distributions  sell or securitize accounts receivable  provide negative pledges  make capital expenditures beyond specific limitations  engage in derivative transactions other than in the ordinary course of business  create various liens  or merge  consolidate  and sell assets 
in addition  our credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
these restrictions could also limit our ability to obtain financing in the future  make needed capital expenditures  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general  or conduct necessary corporate activities 
if we or our subsidiaries fail to comply with these restrictions  we may be in default under the terms of our indebtedness  even if we are otherwise able to meet our debt service obligations 
in the event of a default  the holders of the indebtedness could elect to declare all of that indebtedness  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable and our other indebtedness may become immediately due and payable as a result of cross default clauses contained in documentation evidencing debt 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to make those payments or borrow sufficient funds from alternative sources to make those payments 
even if we were to obtain additional financing  that financing may be on terms unfavorable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements primarily in money market mutual funds and short term interest bearing securities  generally with maturities of days or less
