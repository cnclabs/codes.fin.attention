in addition  we have agreed to pay performance bonuses of up to million per year in each of and  provided certain significant revenue and gross margin targets are achieved

as a result of achieving certain performance targets for the periods ended december  and  we recognized  and  of bonus compensation expense  of which  was paid in in conjunction with the issuance of the  shares of common stock  we recognized  and  of stock compensation expense in and  respectively 
operations historically  we have derived our revenues almost exclusively from professional service fees that are billed at standard hourly rates on a time and expense basis 
revenues related to these services are recognized when the earnings process is complete and collectability is reasonably assured 
we also offer services related to large environmental claims for which our fee includes a significant performance based component 
due to the uncertainty regarding the amount and timing of performance based compensation  revenues from this service offering are recognized in the period when the earnings process is complete  and when we have received payment for the services we have performed under the contract 
these performance based expert fees have ranged from to of our quarterly total revenues 
in  performance based expert fees comprised approximately of our revenues 
revenues are comprised of fees for the services of our professional staff  fees for the services of our experts  performance based expert fees relating to environmental claims  and amounts we charge for services provided by others and reimbursable by clients  including travel  document reproduction  messenger services and other costs 
the following table summarizes our revenues from these sources by quarter from january  to december  three months ended unaudited mar

 in thousands expert and professional staff revenues performance based expert fees reimbursable expenses revenues compensation and project costs are comprised of salary  bonuses  taxes and benefits of all professional staff and a limited number of experts  compensation to experts as a percentage of their individual professional fees  compensation to experts based on specified revenue and gross margin performance targets  fees paid or to be paid to experts as project origination fees  costs that are reimbursable by clients  including travel  document reproduction  messenger services and other costs  and signing bonuses  including amortization expense associated with the hiring of experts and professional staff 
hourly fees charged by the professional staff that supports our experts  rather than the hourly fees charged by our experts  generate a majority of our gross profit 
under our business model  most of our experts are compensated based on a percentage of their billings from to  averaging approximately of their individual billings on particular projects in experts are paid when we have received payment from our clients 
any outstanding advances previously paid to experts are deducted from such payments 
because of the manner in which we pay our experts  our gross profit is significantly dependent on the margin on our professional staff services 
the number of professional staff assigned to a project will vary depending on the size  nature and duration of each engagement 
we manage our personnel costs by monitoring engagement requirements and utilization of the professional staff 
as an inducement to encourage experts to utilize our professional staff  experts generally receive project origination fees 
these fees are based primarily on a percentage of the collected professional staff fees 
historically  these fees have averaged of professional staff revenues 
experts are required  with some exceptions approved by us  to use our professional staff unless the skills required to perform the work are not available through us 
in these instances we engage outside individual or firm based consultants  who are typically compensated on an hourly basis 
both the revenue and the cost resulting from the services provided by these outside consultants are recognized in the period in which the services are performed 
such services constitute a small portion of our revenue and cost 
hiring of additional experts sometimes involves the payment of cash signing bonuses 
signing bonuses are generally amortized over the term defined in the employment agreement for the period during which they could be recovered from the employee if he or she were to leave us prior to a specified date 
most of our agreements allow us to recover signing bonuses over periods generally ranging from five to seven years 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenue includes all amounts earned that are billed or billable to clients  including reimbursable expenses  and have been reduced for amounts related to work performed that are estimated to be uncollectible 
expert revenues consist of revenues generated by experts who are our employees and revenues generated by experts who are independent contractors 
there is no operating  business or other substantive distinction between our employee experts and our exclusive independent contractor experts 
revenues primarily arise from time and material contracts  which are recognized in the period the services are performed 
we also enter into certain performance based contracts for which performance fees are dependent upon a successful outcome  as defined by the consulting engagement 
revenues related to performance based fee contracts are recognized in the period when the earnings process is complete  and when we have received payment for the services we performed under the contract 
revenues are also generated from fixed price contracts  which are recognized as the agreed upon services are performed 
such fixed price contract revenues are not a material component of total revenues 
equity based compensation we have recorded equity based compensation expense in connection with the vesting of some of our common stock option grants and restricted common stock sales 
we have granted options to employee experts and  to a lesser extent to professional staff 
equity based compensation expense for options granted to employees is determined under fixed plan accounting  which requires us to record expense when the exercise price of the options granted is less than the estimated fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
this amount is included as a component of stockholders equity and is amortized on a straight line basis by charges to earnings over the vesting period of the options 
historically  we also granted options to certain independent contractor experts  which were accounted for under variable plan accounting 
under variable plan accounting  equity based compensation expense is calculated for each accounting period based on the fair value of the options as determined by the black scholes option pricing model  which requires an estimate of the fair value of our underlying stock 
as a result  increases or decreases in the estimated fair value of our stock at the periodic measurement date had a corresponding increase or decrease in equity based compensation expense with respect to options accounted for under this method 
at the time of the management buyout  we sold restricted common stock to experts and management 
these restricted shares were subject to a right of repurchase that lapses over time 
similar to stock options  the method for determining stock based compensation expense for restricted common stock is dependent on the employment status of the individual who purchased the restricted common stock 
for restricted stock sold to independent contractors  variable plan accounting applies and equity based compensation expense is calculated quarterly for unvested shares as our right of repurchase lapses 
for employees  the difference between the purchase price and the estimated fair value of our stock on the date of purchase is included as a component of stockholders equity and is amortized on a straight line basis over the period we have a right to repurchase the restricted stock 
in december  we accelerated the vesting of certain options and restricted shares  including those issued to independent contractors  whose equity interests had generated a significant portion of the historical equity based compensation expense discussed above 
we accelerated the vesting of these stock options and restricted shares because i we had incurred material equity based compensation expense primarily due to variable accounting for options and restricted stock subject to vesting  that were issued to independent contractors  ii the uncertainty of the timing of equity based compensation expense to be incurred in future periods  and iii the likelihood that such amounts could continue to be material to our financial statements and could significantly impact our ability to raise future financing 
in conjunction with the decision to accelerate the vesting of certain options and restricted stock  holders entered into lock up agreements that prohibited the sale of such restricted shares and the shares issuable upon exercise of such options until such time as the options and restricted shares would have otherwise vested absent the acceleration 
such acceleration resulted in a total equity based compensation expense of million in the three months ended december  such acceleration substantially reduced equity based compensation expense in and had different assumptions or criteria been used to determine the estimated fair value of the common stock  materially different amounts of equity based compensation could have been reported 
provision for income taxes from september  to november   we operated as a limited liability company and were taxed as a partnership 
accordingly  lecg paid no significant income taxes on its own behalf during that period and there is no provision for income tax during the periods from september  to november  in our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our november initial public offering  we became a c corporation subject to federal and state income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas accounting for income taxes  under which deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
in accordance with sfas  a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining if it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the potential tax benefit represented by its deferred tax assets 
consideration is given to evidence such as the history of prior year taxable income  expiration periods for net operating losses and our projections 
our results for the quarter and year ended december  include an income tax benefit of million 
as a result of our conversion from a nontaxable limited liability corporation llc to a taxable c corporation as of our november  initial public offering  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we established the beginning balances in our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
our net deferred tax assets were comprised primarily of certain expert fees and equity based compensation amounts that were previously expensed for financial reporting purposes  but were not yet deducted for income tax purposes 
such amounts were required to be recognized through the income tax provision in the period of the change in our tax status 
based upon our results  and our estimates of and future results and completion of the llc income tax return  we determined that it was more likely than not  that we would realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets and  accordingly  a valuation allowance was not considered necessary 
we are entitled to a deduction for federal and state income taxes when non qualified stock options are exercised and stock purchased through our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  is sold prior to the end of a required holding period 
in  we recognized a total benefit from option exercises and disqualifying dispositions from our espp of  which reduced deferred tax assets and increased stockholders equity 
our effective tax rate is determined based on estimates of worldwide pre tax income  permanent differences and credits  and reviewed quarterly to determine if actual results require modifying the effective tax rate 
our actual effective tax rate for was 
goodwill and identifiable intangibles goodwill was recorded at the time of the management buyout in september additional goodwill and identifiable intangible were recorded related to acquisitions made through december  we determined that we have one reporting unit based on the similarity of operations throughout our individual offices 
business acquisitions have been integrated within the structure of the organization and all the individual offices share similar economic characteristics and do not represent separate reporting units 
we assess the impairment of goodwill at least annually  and whenever events or significant changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider important in determining whether to perform an impairment review include significant under performance relative to forecasted operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable  then we will assess impairment based on a projection of undiscounted future cash flows and measure the amount of impairment based on fair value 
we have used a discounted cash flow model derived from internal budgets in assessing fair values for our goodwill impairment testing 
factors that could change the result of our goodwill impairment test include  but are not limited to  different assumptions used to forecast future revenues  expenses  capital expenditures and working capital requirements used in our cash flow models 
in addition  selection of a risk adjusted discount rate on the estimated undiscounted cash flows is susceptible to future changes in market conditions  and when unfavorable  can adversely affect our original estimates of fair values 
for the annual impairment test  we used the quoted market price of our common stock and compared our fair value to our book value 
at december  and  we concluded that there was no impairment in our goodwill 
intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have determinable useful lives are valued separately and amortized over their expected useful lives 
intangible assets consist principally of customer related intangibles and are generally amortized over six to months 
we assess the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as part of our assessment  we review the discounted expected future cash flows to be generated by the assets 
at december  and  we concluded that there was no impairment in our intangible assets 
results of operations comparability of financial results the following impacts the comparability of our financial results for as compared to and prior to november   no income taxes were recorded or paid at the corporate level 
in prior periods we operated as a limited liability company and taxes were paid at the individual stockholder level not by us 
our change in tax status at november  resulted in a million tax benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes in prior to november   we incurred preferred stock accretion and dividends on our outstanding preferred units 
those preferred units were redeemed in full in connection with our initial public offering 
in  they impacted the calculation of net income attributable to common shareholders and earnings per share 
basic and diluted earnings per share for include the impact of  shares sold in our initial public offering on november  and the impact of  shares sold in our secondary public offering on december   since their respective issuance dates 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in this increase included a million  or  increase in expert and professional staff revenues  excluding performance based services 
the increase in expert and professional staff revenues resulted from a increase in the number of expert and professional staff billable hours  in addition to an increase in the average hourly billing rate due to rate increases and changes in the expert and staff mix 
underlying this growth is the addition of experts and professional staff members in as a result of our recruitment efforts  acquisitions of the businesses of low rosen taylor soriano and economic analysis llc in march  silicon valley expert witness group  inc in august  washington advisory group in october  and our expansion in europe 
our international operations contributed million to the overall growth in revenues in and revenues from our international operations represent of total revenue as compared to in this increase was partially offset by a million  or decrease in expert revenues from our performance based services  to million in from million in cost of services compensation and project costs 
compensation and project costs in increased million  or  to million from million in expert and professional staff compensation increased million as we added experts and professional staff in our growth in revenues contributed to the increase in expert compensation  as a majority of our experts are paid a percentage of their own billings plus a percentage of professional staff billings 
due to increases in base salaries in  and to align bonus compensation with our lower utilization rates  we reduced bonus compensation for professional staff by million 
also contributing to the increase in cost of services is the amortization of signing bonuses of million in  representing an increase of million from million in as a consequence of our successful recruiting efforts 
compensation and project costs also include project origination fees  which increased million or to million in from million in consistent with the growth in professional staff revenues 
equity based compensation 
equity based compensation in decreased million  to  from million in due primarily to the associated variable accounting effect of certain restricted shares and options subject to performance based vesting combined with lower prices for our stock in compared to the primary source of our variable accounting expense decrease has been restricted shares subject to a non recourse note 
the note was repaid in may  thereby eliminating any future impact of variable accounting resulting from these restricted shares 
offsetting the  benefit of shares and options subject to variable accounting is  of amortization expense associated with options and restricted stock issued with exercise prices less than the fair market value on the date of grant 
such options and restricted stock were issued to employees prior to our initial public offering in november operating expenses operating expenses in increased million  or  to million from million in the increase was due in part to increases in administrative personnel and related payroll costs of million 
operating expenses for the year ended december  include a reduction in bonus compensation of million  as compared to  to reflect increases in base salaries in and to align bonus compensation with our performance for corresponding personnel costs  and recruiting fees in connection with hiring experts and professional staff  increased million  due in part to our successful recruiting efforts in we anticipate we will continue to incur fees for recruiting as we pursue our growth strategy of attracting high level experts and professional staff 
also contributing to the increase in operating expenses is an increase in facilities costs of million in connection with the expansion of existing offices and the opening of five new offices since december  the use of outside professional services increased by million over resulting from increased legal  accounting and tax consulting fees  which were due in part to start up services performed for our european operations  the nera litigation  general corporate matters and costs associated with our public company status including our sarbanes oxley compliance effort and tax compliance services

marketing and related costs increased million as the result of increased business development efforts 
insurance costs increased  due in part to our status as a public company and our expansion 
interest expense interest expense in decreased million  to  from million in the decrease was due to the absence of outstanding borrowings on both the revolving credit facility and the term loan throughout as the result of repaying the outstanding balances in november interest expense is comprised primarily of amortization of fees paid in connection with our credit facility 
income taxes from september  to november   we operated as a limited liability company and were taxed as a partnership 
accordingly  we paid no significant income taxes on our own behalf during the periods from september  to november  in our consolidated financial statements

the increase in expert and professional staff revenues resulted from a increase in the number of expert and professional staff billable hours which includes the impact of the august acquisition of cfes  in addition to a increase in the average hourly billing rate due to rate increases and changes in the expert and staff mix 
in addition  expert revenues from our performance based services increased million to million in from million in cost of services compensation and project costs 
compensation and project costs in increased million  or  to million from million 
compensation and project costs increased as a consequence of our growth in revenues because experts are paid a percentage of their own billings plus a percentage of professional staff billings 
in addition  average expert and professional staff headcount for the year increased by people to in from in compensation and project costs include project origination fees of million for  representing an increase of  or  over equity based compensation 
equity based compensation in decreased million to million from million in the decrease reflects the effect of the accelerated vesting of certain options and restricted stock in the fourth quarter of that had generated a significant portion of equity based compensation prior to the acceleration of vesting 
contributing to the million of equity based compensation in was  resulting from accelerating the vesting  pursuant to their terms  of certain options issued in to david j

total offering costs of million incurred in connection with our november initial public offering were offset against the proceeds from the offering 
interest expense interest expense in decreased  or  to million from million in the decrease  due to the repayment of our revolving line of credit and term loan in november and lower variable interest rates in  was partially offset by higher loan balances throughout most of income tax benefit as a result of our conversion from an llc to a corporation on november   deferred tax assets of million were recognized in the fourth quarter of we believed it was more likely than not that the results of future operations would generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred assets

as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  primarily in money market accounts  and no outstanding bank borrowings 
our primary financing need will continue to be to fund our growth 
an important element of our growth strategy is the recruitment of additional experts and our expansion into new geographical areas and consulting practice areas 
we expect to continue to search for and acquire top level experts  in order to deepen our existing service offerings and to add new experts and related professional staff to new practice areas 
prior to our initial public offering  our primary source of liquidity had been borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities  supplemented by cash flows from operating activities 
our current sources of cash are the remaining proceeds from our initial and secondary public offerings and cash generated by operations  which have been augmented by the proceeds from option exercises and the sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan

in connection with our march acquisition of lrts  we paid million in february we will make additional payments of up to million from to if specified profitability targets are achieved 
in connection with the hiring of certain experts and professional staff in march  we have agreed to pay performance bonuses of up to million per year in each of and provided certain significant revenue and profitability targets are achieved 
all such bonus payments are subject to amortization from the time the bonus is earned through march in connection with our march acquisition of cfes  we will pay million in august as certain specified revenue and profitability targets were achieved for  and if certain specified revenue and profitability targets are met in the future  we will make additional payments of approximately million in each of and in addition  if certain performance targets are met  we will pay bonus compensation ranging from  to  per year from to the following table provides summary information concerning our future contractual and contingent obligations and commitments  including the acquisitions and expert hires disclosed above and other contingent commitments relating to other expert agreements

factors that may affect future operating results  financial condition and the market price of our stock set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
the following risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our operations 
the occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations and should be considered in evaluating our future performance 
our financial results could suffer if we are unable to successfully attract  integrate and retain our experts and professional staff 
similar to professional service firms  many of our clients are attracted to lecg by their desire to engage individual experts  and the ongoing relationship with our clients is often managed primarily by our individual experts 
if an expert terminates his or her relationship with us  it is probable that most of the clients and projects for which that expert is responsible will continue with the expert  and the clients will terminate their relationship with us 
we generally do not have non competition agreements with any of our experts and as a result  experts can terminate their relationship with us at any time and immediately begin to compete against us 
our top five experts together accounted for of our revenues during if any of these individuals or our other experts terminate their relationship with us or compete against us  it could materially harm our business and financial results 
in addition  if we are unable to attract  develop  motivate and retain highly qualified experts  professional staff and administrative personnel  our ability to adequately manage and staff our existing projects and obtain new projects could be impaired  which would adversely affect our business and its prospects for growth 
qualified professionals are in great demand  and we face significant competition for both senior and junior professionals with the requisite credentials and experience 
our competition comes from other consulting firms  research firms  governments  universities and other similar enterprises 
many of these competitors may be able to offer significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices  career paths or geographic locations than we do 
increasing competition for these professionals may also significantly increase our labor costs  which could negatively affect our margins and results of operations 
the loss of the services of  or the failure to recruit  a significant number of experts  professional staff or administrative personnel could harm our business  including our ability to secure and complete new projects 
our financial results could suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain high utilization and billing rates for our professional staff 
our profitability depends to a large extent on the utilization and billing rates of our professional staff 
utilization of our professional staff is affected by a number of factors  including the number and size of client engagements  our experts use of professional staff to perform the projects they obtain from clients and the nature of specific client engagements  some of which require greater professional staff involvement than others  the timing of the commencement  completion and termination of projects  which in many cases is unpredictable  our ability to transition our professional staff efficiently from completed projects to new engagements  our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate level of professional staff  and conditions affecting the industries in which we practice as well as general economic conditions 
the billing rates of our professional staff that we are able to charge are also affected by a number of additional factors  including the quality of our expert services  the market demand for the expert services we provide  our competition and the pricing policies of our competitors  and general economic conditions 
if we are unable to achieve and maintain high utilization as well as maintain or increase the billing rates for our professional staff  our financial results could suffer materially 
if we are unable to manage the growth of our business successfully  our financial results and business prospects could suffer 
since the management buyout we have experienced significant growth in the number of our experts and professional staff 
we have also expanded our practice areas and have opened offices in new locations 
we may not be able to successfully manage a significantly larger and more geographically diverse workforce as we increase the number of our experts and professional staff and expand our practice areas 
additionally  growth increases the demands on our management  our internal systems  procedures and controls 
to successfully manage growth  we must add administrative staff and periodically update and strengthen our operating  financial and other systems  procedures and controls  which will increase our costs and may reduce our profitability 
this need to augment our support infrastructure due to growth was compounded by our decision to become a public reporting company  and the increased expense that arises in complying with existing and new regulatory requirements 
we must be able to prepare accurate and timely financial information  particularly as it relates to the on going obligations of a public company 
we have designed our internal disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that these disclosure controls and procedures will meet their objectives  however  even well designed and operated disclosure controls and procedures are susceptible to inherent limitations 
these inherent limitations potentially include faulty assumptions in the design of the controls and procedures  fraud by individuals and errors or mistakes by those overseeing the controls procedures 
as a result  we may be unable to successfully implement improvements to our information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls 
moreover  as we acquire new businesses  we will need to integrate their financial reporting systems into ours  including our disclosure controls and procedures 
we may experience difficulties in integrating new businesses  which could impair the overall quality of the information produced by our financial reporting systems 
any failure to successfully manage growth or maintain adequate internal disclosure controls and procedures could harm our financial results and business prospects 
revenue from our performance based fee service offering is difficult to predict 
performance based expert fees have ranged from to of our quarterly total revenues 
because these fees are dependent on the amounts recovered by our clients  revenue on such cases  which is recognized generally on receipt  is not certain  the timing of recovery is difficult to predict  and revenue may not arrive evenly through the year  or at all  thereby affecting our quarterly and annual results 
we depend on the complex damages  competition policy antitrust and environmental claims consulting practice areas  which could be adversely affected by changes in the legal  regulatory and economic environment 
our business is heavily concentrated in the practice areas of complex damages  competition policy antitrust  including mergers and acquisitions  and environmental claims 
projects in our complex damages practice area accounting for and of our billings in and  respectively 
projects in our competition policy antitrust practice area  including mergers and acquisitions  accounted for and of our billings in and  respectively 
projects in our environmental claims practice area accounted for and of our billings in and  respectively 
changes in the federal antitrust laws or the federal regulatory environment  changes in environmental laws or changes in judicial interpretations of these laws could substantially reduce the need for expert consulting services in these areas 
this would reduce our revenues and the number of future projects in these practice areas 
in addition  adverse changes in general economic conditions  particularly conditions influencing the merger and acquisition activity of larger companies  could also negatively impact the number and scope of our projects in proceedings before the department of justice and the federal trade commission 
additional hiring and acquisitions could disrupt our operations  increase our costs or otherwise harm our business 
our business strategy is dependent in part upon our ability to grow by hiring individuals or groups of experts and by acquiring other expert services firms 
however  we may be unable to identify  hire  acquire or successfully integrate new experts and consulting practices without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial problems 
and  we may be unable to achieve the financial  operational and other benefits we anticipate from any hiring or acquisition 
hiring additional experts or acquiring other expert services firms could also involve a number of additional risks  including the diversion of management s time  attention and resources  especially since dr 
teece  our chairman  and mr 
kaplan  our president  also provide consulting services that account for a significant amount of our revenues  loss of key acquired personnel  the incurrence of signing bonuses  which could adversely impact our profitability and cash flow  potential impairment of existing relationships with our experts  professionals and clients  the creation of conflicts of interest that require us to decline engagements that we otherwise could have accepted  increased costs to improve  coordinate or integrate managerial  operational  financial and administrative systems  increased costs associated with the opening and build out of new offices  or redundant offices in the same city where consolidation is not immediately possible  dilution of our stock as a result of issuing equity securities in connection with hiring new experts or acquiring other expert services firms  and difficulties in integrating diverse corporate cultures 
we have encountered these risks after hiring individuals and groups of experts and acquiring expert practices  and we anticipate that we will encounter these risks in connection with future hirings and acquisitions 
competition for future hiring and acquisition opportunities in our markets could increase the compensation we offer to potential experts or the price we pay for businesses we wish to acquire 
in addition  this increased competition could make it more difficult to retain our experts 
the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
projects may be terminated suddenly  which may negatively impact our financial results 
our projects generally center on decisions  disputes  proceedings or transactions in which clients are seeking expert advice and opinions 
our projects can terminate suddenly and without advance notice to us 
our clients may decide at any time to settle their disputes or proceedings  to abandon their transactions or to take other actions that result in the early termination of a project 
our clients are under no contractual obligation to continue using our services 
if an engagement is terminated unexpectedly  or even upon the completion of a project  our professionals working on the engagement may be underutilized until we assign them to other projects 
the termination or significant reduction in the scope of a single large engagement could negatively impact our results of operations 
conflicts of interest could preclude us from accepting projects 
we provide our services primarily in connection with significant or complex decisions  disputes and regulatory proceedings that are usually adversarial or involve sensitive client information 
our engagement by a client may preclude us from accepting projects with our clients competitors or adversaries because of conflicts of interest or other business reasons 
as we increase the size of our operations  the number of conflict situations can be expected to increase 
moreover  in many industries in which we provide services  for example the petroleum industry  there has been a continuing trend toward business consolidations and strategic alliances 
these consolidations and alliances reduce the number of companies that may seek our services and increase the chances that we will be unable to accept new projects as a result of conflicts of interest 
if we are unable to accept new assignments for any reason  our professional staff may become underutilized  which would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in future periods 
our ability to maintain and attract new business depends upon our reputation  the professional reputation of our experts and the quality of our services on client projects 
our ability to secure new projects depends heavily upon our reputation and the individual reputations of our experts 
any factor that diminishes our reputation or that of our experts could make it substantially more difficult for us to attract new projects and clients 
similarly  because we obtain many of our new projects from clients that we have worked with in the past or from referrals by those clients  any client that questions the quality of our work or that of our experts could seriously impair our ability to secure additional new projects and clients 
in litigation  we believe that there has been an increase in the frequency of challenges made by opposing parties to the qualifications of experts 
in the event a court or other decision maker determines that an expert is not qualified to serve as an expert witness in a particular matter  then this determination could harm the expert s reputation and ability to act as an expert in other engagements which could in turn harm our business reputation and our ability to obtain new engagements 
our engagements could result in professional liability  which could be very costly and hurt our reputation 
our projects typically involve complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment 
as a result  we are subject to the risk of professional liability 
many of our projects involve matters that could have a severe impact on a client s business  cause a client to gain or lose significant amounts of money or assist or prevent a client from pursuing desirable business opportunities 
if a client questions the quality of our work  the client could threaten or bring a lawsuit to recover damages or contest its obligation to pay our fees 
litigation alleging that we performed negligently or breached any other obligations to a client could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 
we carry professional liability insurance to cover most of these types of claims  but the policy limits and the breadth of coverage may be inadequate to cover any particular claim or all claims plus the cost of legal defense 
for example  we provide services on engagements in which the amounts in controversy or the impact on a client may substantially exceed the limits of our errors and omissions insurance coverage 
if we are found to have professional liability with respect to work performed on such an engagement  we may not have sufficient insurance to cover the entire liability 
litigation  regardless of the outcome  is often very costly  could result in distractions to our management and experts and could harm our business and our reputation 
intense competition from economic  business and financial consulting firms could hurt our business 
the market for expert consulting services is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and subject to rapid change 
many of our competitors are national and international in scope and have significantly greater personnel  financial  technical and marketing resources 
in addition  these competitors may generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition than we do 
we may be unable to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with any new competitors 
there are relatively low barriers to entry  and we have faced and expect to continue to face additional competition from new entrants into the economic  business and financial consulting industries 
in the litigation and regulatory expert services markets  we compete primarily with economic  business and financial consulting firms and individual academics 
expert services are also available from a variety of participants in the business consulting market  including general management consulting firms  the consulting practices of major accounting firms  technical and economic advisory firms  regional and specialty consulting firms  small niche consulting companies and the internal professional resources of companies 
we are subject to additional risks associated with international operations 
we currently have operations in argentina  australia  belgium  canada  france  new zealand  south korea  spain and the united kingdom 
in  of our revenues was attributable to activities outside of the united states  and in  of our revenues was attributable to activities outside the united states 
we may continue to expand internationally and our international revenues may account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future 
our international operations carry special financial and business risks  including greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations  less stable political and economic environments  cultural differences that adversely affect utilization  currency fluctuations that adversely affect our financial position and operating results  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  civil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity  and greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
the occurrence of any one of these factors could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
our disputes with navigant consulting  inc and national economic research associates  inc could harm our business and financial results 
we have a dispute with navigant consulting  inc arising out of our management led buyout of certain of the assets and liabilities of lecg  inc from navigant consulting and lecg  inc in the management led buyout  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of lecg  inc pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with navigant consulting and lecg  inc dated september  under the asset purchase agreement  up to million of the purchase price was deferred contingent upon whether specific individuals listed on a schedule to the asset purchase agreement had an employment  consulting  contracting or other relationship with us on september  navigant consulting contends that it is entitled to a payment of approximately million plus interest with respect to the contingent purchase price amount 
on several occasions before and after september   we notified navigant consulting that several of the individuals listed on the schedule to the asset purchase agreement did not have an employment  consulting  contracting or other relationship with us on september  if navigant consulting initiates legal proceedings against us  a decision against us could harm our financial results and financial position 
in june  national economic research associates  inc  or nera  and its parent company  marsh mclennan companies  inc  filed a complaint against us and one of our experts 
this action arises out of our hiring of professionals in march who were formerly employed by nera in the united states and europe 
the complaint alleges that during and after his employment with nera  this expert violated contractual commitments and fiduciary duties to nera 
the complaint further alleges that we interfered with nera s contractual relations and advantageous business relationship  misappropriated confidential business information and goodwill  and engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices 
the complaint asks for unspecified damages and disgorgement of wrongful gain  invalidation of an indemnification agreement provided to this expert by us and contains a demand for a jury trial 
in august  we served a motion to dismiss the complaint with respect to the breach of contract  tortious interference with contractual relations and the unfair and deceptive trade practices counts  which motion is fully briefed and pending decision by the court 
we also filed our answer to the complaint 
a decision against us in this case could harm our financial results and financial position 
our financial results could suffer if we are unable to retain certain experts whose options and restricted stock vesting was accelerated 
in december  we accelerated the vesting of  stock options held by experts and the acceleration of the vesting of  shares of restricted stock held by experts 
these accelerated options and restricted shares are subject to a lock up agreement under which the shares issuable upon exercise of the options and the restricted shares cannot be sold until such time as the options and restricted shares would have otherwise vested absent the acceleration 
the acceleration of the vesting of such stock options and shares of restricted stock could make it more difficult for us to retain the services of experts holding them as such experts may have less incentive to continue their relationship with us 
furthermore  if an expert terminates employment prior to the time that such options or restricted stock would have vested  we would incur significant additional compensation expense for the period in which the expert left  in the amount of the fair market value of the options or stock at the time of acceleration minus the amounts previously expensed 
we operate as a publicly traded corporation rather than as a privately held limited liability company  which could make it more costly for us to operate our business 
prior to november   we operated as a privately held limited liability company 
operating as a publicly traded c corporation imposes new costs and challenges on us 
these include the preparation and filing of federal and state income tax returns and other tax filings  the filing of quarterly and annual reports with the sec  the need for more expensive directors and officers liability insurance and the need for more services from our outside auditors in connection with periodic public filings and earnings announcements 
in addition  we will need to invest more in the function of investor relations to communicate with investors and the general public 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated widely and may continue to do so  depending upon many factors  including but not limited to the risk factors listed above and the following the limited trading volume of our common stock on the nasdaq national market  variations in our quarterly results of operations  the hiring or departure of key personnel  including experts  our ability to maintain high utilization of our professional staff  announcements by us or our competitors  the loss of significant clients  changes in our reputation or the reputations of our experts  acquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors  changes in the legal and regulatory environment affecting businesses to which we provide services  changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts  inability to meet quarterly or yearly estimates or targets of our performance  and market conditions in the industry and the economy as a whole 
we are controlled by our management and members of our board of directors  who will be able to influence significant corporate events 
our executive officers and members of our board of directors beneficially own approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
as a result  our executive officers and directors will be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote  including the election of directors and the approval of significant transactions 
the issuance of preferred stock could discourage or prevent an acquisition of our company  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the preferences  limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series  without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the preferred stock could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock 
the potential issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a person to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock  and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of us  discourage bids for our common stock over the market price and adversely affect the market price and the relative voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 
our charter documents and delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
for example  our charter documents prohibit stockholder actions by written consent 
in addition  the provisions of section of delaware general corporate law govern us 
these provisions may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
these and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and under delaware law could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash investment policy we have established cash investment guidelines consistent with the objectives of preservation and safety of funds invested  ensuring liquidity and optimizing yield on investment 
eligible investments include money market accounts  us treasuries  us agency securities  commercial paper  municipal bonds  aaa rated asset backed securities  certificates of deposit and agency backed mortgage securities 
we seek the highest quality credit rating available for each type of security used for investment purposes 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly since the majority of our investments are short term in nature 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure 
our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds 
the recorded carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to their short maturities 
our long term debt agreement calls for interest to be charged at variable rates 
we had no outstanding long term debt during if the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by basis points in  interest expense would not have been different from that reported 
currency risk we currently have international operations in argentina  australia  belgium  canada  france  new zealand  south korea  spain and the united kingdom 
the functional currency in each location is the local currency 
fluctuations in exchange rates of the us dollar against foreign currencies may result in foreign exchange gains and losses 
if exchange rates on such currencies were to fluctuate  we believe that our results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected
