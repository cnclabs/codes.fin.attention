item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations comparison of operating results for the years ended december   and by business segment 
eft processing products and services outsourced management solutions euronet offers outsourced management services to banks and other organizations using our processing centers electronic financial transaction processing software 
our outsourced management services include management of existing bank networks of atms  development of new atm networks on a complete turn key basis  management of pos networks  management of credit and debit card databases and other financial processing services 
these services include hour monitoring from our processing centers of each individual atm s status and cash condition  coordinating the cash delivery and management of cash levels in the atm and automatic dispatch for necessary service calls 
they also include real time transaction authorization  advanced monitoring  network gateway access  network switching  hour customer services  maintenance services  settlement  cash forecasting and reporting 
we already provide these services to existing customers and we have invested in the necessary infrastructure to support many additional transactions 
as a result  any new outsourced management services agreements should provide additional revenue with lower incremental cost 
our outsourced management agreements  other than in germany  generally provide for fixed monthly management fees and in most cases fees payable for each transaction 
the transaction fees under these agreements are generally lower than under card acceptance agreements  described below 
the fees payable under our outsourced management agreements in germany are purely transaction based and include no fixed component 
euronet branded atm transaction processing euronet has a network of atms in central european countries that are branded as euronet atms 
to manage this atm network  our operations center uses our software solutions segment s integrated transaction management core software solution 
the atms in our networks are able to process transactions for holders of credit and debit cards issued by or bearing the logos of banks and international card organizations such as american express  diners club international  visa  mastercard and europay 
this ability is accomplished through our agreements and relationships with these banks  international credit and debit card issuers and international associations of card issuers 
in a typical atm transaction  the transaction is routed from the atm to our processing center  and then to the card issuer for authorization 
once authorization is received  the authorization message is routed back to the atm and the transaction is completed 
the card issuer is responsible for authorizing atm transactions processed on our atms 
when a bank cardholder conducts a transaction on a euronet owned atm  we receive a fee from the cardholder s bank for that transaction 
the bank pays us this fee either directly or indirectly through a central switching and settlement network 
when paid indirectly  this fee is referred to as the interchange fee 
all of the banks in a shared atm and pos switching system establish the amount of the interchange fee by agreement 
we receive transaction processing fees for successful transactions and  in certain circumstances  for transactions that are not completed because they fail to receive authorization 
the fees paid to us by the card issuers are independent of any fees charged by the card issuers to cardholders in connection with the atm transactions 
we do not charge cardholders a transaction or access fee for using our atms 

table of contents we generally receive fees from our customers for four types of transactions that are processed on our atms cash withdrawals balance inquiries transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization prepaid telecommunication recharges card acceptance or sponsorship agreements our agreements with banks and international card organizations generally provide that all credit and debit cards issued by the customer bank or organization may be used at all atm machines we operate in a given market 
in most markets  we have agreements with a bank under which we are designated as a service provider which we refer to as sponsorship agreements for the acceptance of cards bearing international logos  such as visa and mastercard 
these card acceptance or sponsorship agreements allow us to receive transaction authorization directly from the card issuing bank or international card organization 
our agreements generally provide for a term of three to seven years and are automatically renewed unless either party provides notice of non renewal prior to the termination date 
in some cases  the agreements are terminable by either party upon six months notice 
we are generally able to connect a bank to our network within to days of signing a card acceptance agreement 
generally  the bank provides the cash needed to complete transactions on the atm  although we have contracted for cash supply with a cash supply bank in the czech republic 
under our card acceptance agreements  the atm transaction fees we charge vary depending on the type of transaction and the number of transactions attributable to a particular card issuer 
our agreements generally provide for payment in local currency 
transaction fees are sometimes denominated in us dollars or are adjusted for inflation 
transaction fees are billed to banks and card organizations with payment terms no longer than one month 
other products and services our network of owned or operated atms allows for the sale of financial and other products or services at a low incremental cost 
we have developed value added services in addition to basic cash withdrawal and balance inquiry transactions 
these new services include bill payment  mini statement and recharge purchasing prepaid airtime from atm and mobile phone devices transactions 
we are committed to the ongoing development of innovative new products and services to offer our eft processing customers and intend to implement additional services as markets develop 
in poland  hungary  croatia  romania  the czech republic  the uk  egypt  india and indonesia  we have established electronic connections to some or all of the major mobile phone operators 
these connections permit us to transmit to them electronic requests to recharge mobile phone accounts 
we have either established or adapted networks of atms in these markets to offer customers of the mobile operators the ability to credit their prepaid mobile phone accounts 
we began to distribute prepaid mobile telephone vouchers on our networks in hungary and poland in november in may and october  we added this service to our czech republic and croatian atm networks  respectively 
in poland  hungary  croatia and indonesia  we have contracts with all of the local mobile operators 
we include transaction fees payable under the electronic recharge solutions that we distribute through our atms in eft processing segment revenues 
fees for recharge transactions vary substantially from market to market and are based on the specific prepaid solution and the denomination of prepaid usage purchased 
any or all of these fees may come under pricing pressure in the future 
in an automatic atm recharge transaction  our atm prompts a consumer through a series of atm screens  during which the customer s credit or debit card is used to make payment for the recharge transaction 
the card transaction is processed and settled to us in the same fashion as a typical atm transaction 
we then send a signal to the mobile operator requesting credit to the customer s account in the amount of the transaction 
the credit takes place automatically  and the customer receives a message confirming the transaction 
our mobile recharge transaction follow the same pattern  but the transaction occurs with screens directly on the mobile phone 
these recharge transactions are similar to top up transactions in our new prepaid processing segment  but since they are transmitted from our atms or mobile phone handsets and proceed through our atm operations center and managed by our atm operations group  they will continue to be reported in the eft processing segment 
our agreements with mobile operators for the atm recharge business vary in term from one to five years 
they provide for the maintenance of the electronic connection necessary to provide recharge transactions to customers and define operational and commercial terms regarding the method by which we will provide that transaction atm and mobile phone  settlement and the liability for transactions processed 
we have expanded our outsourced management solutions beyond atms to include card management and additional services  such as pos terminal management  bill payment and prepaid mobile operator solutions 
we support these services using our proprietary software products 
since  we have been selling advertising on our network 
advertising clients can display their advertisements on the video screens of our atms  on the receipts issued by the atms and on coupons dispensed with cash from the atms 

table of contents eft processing segment strategy we believe banks in both the developing and developed markets are becoming more receptive to outsourcing the operation of their atms and pos networks 
the operation of these devices requires expensive hardware and software and specialized personnel 
we have these resources available and offer them to banks under outsourcing contracts 
the expansion and enhancement of our outsourced management solutions  both in existing markets and new markets  will remain an important business strategy for euronet 
we believe increasing the number of bank owned atms that we operate under management agreements will provide continued growth while minimizing the capital we place at risk 
we continually strive to make our own atm networks more efficient by eliminating the underperforming atms and installing atms in more desirable locations 
this atm and mobile recharge line of services has been substantially strengthened through complementary services obtained by our acquisitions of e pay  transact  aim and precept 
we can now provide top up services through pos terminals 
we intend to expand our technology and business methods into other markets where we operate and hope to leverage our relationships with mobile phone companies and banks in those markets to cross sell and to facilitate that expansion 
seasonality our experience is that the level of transactions on our networks is subject to seasonal variation 
transactions per atm tend to drop in the first quarter  as compared to the preceding fourth quarter  to the lowest levels we experience during the year  primarily due to a drop in post holiday travel and spending 
since revenues of the eft processing segment are more weighted toward transactions  this segment is directly affected by this seasonality 
in years prior to  we believe our aggressive rollout of atms lessened the impact of seasonal variations on our overall transaction levels and revenues  as transactions from new atms compensated for the reduction in overall transaction levels 
segment significant customers and government contracts no individual customer makes up greater than of the consolidated total revenue in the eft processing segment 
we do not have any government contracts in this segment 
eft processing segment competition our principal eft processing competitors include atm networks owned by banks and national switches consisting of consortiums of local banks that provide outsourcing and transaction services to banks and independent atm deployers 
large  well financed companies that operate atms offer atm network and outsourcing services also compete with us in various markets 
none of these competitors have dominant market share 
competitive factors in our eft processing segment include network availability and response time  price to both the bank and to its customers  atm location and access to other networks 
certain independent non bank owned companies provide electronic recharge on atms in markets in which we provide this service 
we are not aware of any independent companies providing electronic recharge on atms across multiple markets in which we provide this service 
in this area  we believe competition will come principally from banks providing such services on their own atms through relationships with mobile operators or from card transaction switching networks that add recharge transaction capabilities to their offerings as is the case in the uk through the link network 
prepaid processing segment prepaid processing segment overview through our prepaid processing segment  we are one of largest providers of prepaid processing  or top up  services for prepaid mobile phone airtime 
our prepaid processing segment provides electronic top up services for prepaid mobile airtime in the uk  germany  spain  poland  ireland  australia  new zealand  malaysia  indonesia and in the us the prepaid processing segment now supports top up transactions at more than  points of sale in  locations across ten countries 
we began reporting the results of this new segment in the first quarter of in february  we acquired the uk based company  e pay limited  which had offices in uk and australia 
during  we expanded our prepaid services to poland  ireland and new zealand 
in the second half of  euronet expanded the prepaid processing segment with acquisitions of aim in the us and transact in germany 
in  we further expanded this segment with the acquisition of movilcarga which owns prepaid assets from grupo meflur corporacion meflur  a prepaid company in spain  and we expanded our wholly owned subsidiary  payspot  inc  through the acquisition of the shares or assets three us based prepaid companies precept in january  eps in may  and cpi in july 

table of contents for a discussion of revenues  operating profits and total assets of the prepaid processing segment during each of the last three fiscal years  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations comparison of operating results for the years ended december   and by business segment and note business segment information to the consolidated financial statements 
the major source of revenue generated by our prepaid processing segment is commissions received from mobile operators for the processing and sale of prepaid airtime for mobile phones 
customers using mobile phones pay for their usage in two ways through postpaid accounts  where usage is billed at the end of each billing period  and through prepaid accounts  where customers pay in advance by crediting their accounts prior to usage 
although operators in the us and certain european countries have provided service principally through postpaid accounts  the trend in europe and other countries offering wireless services has shifted toward prepaid accounts 
this shift is driven  according to oftel the uk telecommunications regulator surveys  by customers belief that prepaid products better meet their needs and enable them to better control their monthly wireless expenditures 
moreover  the mobile operators in developing markets favor prepaid because they do not take the credit risk with respect to payment for airtime usage 
in certain developing markets  the majority of mobile phones are prepaid 
currently  two principal methods are available to credit prepaid accounts referred to as top up of accounts 
the first is through the purchase of scratch cards bearing a pin personal identification number that  when entered into a customer s mobile phone account  credit the account by the value of airtime purchased 
scratch cards are sold predominantly through retail outlets 
the second is through various electronic means of crediting accounts using pos terminals 
electronic top up or e top up methods have several advantages over scratch cards  primarily because electronic methods do not require the cost of creation  distribution and management of a physical inventory of cards or involve the risk of losses stemming from fraud and theft 
prior to  scratch cards were the predominant method of crediting mobile phone accounts in most developed markets 
however  a shift has occurred in these markets away from usage of scratch cards to more efficient e top up methods 
in the uk  for example  we estimate that in early approximately of all top ups were performed through e top ups and through scratch cards 
by december  we estimate that as much as of all uk top ups were performed through e top ups and only through scratch cards 
our prepaid processing segment processes the distribution of prepaid mobile phone minutes to consumers through networks of pos terminals and direct connections to the electronic payment systems of retailers 
in some markets  we enter into agreements with mobile phone operators and connect directly to their back office systems 
in other markets such as germany  poland and the us  we distribute mobile phone time by connecting directly to the mobile operators or by purchasing pins that enable airtime top up from third party sources who have negotiated with the mobile operator 
we then distribute the mobile phone time electronically through pos terminals  either via a direct credit from the mobile operator to the mobile phone  or via the sales of pins 
the business has grown rapidly over the past year as new retailers have been added and prepaid airtime has switched from scratch cards to distribution by electronic means 
in our prepaid markets  we expand our distribution networks through the signing of new contracts with retailers  and in some markets through acquisition of existing networks 
we also seek to improve our results of our existing networks through the addition of new mobile operators in markets where we do not already distribute all of the available prepaid time 
in addition  in the us we are expanding our sales presence in all sales segments 
we are continuing to focus on our growing network of distributors  generally referred to as independent sales organizations isos  that are paid a commission for delivering us contracts with retailers in their network to distribute pins from their terminals 
given the role of the isos we typically classify this as indirect sales 
in addition to indirect sales  we are increasing our focus on direct relationships with independent convenient store retailers and chains  where we can negotiate direct agreements with the merchant on a multiyear basis 
to distribute pins  we establish an electronic connection with the pos terminals and maintain systems that monitor transaction levels at each terminal 
as sales to customers of mobile phone time are completed  the customer pays the retailer and the retailer becomes obligated to make settlement to us of the principal amount of the phone time sold 
at e pay  these amounts are deposited in accounts that are held in trust for the mobile operators 
in germany and the us  retailer accounts are directly debited on a contractually defined basis 
no trust arrangements currently are required in germany or the us with respect to amounts settled to us 
we maintain systems that permit us to monitor the payment practices of each retailer 
prepaid processing products and services prepaid mobile airtime transaction processing we process prepaid mobile airtime top up transactions for two types of clients  distributors and retailers  across the ten countries where we currently process pos transactions through retail shops 
both types of client transactions start with a consumer in a 
table of contents merchant shop 
the consumer uses a specially programmed pos terminal in the shop or the retailer s electronic cash register system that is connected to our network 
the customer will select a predefined amount of prepaid airtime from the carrier of his choice  and the retailer enters the selection into the pos terminal 
the consumer will pay that amount to the retailer in cash or other payment methods accepted by the retailer 
the pos device then transmits the selected transaction to our data center 
using the electronic connection we maintain with the mobile operator or drawing from an inventory of pins  the purchased amount of airtime will be either credited directly to the account of the consumer s account or delivered via pin printed by the terminal and given to the customer 
in the case of pins printed by the terminal  the customer must then call a mobile operator s toll free number to activate the purchased airtime to this customer s mobile account 
one difference in our relationships with various retailers and distributors is in how we charge for our services 
for distributors and certain very large retailers  we charge a processing fee 
however  the majority of our transactions occur with smaller retailer clients 
with these clients  we receive a commission on each transaction that is withheld from the payments made to the mobile operator  and we share that commission with the retailers 
we monitor the number of transactions made on our prepaid network 
total transactions processed by the prepaid processing segment in were million  a increase over the million transactions processed during this transaction count includes transactions from precept starting in january  from eps starting in may  from cpi starting in july  and from movilcarga starting in november as of december  the prepaid processing segment processed approximately million electronic prepaid transactions per month at more than  pos terminals across more than  retailer locations in the us  europe and asia pacific 
retailer and distributor contracts we provide our prepaid services over networks installed in retail outlets or  in the case of major retailers  through direct connections to their electronic cash register systems 
the pos terminals or the register systems are connected to our processing centers 
in markets where we operate e pay technology the uk  australia  poland  ireland  new zealand  spain and the us  we own and maintain the pos terminals 
in germany  the terminals are sold to the retailers or to distributors who service the retailer 
in all cases  we have contracts with the retailers 
our agreements with major retailers for the pos business typically have two or three year terms 
these agreements include terms regarding the connection of our networks to the respective retailer s registers or payment terminals or the maintenance of pos terminals  and obligations concerning settlement and liability for transactions processed 
generally  our agreements with individual or small retailers have shorter terms and provide that either party can terminate the agreement upon six months notice 
in germany  distributors have historically controlled the sale of mobile phone scratch cards  and they now are key intermediaries in the sale of e top up 
our business in germany is substantially concentrated in and dependent upon relationships with our major distributors 
the termination of any of our agreements with major distributors could materially and adversely affect our business in germany 
however  we are engaged in the process of establishing agreements with independent retailers in order to diversify our exposure to such distributors 
other products and services our pos network can be used for the distribution of other products and services 
although prepaid mobile airtime is the primary product distributed through our prepaid processing segment  additional products include prepaid long distance calling card plans  prepaid internet plans and prepaid mobile content  such as ring tones and games 
in certain locations  the terminals used for prepaid services can also be used for electronic funds transfer eft to process credit and debit card payments for retail merchandise 
prepaid processing segment strategy we plan to expand our prepaid mobile phone top up business in our existing markets and new markets by taking advantage of our existing relationships with mobile phone operators and retailers 
although all of these markets present market opportunities for expanding the sales of our services  we believe opportunities for transaction growth in the prepaid processing segment are greater in poland  germany and the us  where there is significant organic growth in the prepaid markets or a shift is occurring from scratch cards to electronic top up 
we also anticipate potential transaction growth opportunities in spain through the addition of certain mobile operator agreements 
seasonality our experience is that the level of transactions on our networks is subject to seasonal variation 
transaction levels tend to drop in the first quarter  as compared to the preceding fourth quarter  to the lowest levels we experience during the year  primarily due to a drop in post holiday travel and spending 
since revenues of the prepaid processing segment are primarily transaction based  this segment is directly affected by this seasonality 
we believe that the rapid growth in total pos terminals and transaction volume has lessened the impact of seasonal variations on our overall transaction levels and revenues  as transactions from new pos terminals compensated for the reduction in overall transaction levels 
significant customers and government contracts no individual customer makes up greater than of the consolidated total revenue of the prepaid processing segment 
this segment does not have any government contracts in any country 

table of contents prepaid processing segment competition we face competition in the prepaid business in all of our markets 
a few multinational companies operate in several of our markets  and we  therefore  compete with them in a number of countries 
in other markets  our competition is from smaller  local companies 
none of these companies is dominant in any of the markets where we do business 
we have approximately of the pos top up market in the uk  in germany and in australia 
in addition  we offer complementary atm and mobile recharge solutions through our eft processing centers 
the principal competitive factors in this area include price that is  the level of commission charged for each recharge transaction and up time offered on the system 
major retailers with high volumes are in a position to demand a larger share of the commission  which increases the amount of competition among service providers 
software solutions segment software solutions segment overview through our software solutions segment  we offer an integrated suite of card and retail transaction delivery applications for the ibm iseries platform and some applications on nt server environments 
these applications are generally referred to as euronet software 
the core system of this product  called integrated transaction management itm  provides for transaction identification  transaction routing  security  transaction detail logging  network connections  authorization interfaces and settlement 
front end systems in this product support atm and pos management  telephone banking  internet banking  mobile banking and event messaging 
these systems provide a comprehensive solution for atm  debit or credit card management and bill payment facilities 
we also offer increased functionality to authorize  switch and settle transactions for multiple banks through our goldnet module 
we use goldnet for our own eft requirements  processing transactions across multiple european countries and in india 
although our software solutions segment is headquartered in the us  the majority of our software customers is international and  in particular  located in developing markets 
this international customer mix is largely because our software products  based on the integrated transaction management itm core system  consist of relatively small and inexpensive packages that are appropriate for smaller banks with up to billion in assets and various transaction processing needs 
euronet software is the preferred transaction processing software for banks that operate their back office using the ibm iseries platform  which is also a relatively inexpensive  expandable hardware platform 
we believe demand will continue for our software from banks in many markets and throughout the developing world as new banks are established 
once a customer purchases our software and installs the core system  we provide a series of modules  upgrades and maintenance services that often result in recurring revenues 
our customer services support follow the sun initiatives  which represent the company s commitment to providing same time zone support for our customers worldwide 
we have three centers covering emea  the americas and asia pacific 
this coverage presents several benefits to our customers  including immediate access to live technical support  infrastructure expansion to aid in faster problem resolution and a more in depth knowledge and allowance for the uniqueness of conducting business in the various regions

software solutions segment strategy software products are an integral part of our product lines  and our investment in research  development  delivery and customer support reflects our ongoing commitment to an expanded customer base 
we have found significant opportunities for cross selling processing services to our software solutions customers and that our ability to develop  adapt and control our own software gives us credibility with our processing services customers 
we have been able to enter into agreements under which we use our software in lieu of cash as our initial capital contributions to new transaction processing joint ventures 
such contribution permits us to enter new markets without significant cash outlay 
therefore  although revenues from our software solutions segment are not currently growing significantly  we view it as a valuable element of our overall business strategy 
our software is used by our budapest and india processing centers in our eft processing segment  resulting in cost savings and added value compared to third party license and maintenance options 
our strategy in the software solutions segment in included improvement of the application functionality for our core debit and credit solutions  internet and telephone banking 
our software was upgraded to become compliant with certain new mandates of the international card organizations  involving initiatives such as emv europay  mastercard and visa chip card support and triple des data encryption standard support 
emv standards define the technology required for issuance and acceptance of chip cards 
triple des security standards represent a significant strengthening of encryption requirements to further protect sensitive data that is transmitted in transactions 
the three major card associations have jointly developed these emerging industry standards  and we 
table of contents believe they will have a significant influence over eft related hardware and software decisions throughout the next five years 
our ability to support mandated initiatives such as emv and triple des has provided significant opportunities to sell updated software to our existing customers and may enable euronet to replace competitors non compliant solutions 
in the last four years  we also undertook a strategy of signing customers to extended long term software maintenance agreements 
we continue to invest in emerging markets and technologies that complement our processing and software solutions 
seasonality the software solutions segment is not materially affected by seasonality 
significant customers and government contracts no individual consumer makes up greater than of the consolidated total revenue of the software solutions segment 
this segment does not have any government contracts with any country 
backlog we define software sales backlog as fees specified in contracts  which have been executed by us and for which we expect recognition of the related revenue within one year 
at december   the revenue backlog was million  as compared to december   when the revenue backlog was million and at december   when the revenue backlog was million 
the average backlog for was million  and for was million 
we intend to continue to focus on expediting the delivery and implementation of software in an effort to deliver existing backlog sales  while simultaneously replenishing the backlog through continuing product sales growth 
software solutions segment competition we are the leading supplier of electronic financial transaction processing software for the ibm iseries formerly as platform in a largely fragmented market  which is made up of competitors that offer a variety of solutions that compete with our products  ranging from single applications to fully integrated electronic financial processing software 
other industry suppliers service the software requirements of large mainframe systems and unix based platforms  and accordingly are not considered competitors 
we have specific target customers consisting of financial institutions that operate their back office systems with the ibm iseries 
the software solutions segment has several types of competitors 
competitors of the software solutions segment compete across all eft software components in the following areas i atm  network and pos software systems  ii internet banking software systems  iii credit card software systems  iv mobile banking systems  v mobile operator solutions  vi telephone banking  and vii full eft software 
competitive factors in the software solutions business include price  technology development and the ability of software systems to interact with other leading products 
research and development we have made an ongoing commitment to the development  maintenance and enhancement of our products and services 
we regularly engage in research and development activities in each of our business segments aimed at the development and delivery of new products  services and processes to our customers  including bill payment and presentment  telephone and internet banking products  applications for mobile devices and wireless banking software products 
we are also making significant improvements to our core software products 
our research and development costs for software products to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed totaled million in  million for and million for of these amounts  as of december   million was capitalized and is included on our consolidated balance sheet in other long term assets  net of accumulated amortization of million 
these costs were capitalized under our accounting policy requiring the capitalization of development costs on a product by product basis once technological feasibility is established through the completion of a detailed program design or the creation of a working model of the product 
technological feasibility of computer software products is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
see note research and development to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed summary of the prior three years research and development capitalized costs and related amortization expense 

table of contents financial information by geographic area for a discussion of revenues  property  plant equipment  and total assets by geographic location  please see note business segment information to the consolidated financial statements 
employees our business is highly automated and we outsource many of its specialized  repetitive functions such as atm maintenance and installation  cash delivery and security 
as a result  our labor requirements for ongoing operation of our eft and prepaid networks are relatively modest and are centered on monitoring activities to ensure service quality and cash reconciliation and control 
we also have customer service departments in all divisions to interface  investigate and resolve reported problems in processing transactions 
we have technical service departments to implement connections with banks and mobile operators and adapt pos terminals to our central processing centers 
we had and employees as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   the number of employees has increased to  due to acquisitions and additional administrative and implementation staff to address our large contracts 
we believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to recruit  retain and motivate qualified management  technical and administrative employees 
currently  no union represents any of our employees 
we have never experienced any work stoppages or strikes by our workforce 
government regulation our business activities do not constitute financial activities subject to licensing in any of our current markets 
any expansion of our activity into areas that are qualified as financial activity under local legislation may subject us to licensing and we may be required to comply with various conditions to obtain such licenses 
moreover  the interpretations of bank regulatory authorities as to the activity we currently conduct might change in the future 
we monitor our business for compliance with applicable laws or regulations regarding financial activities 
under german law  only licensed financial institutions may operate atms in germany 
therefore  we may not operate our own atm network in germany 
in that market  we act only as a subcontractor providing certain atm related services to a sponsor bank 
as a result  our activities in the german market currently are entirely dependent upon the continuance of our agreement with our sponsor bank  or the ability to enter into a similar agreement with another bank in the event of the termination of such agreement 
in january  we entered into a new sponsorship agreement with bankhaus august lenz bal canceling an agreement with diba bank  our previous sponsor bank 
we believe  based on our experience  we should be able to find a replacement for bal if the agreement with bal is terminated for any reason 
the inability to maintain the bal agreement or to enter into a similar agreement with another bank upon a termination of the bal agreement could have a material adverse effect on our operations in germany 
intellectual property we have registered or applied for registration of our trademarks including the names euronet and bankomat and or the blue diamond logo in most markets in which we use those trademarks 
certain trademark authorities have notified us that they consider the trademarks euronet and bankomat to be generic and therefore not protected by trademark laws 
this determination does not affect our ability to use the euronet trademark in those markets but it would prevent us from stopping other parties from using it in competition with euronet 
we have purchased a registration of the euronet trademark in the class of atm machines in germany  the uk and certain other western european countries 
we have registered the e pay logo trademark in the uk  australia  and malaysia and will be extending such registration as we expand that business to new markets 
we cannot be sure that we will be entitled to use the e pay trademark in any markets other than those in which we have registered the trademark 
other trademarks euronet has registered or has registrations pending in various countries include integrated transaction management  itm  payspot  arksys  cashnet  bank and bank access during and  we filed patent applications for a number of our new software products and our new processing technology  including our recharge services and a browser based atm operating system 
in  we filed a patent application with the us patent office for our pos recharge products in support of e pay and payspot technology 
as of the date of this report  these patents are still pending 
technology in the areas in which we operate is developing very rapidly and we are aware that many other companies have filed patent applications for similar products 
the procedures of the us patent office make it impossible for us to predict whether our patent applications will be approved or will be granted priority dates that are earlier than other patents that have been filed for similar products or services 
if other applicants are granted priority dates that are earlier than ours  and if their patents are considered to cover technology that has been incorporated into our systems  we may be required to obtain licenses and pay royalties to the holders of such patents to continue to use the affected technology or be prohibited from continuing the offering of such services if licenses are not obtained 
this could materially and adversely affect our business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview euronet worldwide is an electronic transaction processor  offering atm and pos outsourcing services  integrated electronic financial transaction eft software  network gateways  and electronic prepaid top up services to financial institutions  mobile operators and retailers 
we operate the largest independent pan european atm network and the largest national shared atm network in india  and are one of the largest providers of prepaid processing  or top up services  for prepaid mobile airtime 
we have processing centers in the us  europe and asia  and process electronic top up transactions at more than  point of sale pos terminals across approximately  locations in the us  europe and asia pacific 
euronet s corporate headquarters are in leawood  kansas  usa  and it has offices worldwide  serving clients in more than countries 
economic factors  industry factors and risks our company faces certain economic and industry wide factors that could materially affect our business 
we are an international company  and face economic  political  technology infrastructure and legal issues in every country in which we operate could have a positive or negative impact  and therefore are considered risks 
some of the more significant factors that our management is focused on include the following technological and business developments in the local card  electronic and mobile banking and mobile phone markets affecting transaction and other fees that we are able to charge for our services foreign exchange fluctuations competition from bank owned atm networks  providers of atm outsourcing services  providers of prepaid mobile phone services and software providers our relationships with our major customers  sponsor banks in various markets  international card organizations and mobile operators  including the risk of contract terminations with major customers  retailers or mobile operators changes in laws and regulations affecting our business lines of business  geographic locations and principal products and services we operate in three principal business segments eft processing segment  in which we process transactions for a network of  atms and  pos terminals across europe  the middle east  africa and india 
we provide comprehensive electronic payment solutions consisting of atm network participation  outsourced atm and pos management solutions  and electronic recharge services for prepaid mobile airtime 
prepaid processing segment  through which we provide prepaid processing  or top up services  for prepaid mobile airtime and other prepaid products 
we operate a network of more than  pos terminals providing electronic processing of prepaid mobile phone airtime top up services in the us  europe and asia pacific 
software solutions segment  through which we offer a suite of integratedeft software solutions for electronic payment and transaction delivery systems 
as of december   we had principal offices in europe  four in the asia pacific region  two in the us and one in egypt 
the company s executive offices are located in leawood  kansas  usa sources of revenues and cash flow euronet earns revenues and income based on atm management fees  transaction fees  professional services  software licensing fees and software maintenance agreements 
each business segment s sources revenue are described below 
eft processing segment of total segment revenue  for the year ended december  approximately was derived from atms we owned excluding those leased by us in connection with outsourcing agreements 
we believe our shift from a largely proprietary  euronet owned atm network to a greater focus on atms operated under outsourcing agreements will provide higher marginal returns on investments 
on our proprietary network  we generally charge fees for four types of atm transactions that are processed on our atms cash withdrawals 
table of contents balance inquiries transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization prepaid telecommunication recharges we include in eft processing segment revenues transaction based fees payable for mobile pone recharge time that we distribute through our atms 
fees for recharge transactions vary significantly from market to market and are based on the specific prepaid solution and the denomination of prepaid usage purchased 
any or all of these fees may come under pricing pressure in the future 
customer owned atms operated under outsource service agreements require a nominal up front capital investment because we do not purchase the atms 
we typically  but not in all cases  charge a per atm management fee and a transaction fee for each atm managed under our outsourcing agreements 
additionally  in many instances operating costs are the responsibility of the owner and  therefore  recurring operating expenses per atm are lower 
prepaid processing segment the significant growth in the revenue and operating income in our prepaid processing segment is the result of the acquisitions of precept  eps  cpi and movilcarga together with the significant growth rates experienced at each of these businesses 
during  e pay established contractual relationships with many large retailers to distribute mobile top up services through pos terminals  which were all implemented by the beginning of  resulting in significant transaction growth throughout the year 
while the company has benefited from acquired streams of revenue  approximately of the prepaid processing segment s revenue growth over was from the acquired entities growth subsequent to the date of acquisition 
we do not expect these growth rate levels to continue 
revenue is recognized based on commissions or processing fees received from mobile and other telecommunication operators or from distributors of prepaid wireless products for the distribution and or processing of prepaid mobile airtime and other telecommunication products 
due to certain provisions in our mobile phone operator agreements  the operators have the ability to reduce the overall commission paid on each top up transaction 
however  by virtue of the company s contracts with retailers in certain markets  not all of these reductions are absorbed by euronet 
in those markets  when mobile phone operators reduce overall commissions  the effect is to reduce revenues and reduce our direct operating costs resulting in only a small impact  if any  on gross margin and operating income 
in australia  certain retailers negotiate directly with the mobile phone operators for their own commission rates 
our maintenance of agreements with mobile operators is important to the success of our business  because these agreements permit us to distribute top up to the mobile operators customers 
the loss of any agreements with mobile operators in any market could materially and adversely affect our results 
growth in our prepaid business in any given market is driven by a number of factors  including the extent to which conversion from scratch cards to electronic distribution solutions is occurring or has been completed  the overall pace of growth in the prepaid mobile telephone market  the company s market share of the retail distribution capacity and the level of commission that is paid to the various intermediaries in prepaid mobile airtime distribution chain 
in mature markets  such as the u 
k  australia and ireland  the conversion from scratch cards to electronic forms of distribution is either complete or nearing completion  therefore  this factor will cease to provide the historic organic increases in the number of transactions per terminal 
also in mature markets  competition among prepaid distributors results in the reduction of commissions and margins by mobile operators as well as retailer churn 
in other markets in which we operate  such as poland  germany and the us  many of the factors that may contribute to rapid growth conversion from scratch cards to electronic distribution  growth in the prepaid market and rapid roll out of our network of retailers remain present 
software solutions segment the revenues from the software solutions segment are derived from software license fees  professional service fees for providing customization  installation and consulting services to customers  ongoing software maintenance fees and hardware sales 
opportunities  challenges and risks our expansion plans and opportunities are focused on three primary areas i outsourced atm management contracts  ii our prepaid mobile phone airtime top up processing services  and iii transactions processed on our network of owned and operated atms 
the continued expansion and development of our atm business will depend on various factors including the following the demand for our atm outsourcing services in our current target markets  the ability to develop products or services to drive increases in transactions  the expansion of our various business lines in countries where we operate  entering into additional card acceptance and atm management agreements with banks  
table of contents the availability of financing for expansion  and the ability to effectively and efficiently convert atms contracted under newly awarded outsourcing agreements 
we carefully monitor the revenue and transactional growth of our atm networks in each of our markets  and we adjust our plans depending on local market conditions  such as variations in the transaction fees we receive  competition  overall trends in atm transaction levels and performance of individual atms 
we consistently evaluate and add prospects to our list of potential atm outsource customers 
however  we cannot predict the increase or decrease in the number of atms we manage under outsourcing agreements  because this depends largely on the willingness of banks to enter into outsourcing contracts with us 
due to the thorough internal reviews and extensive negotiations conducted by existing and prospective banking customers in choosing outsource vendors  the process of entering into or renewing outsourcing agreements can take approximately nine months to more than one year 
the process is further complicated by the legal and regulatory considerations of local countries as well as language differences 
these agreements tend to cover large numbers of atms  so significant increases and decreases in our pool of managed atms could result from signature or termination of these management contracts 
therefore  the timing of both current and new contract revenues is uncertain and unpredictable 
we plan to expand our prepaid mobile phone top up business  which is currently focused on the uk  germany  the uk  ireland  poland  new zealand  spain and australia  into our other markets by taking advantage of our expertise together with existing relationships with mobile phone operators and retailers 
this expansion will depend on various factors  including the following the ability to negotiate new agreements for other markets with mobile phone operators and retailers  the continuation of the trend of conversion from scratch card solutions to electronic processing solutions for prepaid airtime among mobile phone users and the continued use of third party providers such as ourselves to supply this service  the development of mobile phone networks in these markets and the increase in the number of mobile phone users  the availability of financing for expansion 
in addition  our continued expansion may involve acquisitions that could divert our resources and management time and require integration of new assets with our existing networks and services 
our ability to effectively manage our rapid expansion will require us to expand our operating systems and employee base in  particularly at the management level  which may reduce our operating income 
an inability to do this could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
inadequate technology and resources would impair our ability to maintain current processing technology and efficiencies as well as deliver new and innovative services to compete in the marketplace 
summary of annual results the following description of our operating results compares the fiscal year ended december  with prior periods

business segment information summary as of december   we operated in three principal business segments the eft processing segment  which includes our proprietary atm network and outsourced management of atms for banks or financial institutions and includes various new processing services that we provide for these entities and mobile phone companies through our network of owned and managed atms  such as mobile phone recharge services at the atms 
the prepaid processing segment  consisting of e pay  transact  payspot and movilcarga  which provides electronic top up transaction services at retail stores for mobile and other telecommunication operators through pos terminals 
the software solutions segment  which provides transaction processing software solutions to banks that enable them to operate atms and pos terminals and processes financial transactions from those devices  telephones  mobile devices and the internet

table of contents comparison of operating results for the years ended december   and by business segment eft processing segment compared to the following table summarizes the results of operations for the eft processing segment for the years ended december  and results for the year ended december  year over year change dollar amounts in thousands increase decrease amount increase decrease percent total revenues operating expense direct operating cost salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income transactions processed millions atms as of december average atms revenues revenues for increased over as a result of the increase in number of atms operated and the number of transactions processed compared to  as a result of atm management agreements in poland  romania and india 
revenue per average atm was  in  compared to  in  or a decrease 
revenue per transaction decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  generally  these decreases are the result of a continued shift from euronet proprietarily owned atms to atms managed under outsourcing agreements 
under outsourcing agreements  the company primarily earns revenue based on a fixed recurring monthly management fee  with less dependence on transactions because incremental transactions have little impact on the fixed or variable costs of managing atms 
the more significant decrease in revenue per transaction is due to an overall increase in the number of transactions on atms that are managed under outsourcing agreements 
since revenue from these arrangements is derived primarily from a fixed monthly management fee  an increase in the number of transactions processed does not generate commensurate increases in related revenue 
as of december   the company owned of the atms operated excluding those leased by us in connection with outsourcing agreements and operated the remaining under management outsourcing agreements  compared to and  respectively  as of december  of total segment revenue  approximately was from atms we owned excluding those leased by us in connection with outsourcing agreements for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  we believe our shift from a largely proprietary  euronet owned atm network to operating atms under outsourcing arrangements is a positive development in the long run and will provide higher marginal returns on investment 
customer owned atms operated under service agreements require a nominal up front capital investment because we do not purchase the atms  nor do we incur the start up costs typically incurred in the early life cycle of euronet owned atm 
additionally  in many instances operating costs are the responsibility of the owner and  therefore  recurring operating expenses per atm are lower 
operating expenses total segment operating expenses increased from to  primarily due to the increase in the number of atms under operation 
however  as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses decreased to of revenues in from in  
table of contents reflecting improved leverage  efficiency and scalability 
the increase in atms operated under outsourcing arrangements with lower operating costs compared to company owned atms also contributed to the expense decrease in relation to revenues 
direct operating costs consist primarily of site rental fees  cash delivery costs  cash supply costs  maintenance  insurance  telecommunications and the cost of data center operations related personnel  as well as the processing center s facility related costs and other processing center related expenses 
as discussed in note basis of preparation  to the consolidated financial statements  euronet changed the manner in which it reports eft processing segment direct costs  salaries and benefits and sales  general and administrative sg a expenses 
in prior periods  processing center costs were charged to and then allocated from sg a to direct costs on the basis of a standard rate per transaction 
we have evaluated this approach and believe that the specific assignment of processing center salaries and related costs together with other costs directly attributable to the center is a preferred method and more appropriately reflects the variable and non variable nature of our operating expenses 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
this change does not impact consolidated operating income or net income for any period presented 
direct operating costs increased to of revenue for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  direct operating costs per atm were  and  for and  respectively 
the increase for is attributed to a gain of million recorded as an offset to direct operating expenses during for the sale of hungarian atms 
direct operating costs per transaction have decreased to per transaction during from per transaction during the improvement in direct operating costs per transaction was the result of increasing transaction volumes at existing sites  without commensurate increases in direct operating costs  costs associated with these sites increase at a slower rate  or not at all  compared to transaction volumes 
additional improvements resulted from installing outsourced atms whose direct costs per atm and on an average per transaction basis were lower than the existing installed base of atms 
as discussed under revenues above  the number of atms that we operate under atm management outsourcing agreements has increased as compared to atms that we own and operate 
outsourced atms generally have lower direct operating expenses telecommunications  cash delivery  security  maintenance and site rental because  depending on the customer  the customer retains the responsibility for certain operational costs 
gross margin per atm  which is revenue less direct operating costs  was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margin per transaction was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreases in gross margin per atm and gross margin per transaction is the result of a non recurring million gain on the sale of hungarian atms in recognized as a reduction in direct operating costs and as a result of a significant increase in transactions related to atms managed under outsourcing agreements where the average number of transactions per atm was significantly higher than the average transactions per atm of the existing installed base 
salaries and benefits increased by  and selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  during compared to due to euronet s growing business in asian markets  staffing for the outsourcing agreement in romania and certain incentive compensation payments earned based on meeting or exceeding performance plans and general merit increases awarded to employees 
certain staffing increases were also necessary due to the larger number of atms under operation and transactions processed 
these expenses as a percentage of revenue  however  continued to trend downward during decreasing to a total of for compared to for this decrease as a percentage of revenue reflects the leverage and scalability associated with increases in revenue without commensurate increases in salaries and benefits and selling  general and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased compared to this increase is due to additional depreciation on more than atms under capital lease arrangements related to an outsourcing agreement in poland implemented in the first half of  additional processing center computer equipment necessary to handle increased transaction volumes and technology upgrades to certain of our owned atms during management expects that depreciation levels in the future will grow at slower rates as more atms reach the end of their depreciable lives and atms are not replaced  and we continue to move towards increasing the number of atms that we operate under atm management agreements rather than as owner operators 
operating income operating income for increased over and operating margin as a percentage of revenue increased to during from for operating income per transaction was during  the same as and operating income per atm increased to  in from  in the continuing increases in operating income as a percentage of revenue and per atm was due to significant growth in revenues and transactions without commensurate increases in operating expenses  as well as the continuing migration toward operating atms under management outsourcing agreements rather that ownership arrangements 
in addition  in our eft operations in india began managing a number of atms under outsourcing agreements sufficient to produce positive operating results in the latter part of asia pacific operating losses were reduced from million in to million in management expects to produce operating income in this market during

we now operate the atms in that network under a five year outsourcing agreement 
with the sale  all employees of our uk subsidiary were transferred to the buyer 
the results of operations for the uk atm network continue to be included in continuing operations due to the ongoing revenues generated by the outsourcing agreement 
in order to provide a more meaningful comparison of the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december   we have provided the pro forma schedule above that adjusts the revenues and expenses to exclude the uk atm network business and include the benefits of the outsourcing agreement as if it were in effect for the year 
this presentation is consistent with our presentation in the form k filing we made on january  relating to the sale of the uk atm network 
revenues total segment revenues for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  primarily due to the sale of the uk atm network 
on a pro forma basis  if uk atm network revenues are excluded and the related outsourcing revenues are included in the comparative amounts due to the sale of the uk atm network  revenues increased for the year ended december  over the year ended december  pro forma revenues 
transaction growth in the eft processing segment for the year as compared to was 
this is greater than both the increase in atms operated and revenue growth due to an increase in atms operated under management outsourcing agreements relative to company owned atms during these periods 
as of december   we owned of these atms excluding those leased by us in connection with outsourcing agreements and operated the remaining under management outsourcing agreements  compared to and  respectively  as of december  revenues generated from atm management agreements often have a substantial monthly fee  as compared to a per transaction fee for company owned atms 
this recurring fee comprises both fixed and variable revenue components 
as a result  transactions on these machines generally increase faster than revenues 
substantially all of the increase in the number of atms from to was from atm management agreements in central europe

in the czech republic  beginning in november  a single intra regional interchange fee for atm cash withdrawals was agreed to by czech issuer banks for both visa and europay cards 
for visa cards  the fee is and for europay cards the fee is 
prior to these changes  the company was averaging fees of approximately per cash withdrawal in the czech republic 
this intra regional interchange fee had the effect of reducing revenues for our deployed machines in the czech republic by approximately million in additionally  the transactions per atm in the czech republic trended downward during by approximately from the first as compared to the fourth quarters  partially due to the increase in the interchange fee in late as well as certain competitive and other economic conditions 
in  transactions per atm consistently trended above those of and more than offset the revenue decline in operating expenses for the year ended december   total segment operating expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease was the sale and resulting elimination of the uk atm network expenses in january however  as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses decreased to of revenues in from of revenues in  reflecting the improved leverage  efficiency and scalability of the atm management operations 
on a pro forma basis  operating expenses increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses is primarily the result of additional expense to support the increase in transactions and increase in average atms for the year 
additionally  salaries increased as a result of resources necessary to support our operational growth during the period  the achievement of certain incentive awards and market development costs in asia 
incentive compensation awards for were approximately million in excess of those achieved in operating expenses in asia were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  direct operating costs decreased to of revenue for the year ended december  from on a pro forma basis for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the increased number of atms combined with an increase in the number of transactions on existing sites that have fixed direct operating expenses due to the move toward outsourcing from ownership 
additionally  during the company recorded a gain of million as an offset to direct operating expenses related to the sale of hungarian atms 
direct costs per transaction have decreased to per transaction in from per transaction on a pro forma basis for because of increasing transaction volumes at existing sites  without commensurate increases in direct operating costs 
costs associated with these sites increase at a slower rate  or not at all  compared to transaction volumes 
in addition  the number of atms that we operate under atm management outsource agreements has increased as compared to atms that we own and operate 
outsourced atms generally have lower direct operating expenses telecommunications  cash delivery  security  maintenance and site rental because  depending on the customer  the customer retains certain operational cost responsibilities 
gross margin  which represents revenue less direct operating costs  per atm was  for and  for on a pro forma basis and gross margin per transaction was and  respectively 
increases in gross margin per atm are due to higher growth in transactions and revenues without commensurate increases in direct operating costs 
certain direct operating expenses such as maintenance  cash fill and supply and telecommunication costs are minimized or eliminated as we migrate toward atm management outsource agreements and away from atm ownership arrangements requiring the company  as the owner of the atm  to bear all of these costs 
the slight trend downward in gross margin per transaction is primarily due to the increase in transactions under network sharing arrangements  certain atm management outsourcing agreements and mobile recharge transactions at high volumes and lower than average rates per transaction 
salaries and benefits for increased over pro forma results and as a percentage of segment revenue increased to during from of revenue for these increases are primarily due to an increase in staff levels in euronet s asian markets as well as certain incentive compensation related to recent contracts and bonuses for the achievement of certain performance objectives in that were not achieved in selling  general and administrative costs for increased million over pro forma primarily because of an increase in market development expenses in our asian business 
additionally  during approximately million was provided as reserve for a loss on certain atm disbursements resulting from a card association s change in their data exchange format 

table of contents operating income operating income for increased over and operating margin as a percentage of revenue increased to during from for on a pro forma basis  operating income improved by for the year ended december  over operating margin per transaction was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
finally  operating margin per atm was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these improvements are due to significant growth in revenues and transactions without commensurate increases in operating expenses  as well as the continuing migration toward operating atms under management outsourcing agreements  rather than ownership arrangements 
prepaid processing segment the prepaid processing segment was established in with the acquisition of e pay in february  followed by the acquisition of aim in september and transact in november 
during  the company continued to grow the segment through acquisitions of precept  eps  cpi and movilcarga 
these transactions are more fully described in note acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
to assist in better understanding the results of the prepaid processing segment  pro forma results have been provided as if all acquired businesses were included in our consolidated results of operations as of january  due to the rapid growth of this segment of our operations  the following discussion and analysis will focus on comparisons of both actual results for and and  as appropriate  pro forma results prepared as if all acquisitions had taken place as of january  the following table summarizes the segments results for the years ended december  and year ended december  year over year change compared to as reported dollar amounts in thousands as reported as reported increase decrease increase decrease total revenues operating expense direct operating cost salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income transactions processed millions pos count as of december 
table of contents year ended december  year over year change compared to pro forma dollar amounts in thousands pro forma unaudited pro forma unaudited increase decrease increase decrease total revenues operating expense direct operating cost salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income summary the prepaid processing segment business has grown rapidly over the past years as new retailers have been added and mobile operators have switched from scratch cards to distribution by electronic means  as well as through acquisitions 
growth in our prepaid business in any given market is driven by a number of factors 
these factors include the extent to which conversion from scratch cards to electronic distribution solutions is occurring or has been completed  the general pace of growth in the prepaid mobile airtime market  our share of retail distribution capacity  and the level of commission that is paid to various intermediaries in the prepaid mobile airtime distribution chain 
the year over year actual and pro forma results for the prepaid processing segment presented above reflect significant growth through acquisitions and growth in operations from businesses acquired during growth in existing operations was predominantly from e pay in the uk  ireland  australia  poland and new zealand  and from our operations through transact in germany and payspot in the us the us and australian mobile operators were among the first markets to aggressively promote the use of electronic top up products instead of card products  which has significantly benefited e pay 
e pay also benefited from strong sales in both and  during which time it was successful in signing e top up distribution agreements with several major uk and australian retailers 
during  the entire segment experienced the full year impact of retailer agreements signed and implemented during growth in revenue and operating income on a pro forma basis during is the result of the start up of each of our acquired prepaid businesses complemented by the conversion of mobile operators from prepaid top up using scratch card solutions to electronic top up solutions  such as those we provide 
in that we generally share with retailers the commissions we earn from the mobile operators  direct operating cost grew at rates similar to the revenue growth 
revenues revenue of the prepaid processing segment consists of commissions received from mobile and other telecommunication operators or transaction processing fees from prepaid wireless top up distributors for the distribution and or processing of prepaid mobile airtime and other telecommunication products 
due to certain provisions of our mobile phone operator agreements  mobile phone operators have the ability to reduce the overall commission paid on each top up transaction 
however  by virtue of our contracts with retailers in some markets  not all of these reductions are absorbed by euronet 
therefore  when mobile phone operators reduce overall commissions  the effect is to reduce revenues and direct costs with only a small  if any  impact on operating income 
in australia certain retailers negotiate directly with the mobile phone operators for their own commission rates 
in addition to prepaid mobile airtime  we distribute small amounts of prepaid long distance phone time in the us  us and australia  and we expect to continue to do so 
as other telecommunications and prepaid products are introduced  this mix is expected to change 
the prepaid processing segment s revenues increased and total transactions processed increased over  reflecting growth in existing operations  the impact of our acquisitions and the full year effects of our acquisitions 
on a pro forma basis  revenues increased over as a result of the addition of pos terminals throughout all of our markets  combined with mobile operators shifting from scratch card distribution to electronic distribution 
our acquisitions of precept  eps  cpi and movilcarga contributed million to revenues 
the full year impact of the acquisitions of e pay  aim and transact resulted in increased revenues of million for additionally  revenues have grown from the full year effects of retailer 
table of contents agreements implemented in  as well as the expansion of operations in new zealand  ireland and poland at various times during approximately of our revenue increase over was from the acquired entities growth subsequent to the date of acquisition resulting from contracts with many new retailers and through increased prepaid traffic over our existing terminals 
we do not expect these growth rates to continue and  in certain markets  we have noticed the competitive effects of lower pricing and margins driven by certain mobile operations and retailers 
revenue per transaction decreased to for compared to for due in large part to the full year impact of decreases in uk commissions from mobile operators during this decrease in commissions has had minimal impact on margins because of our ability to pass the reductions through to retailers 
moreover  further contributing to this decrease in average revenue per transaction was the full year inclusion of transact  which we acquired in november the majority of the transactions processed by transact earn revenues based on transaction fees from distributors  where the distributor directly contracts with the mobile operators for prepaid wireless airtime distribution and pay transact a fee to process the related transactions 
revenue growth in the mature markets of the uk and australia has flattened substantially during as conversion from scratch cards to electronic top up approaches completion 
we expect most of our growth from and beyond to derive from developing markets or markets in which there is organic growth in the prepaid sector  overall  or continued conversion from scratch cards to electronic top up 
operating expenses direct operating expenses in the prepaid processing segment include the commissions we pay to retail merchants for the distribution and sale of prepaid mobile airtime and other prepaid products  as well as communication and paper expenses required to operate pos terminals 
these expenditures vary directly with revenues and processed transactions 
direct operating expenses increased by  approximating the increase in both transactions and revenues 
direct operating expenses per transaction were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost per transaction is primarily due to two aspects of our businesses i mobile operator rate decreases in the uk  which were passed through to retailers  however  whether the mobile operators will change their commission structures  or whether any such change could be successfully passed through to retailers  cannot be projected  and ii the full year impact of the operations of transact  which was acquired during november  the majority of the transactions currently processed by transact earn revenues based on a transactional fee structure with minimal or no related direct costs 
we expect transact s proportion of the total prepaid business to continue to expand 
gross margin  which represents revenue less direct costs  grew due to increases in transactions processed  however  it remained flat as a percentage of revenue and on a per transaction basis 
gross margin was and for and  respectively  and gross margin per transaction was for both years 
although segment salaries and benefits expenses increased for as compared to  these expenses remained flat at of revenue for both years 
the salary increase year over year was the result of the inclusion of salaries of acquired entities  staffing to accommodate the transactional volume growth and annual merit increases 
sales  general and administrative expense increased during as compared to and represented and  respectively  of revenue 
this increase is due to the additional expense contributed by the acquisitions  the full year impact of the company s acquisitions and increased costs associated with the revenue growth in this segment 
the expansion of prepaid processing in us market also contributed to both the total sales  general and administrative expense and expense as a percentage of revenue 
depreciation and amortization expense  which primarily represents amortization of acquired intangibles  for was higher than for due to the full year impact of the amortization of intangible assets acquired during as well as the current year amortization of intangible assets acquired during however  depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue decreased to for from for  reflecting growth in revenues from e pay  transact and aim subsequent to their acquisition  without commensurate increases in depreciation and amortization expense 
operating income operating income for increased compared to and increased to of revenue for from of revenue for due to the significant growth in revenues and transactions processed  while slightly lowering our total operating costs as a percentage of revenue to for compared to for on a pro forma basis  operating income for increased compared to and remained relatively flat at of revenue for  compared to of revenue for 
table of contents software solutions segment a comparative summary of the statement of operations for the software solutions segment is presented below

increase decrease vs 
increase decrease dollar amounts in thousands total revenues operating expense direct operating cost salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income the software solutions segment recognizes revenue from licensing  professional services and maintenance fees for software and sales of related hardware 
software license fees are the initial fees we charge to license our proprietary application software to customers 
professional fees consist of charges for customization  installation and consulting services to customers 
software maintenance revenue represents the ongoing fees charged for maintenance and support for customers software products 
hardware sales are derived from the sale of computer equipment necessary for the respective software solution 
the components of software solutions revenue are summarized in the following table year ended december  in thousands software license fees professional service fees maintenance fees hardware sales total revenue revenues total software revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and they decreased from the year ended december  to the decline from to  and a portion of the decline from to was due to a decrease in revenue recognized from the sale of software licenses to fidelity national financial fnf  formerly alltel information systems 
revenues recognized related to this contract totaled to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the current year decrease over the prior year is generally in line with expectations 
in  we entered into several significant contracts that resulted in increased license and professional services revenue 
in  the business mix reflected a larger percentage related to professional service contracts to upgrade our clients to a standardized release level  which typically generate lower revenues 
this is consistent with the software solutions long term strategy to position our client base to take advantage of our new license offerings 
together  both software license fees and professional service fees decreased by million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  and decreased by million during from million for the year ended december  based on our projections and the focus on supporting other divisions within the company  the level of software license fee and professional fee revenues for is anticipated to remain consistent with the levels 
maintenance fees have remained relatively flat for all three years due to increased completion of software delivery components of the contracts offset by the reduction of maintenance for fnf 
since hardware sales are an incidental component to the segment s software license and professional service products  the decreases from to and from to are also related to the decrease in software license fees and professional service fees 

table of contents software sales backlog software sales backlog is defined as fees specified in contracts that have been executed and for which we expect recognition of the related revenue within one year 
our backlog was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the average backlog for was million  and for was million 
there can be no assurance that the contracts included in these backlog figures will generate revenue within the one year period 
operating expenses direct operating costs consist of hardware costs and distributor commissions 
hardware costs are incidental to our software license fee and professional service products and have decreased relative to hardware sales 
direct operating costs decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and increased for the year ended december  as compared to december  the majority of the decrease for related to reductions in distributor commissions commensurate with the decrease in sales 
we expect to continue pursuing strategic distributor relationships during salary and benefits expense decreased for the year ended december  as compared to year ended december  and decreased for the year ended december  as compared to year ended december  these decreases are the result of our cost control efforts 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in related to the renegotiation of certain telecommunication contracts  and in related to the continuing efforts to control expenses by reducing rental  insurance  banking and other administrative costs 
we capitalize software development costs on a product by product basis once technological feasibility is established 
technological feasibility is established after the completion of all planning  designing  coding and testing activities necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
we capitalized million  million and million for the years ended december   and we are continuing the development  maintenance and enhancement of our products  and total research and development costs for software products to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  including amounts capitalized  which were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
operating income the segment s total operating income increased from to and from to this overall improvement is due to the operating efficiencies and management of costs as discussed above

increase decrease vs 
increase decrease dollar amounts in thousands salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total direct operating expenses operating expenses for the corporate services segment increased by for the year ended december  from the year ended december  and from the year ended december  to the increase in is primarily attributable to professional fees for sarbanes oxley compliance and resources to support the significant growth in the business 
we estimate that we incurred approximately million in to fulfill the requirements of sarbanes oxley compliance 
these costs are expected to continue and will likely increase 
the increase for over is largely attributable to the achievement of performance 
table of contents bonuses in that were not achieved in  coupled with increased insurance costs and costs related to certain additional staffing added in the second half of non operating results interest income interest income increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase for is due to increases in cash deposits held in our trust accounts related to the administration of customer collections and vendor remittance activities of the growing prepaid processing segment  increases in average balances held in operational accounts that earn interest and a slight increase in in the average interest rate earned as compared to the increase is the result of interest earned on restricted cash with respect to the administration of customer collection and vendor remittance activities of the prepaid processing segment 
interest expense interest expense remained approximately flat for  totaling million  compared to million for although our overall debt level increased from million as of december  to million as of december  substantially all of this increase occurred near the end of the upon the december completion of the million in contingently convertible debenture offering described in note debt obligations to the consolidated financial statements 
since this transaction occurred so close to the end of the year and accrues interest at  the impact on was negligible 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase of million in interest related to the senior discount notes resulting from a weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro during as well as million of interest on indebtedness incurred for the acquisition of e pay 
this increase was substantially offset by the reduction in interest expense as a result of the full year effect of a million cash redemption of our euro denominated senior discount notes made in july as well as net reductions in capital lease obligations of million 
gain on sale of uk atm network in january  we sold of the shares in our uk subsidiary for million 
concurrently with this sale  we signed a services agreement with the buyer whereby the eft processing segment will provide atm operating  monitoring and transaction processing services to the buyer through december  as a result of this sale  we recognized a gain on the sale of million and deferred the recognition of million in revenue  which will be recognized ratably over the five year service agreement 
moreover  we recognized no tax expense on this sale as a result of the favorable treatment of such gains between the netherlands  where the parent of the uk subsidiary is incorporated  and the uk the uk s results continue to be included in continuing operations due the ongoing outsourcing revenues as well as those deferred 
loss on facility sublease we incurred a loss of million in related to the sublease of excess office space 
we subleased approximately  square feet in august to an unrelated third party under a non cancelable sublease agreement at lease rates lower than those being paid by euronet for the space 
equity in income and losses from equity unconsolidated subsidiaries euronet recorded million and million in equity in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries during and  respectively  primarily as a result of our share of net income in e pay malaysia 
the equity loss of million during resulted from the company s share of losses of cashnet egypt 
loss on early retirement of debt we recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of million during related to the redemption and repayment of the remaining million senior discount notes 
additionally  euronet recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of million in primarily due to the exercise of our rights to redeem million in partial redemption of its senior discount notes 
these transactions are further described in note debt obligations to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange loss foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities give rise to foreign exchange gains and losses as a result of us dollar to local currency exchange movements 
we recorded net foreign exchange losses of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
exchange gains and losses that result from re measurement of certain assets and liabilities are recorded in 
table of contents determining net income or loss 
a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in the euro  british pounds  and other currencies  including capital lease obligations  notes payable  cash and cash equivalents  and investments 
the significant strengthening of the euro and british pound against the us dollar is the primary source of the losses incurred during and  while the losses for resulted primarily due to fluctuations of the us dollar against the euro 
it is our intention to attempt to match local currency receivables and payables  thereby minimizing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
income tax expense tax expense on income from continuing operations was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  as compared to a tax benefit of million for tax expense for comprises of million in tax expense related to the prepaid processing segment and million in tax expense related to the eft processing segment 
the tax expense comprises million in tax expense related to the prepaid processing segment  million in tax expense related to the eft processing segment  and million in tax benefit related to corporate 
the income tax benefit for was primarily the result of utilizing us tax loss carryforwards generated in prior years to offset the taxable gain resulting from the dash sale  as well as the recognition of deferred tax benefits from foreign tax loss carryforwards anticipated to be utilized over the subsequent two years 
the increase in tax expense is due to the growing profitability of individual companies in the prepaid processing and eft processing segments  particularly in western europe and australia  together with the inclusion of e pay and transact for the full year ended december  compared to only eleven months and two months  respectively  during the year ended december  our effective tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations was compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  included a non taxable gain on the sale of the uk atm network  which resulted in a low effective tax rate 
if this gain were not included in the prior year  the effective tax rate would have been significantly higher than the effective tax rate for the year ended december  accordingly  excluding the gain in from the effective tax rate calculation  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  would have decreased significantly over the prior year 
this improvement was largely the result of improving operating profits in countries with low tax rates 
however  the effective tax rate is higher than the weighted average statutory tax rate applicable in the profitable countries because we have not recorded tax benefit for pretax losses generated in certain countries 
if these countries begin to generate pretax income  and it becomes evident that it is more likely than not that their net operating loss carry forward will offset such income  we expect that our effective tax rate will decrease as we recognize the tax benefit of the losses 
we determine income tax expense and pay income taxes based upon enacted tax laws and regulations applicable in each of the taxing jurisdictions where we conducts business 
based on our interpretation of such laws and regulations  and considering the evidence of available facts and circumstances and baseline operating forecasts  we have accrued the estimated tax effects of certain transactions  business ventures  contractual and organizational structures  projected business unit performance  and the estimated future reversal of timing differences 
should a taxing jurisdiction change its laws and regulations or dispute our conclusions  or should management become aware of new facts or other evidence that could alter our conclusions  the resulting impact to our estimates could have a material adverse effect to our financial statements

equity offerings in november  we raised million in cash through the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock to fletcher international  ltd 
fletcher 
in this transaction  euronet granted fletcher certain additional investment rights entitling 
table of contents fletcher to purchase up to an additional million in value of euronet common stock 
the shares of common stock subject to the additional investment rights were to be purchased at a per share price equal to either i the prevailing price at the time of exercise of the additional investment rights based on a volume weighted average formula or ii if the prevailing price is less than  the prevailing price minus per share 
the additional investment rights were exercisable by fletcher on one or more occasions commencing march   and for the month period thereafter  which could be extended under certain circumstances 
the additional investment rights  under certain circumstances  could be exercised on a net settlement basis  under which fletcher was not required to purchase shares  but received a number of shares of common stock that corresponded to any discount between the price fletcher was to pay for the stock and the then current market price of the common stock that fletcher could have purchased from euronet 
in april  fletcher exercised of its additional investment rights in accordance with its agreement with euronet  resulting in a net share settlement to fletcher of  shares 
in may  fletcher delivered a notice of exercise of the remaining of their additional investment rights  which would result in a net share settlement to fletcher of  shares

in december  fletcher notified euronet that it considered euronet in breach of its obligations under the placement agreement creating the additional investment right 
we believe we have honored all of our obligations under the placement agreement with fletcher relating to the additional purchase rights and that fletcher s assertion of default is without basis 
we will vigorously defend any attempt on fletcher s part to claim the  shares  which is the difference between fletcher s november claim and the may claim 
effective july   we implemented our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  under which employees have the opportunity to purchase common stock through payroll deductions according to specific eligibility and participation requirements 
this plan qualifies as an employee stock purchase plan under section of the internal revenue code of we completed a series of offerings of three months duration with new offerings commencing at the beginning of each quarter 
under the plan  participating employees are granted options  which immediately vest and are automatically exercised on the final date of the respective offering period 
the exercise price of common stock options purchased is the lesser of of the fair market value as defined in the espp of the shares on the first day of each offering or the last day of each offering 
the options are funded by participating employees payroll deductions or cash payments 
under the provisions of the espp  we reserved  shares of common stock all of which we had issued as of december  in february  we adopted a new espp and reserved  shares of common stock for issuance under that plan 
during the years ended december  and  we issued  and  shares at an average price of and per share  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million and million  respectively 
in  we made matching contributions of  shares of stock in conjunction with our k employee benefits plan for the plan year under the terms of this plan  employer matching contributions consist of two parts  referred to as basic and discretionary 
the basic matching contribution is equal to of eligible employee elective salary deferrals between and of participating employee salaries for the plan year 
the discretionary matching contribution is determined by our board of directors for a plan year and is allocated in proportion to employee elective deferrals 
as of december   total employer matching contributions since inception of the plan have consisted of  shares under the basic match and  shares under the discretionary matching contribution 
see note employee benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements 
leases in the eft processing segment  we lease many of our atms under capital lease arrangements that expire between and the leases bear interest between and per year 
as of december   we owed million under these capital lease arrangements 
the majority of these lease agreements are in connection with long term outsourcing agreements where  generally  we purchase a bank s atms and simultaneously sell the atms to an entity related to the bank and lease back the atms for purposes of fulfilling the atm outsourcing agreement with the bank 
we fully recover the related lease costs from the bank under the outsourcing agreements 
generally  the leases are fully cancelable in the unlikely event the bank or we were to cancel the related outsourcing agreement 
we expect that our capital requirements will continue in the future  although our strategy is to focus more on atm outsourcing opportunities rather than atm ownership and deployment as well as redeployment of under performing atms will reduce capital requirements 
moreover  we expect that  if terms were acceptable  we would acquire more atms from banks related to corresponding outsourcing and lease agreements 
capital expenditures and needs in the prepaid processing segment  approximately  of the more than  pos devices that we operate are company owned  with the remaining terminals being operated as integrated cash register devices of our major retail customers or owned by the retailers 
as the 
table of contents prepaid processing segment s business expands  we will continue to add terminals in certain independent retail locations at a price of approximately per terminal 
we expect the proportion of owned terminals to remain at a similar percent of total terminals operated 
we are required to maintain atm hardware and software in accordance with certain regulations and mandates established by local country regulatory and administrative bodies as well as europay  mastercard and visa emv 
accordingly  we expect additional capital expenditures over the next few years to maintain compliance with these regulations and or mandates 
upgrades to our atm software and hardware were required in and continue into to meet emv mandates such as triple des data encryption standard and micro chip card technology for smart cards 
we completed a plan for implementation and delivery of the hardware and software modifications  our capital expenditures necessary to complete these upgrade requirements is approximately million to million 
we will meet this obligation through cash flows and capital lease transactions 
capital expenditures  including fixed assets  capital leases and purchased software  for were million  million for and million for this increase is due primarily to atm outsourcing agreements in hungary and poland and atm upgrades in germany 
the reductions in capital expenditures in compared to generally related to our strategy shift from owning atms to managing atms on an outsourced basis 
in and we were increasing the number of atms we independently owned and operated 
in addition  in we commissioned our new eft processing data center in budapest  hungary as well as the alternative business interruption center in budapest 
capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million to million 
this increase is largely the upgrade of atms to meet emv requirements and micro chip card technology  the purchase of terminals for the prepaid processing segment and office and data center computer equipment and software 
with respect to the remaining capital expenditures  we anticipate that we will fund their purchases under lease terms acceptable to us or with cash 
at current and projected cash flow levels together with cash on hand and amounts available under our recently signed revolving credit agreements  we anticipate that our cash will be sufficient to meet our debt  leasing  acquisition earn out and capital expenditure obligations 
if our cash is insufficient to meet these obligations  we will seek to refinance this debt 
however  we can offer no assurances that we will be able to obtain favorable terms for the refinancing of any of the debt or obligations described above 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet items we have certain significant off balance sheet items see note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
we entered into three acquisition agreements during and two acquisitions in that include obligations to make additional payments to the sellers based upon the future performance of the businesses acquired 
the purchase agreements for eps  cpi  movilcarga  transact and aim contain earn out provisions requiring issuance of cash or euronet common stock  subject to performance criteria 
we estimate that the earn outs for eps and cpi will be approximately million and million  respectively  as well as between million to million approximately million to million for movilcarga 
the earn out for transact has been determined at million 
the earn out obligation for aim was fully settled through the issuance of euronet common stock in september the transact earn out was fully settled in cash and common stock subsequent to december  we can offer no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain financing to meet remaining our obligations when due 
see note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of these acquisitions 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years debt obligations acquisition earn out obligations capital leases operating leases lines of credit operating and asset based indebtedness purchase obligations total for additional information on each of these items  see note debt obligations and note leases to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include contractual amounts for atm maintenance  cleaning  telecommunication and cash replenishment operating expenses 
while contractual payments may be greater or less based on the number of atms and transaction levels  purchase obligations listed above are estimated based on current levels of such business activity 
as of december   we have standby letters of credit issued on its behalf in the amount of approximately million 
these standby letters of credit are fully collateralized by cash deposits held by the respective issuing banks 
we are from time to time a party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business 
currently  there are no legal proceedings that management believes would have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
euronet worldwide  inc regularly grants guarantees of the obligations of its wholly owned subsidiaries 
as of december   euronet worldwide  inc had granted guarantees of the following obligations and amounts cash in various atm networks million over the five to six year terms of the cash supply agreements 
vendor supply agreements million over the term of the vendor agreements 
commercial obligations of our australian prepaid processing subsidiary  including pin inventory held on consignment with our customers  to a maximum of approximately million as of december  from time to time  euronet enters into agreements with unaffiliated parties that contain indemnification provisions  the terms of which may vary depending on the negotiated terms of each respective agreement 
the amount of such obligations is not stated in the agreements 
our liability under such indemnification provision may be subject to time and materiality limitations  monetary caps and other conditions and defenses 
such indemnity obligations include the following in connection with the license of proprietary systems to customers  we provide certain warranties and infringement indemnities to the licensee  which generally warrant that such systems do not infringe on intellectual property owned by third parties and that the systems will perform in accordance with their specifications 
we have entered into purchase and service agreements with our vendors and into consulting agreements with providers of consulting services  pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify certain of such vendors and consultants  respectively  against third party claims arising from our use of the vendor s product or the services of the vendor or consultant 
in connection with our disposition of subsidiaries  operating units and business assets  we have entered into agreements containing indemnification provisions  which are generally described as follows i in connection with acquisitions made by euronet  we have agreed to indemnify the seller against third party claims made against the seller relating to the subject subsidiary  operating unit or asset and arising after the closing of the transaction  and ii in connection with dispositions made by us  we have agreed to indemnify the buyer against damages incurred by the buyer due to the buyer s reliance on representations and warranties relating to the subject subsidiary  operating unit or business assets in the disposition agreement if such representations or warranties were untrue when made 
we have entered into agreements with certain third parties  including banks that provide fiduciary and other services to euronet or to our benefit plans 
under such agreements  we have agreed to indemnify such service providers for third party claims relating to the carrying out of their respective duties under such agreements 

table of contents to date  we are not aware of any significant claims made by the indemnified parties or parties to guarantee agreements with us and  accordingly  no liabilities have been recorded as of december  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management of the company to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and for which the actual results will emerge over time 
these judgments  assumptions and estimates affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note summary of significant accounting policies and practices to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our most critical estimates and assumptions are used for assessing the collectibility of accounts receivable  computing income taxes  estimating the useful lives and potential impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  as well as allocating the purchase price to assets acquired in acquisitions 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies are forward looking statements and are impacted significantly by estimates and should be read in conjunction with risk factors 
actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward looking statements 
accounting for income taxes the deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded under the liability method 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and immediately recognizes changes in income tax laws upon enactment 
the income statement effect is generally derived from changes in deferred income taxes  net of valuation allowances  on the balance sheet as measured by differences in the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we have significant tax loss carryforwards and other temporary differences  which are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets realizable in future periods are recorded  net of a valuation allowance based on an assessment of each entity s or group of entities ability to generate sufficient taxable income within an appropriate period  in a specific tax jurisdiction 
in assessing the recognition of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as more fully described in note taxes to the consolidated financial statements  gross deferred tax assets were million as of december   substantially offset by a valuation allowance of million 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we make judgments and estimates on the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and current projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowance at december  as requisite history of taxable income is established in certain of the countries in which we operate and baseline forecasts project continued taxable income in these countries  we will reduce the valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that will be considered realizable 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant equipment and intangibles assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the respective asset 
the same estimates are also used in planning for our long and short range business planning and forecasting 
we assess the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the respective asset 
assets to be disposed are required to be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are required to be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability 
table of contents sections of the balance sheet 
reviewing long lived assets for impairment requires considerable judgment 
estimating the future cash flows requires significant judgment 
if future cash flows do not materialize as expected or there is a future adverse change in market conditions  the company may be unable to recover the carrying amount of an asset  resulting in future impairment losses 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  the company allocates the purchase price of its acquisitions to the tangible assets  liabilities and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired is supported by valuations using estimates and assumptions provided by management 
for larger acquisitions management engaged an appraiser to assist in the evaluation 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
as of december   the company s balance sheet included goodwill of million  of which relates to the company s prepaid processing segment  and acquired intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of million  all of which relates to prepaid processing segment 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired  the company is required to identify and determine the carrying value of its reporting units  by assigning assets and liabilities  including goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment tests are performed annually during the fourth quarter and are performed at the reporting unit level 
generally  fair value represents discounted projected future cash flows and potential impairment is indicated when the carrying value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds its fair value 
if potential for impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value 
the company s annual impairment tests during  and  as well as the initial impairment test upon adoption of sfas no 
in  indicated that there were no impairments 
estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units requires significant judgment 
if future cash flows do not materialize as expected or there is a future adverse change in market conditions  the company may be unable to recover the carrying amount of an asset  resulting in future impairment losses 
subsequent events acquisition of dynamic telecard  inc in march the company acquired the assets of dynamic telecard  inc dtc  a us based top up company that distributes prepaid services via pos terminals 
dtc delivers several types of prepaid products including wireless  long distance and gift cards 
the assets of dtc were initially purchased on an earn out basis through the issuance of  shares of euronet common stock  of which  shares will be held in escrow and released  subject to certain performance criteria and indemnification claims 
the earn out will be calculated based on certain performance criteria as specified in the purchase agreement  and is estimated to be between million and million 
the company has the option of paying the earn out in euronet common stock or a combination of cash and euronet common stock

table of contents forward looking statements this document contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the us securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this document are forward looking statements  including statements regarding the following our business plans and financing plans and requirements  trends affecting our business plans and financing plans and requirements  trends affecting our business  the adequacy of capital to meet our capital requirements and expansion plans  the assumptions underlying our business plans  business strategy  government regulatory action  technological advances  or projected costs and revenues 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
forward looking statements are typically identified by the words believe  expect  anticipated  intend  estimate and similar expressions 
investors are cautioned that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may materially differ from those in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including the following technological and business developments in the local card  electronic and mobile banking and mobile phone markets affecting transaction and other fees that we are able to charge for our services  foreign exchange fluctuations  competition from bank owned atm networks  outsource providers of atm services  providers of prepaid mobile phone services and software providers  our relationships with our major customers  sponsor banks in various markets  international card organizations and mobile operators  including the risk of contract terminations with our major clients  or changes in laws and regulations affecting our business 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of the debentures and our common stock could decline substantially 
this prospectus also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including the risks described below and elsewhere in this prospectus 
risks related to our business we have a substantial amount of debt and other contractual commitments  and the cost of servicing those obligations could adversely affect our business and hinder our ability to make payments on the debentures  and such risk could increase if we incur more debt 

table of contents we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   our total liabilities were approximately million and our total assets were approximately million 
in addition  we will have to pay approximately million as deferred consideration in connection with the cpi and the meflur acquisitions 
a portion of these obligations may be paid in stock 
while we expect to satisfy such obligations from available cash and operating cash flows  we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all such obligations as a result of a variety of factors  some of which may be beyond our control 
if the opportunity of a strategic acquisition arises or if we enter into new contracts that require the installation or servicing of atm machines on a faster pace than anticipated  we may be required to incur additional debt for these purposes and to fund our working capital needs  which we may not be able to obtain 
the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to investors  including the following our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes may be limited or financing may be unavailable  a substantial portion of our cash flows must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and other obligations and will not be available for use in our business  our level of indebtedness could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the markets in which we operate  our high degree of indebtedness will make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions and or a downturn in our business  thereby making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  and because a portion of our indebtedness and other obligations are denominated in other currencies  and because a portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate of interest  our actual debt service obligations could increase as a result of adverse changes in currency exchange and interest rates 
if we fail to make required debt payments  or if we fail to comply with other covenants in our debt service agreements  we would be in default under the terms of these agreements 
this would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate repayment of this debt and could cause defaults under other indebtedness that we have 
although we have reported net income in recent periods  our concentration on expansion of our business in the future may significantly impact our ability to continue to report net income 
during the period from january  through december   we reported a net loss in each of these fiscal years  primarily attributable to our investments for the expansion of our business 
we believe these investments have recently started to produce positive results for us  as evidenced by our reporting of net income of approximately million for the year ended december  we may experience operating losses again in the future while we continue to concentrate on expansion of our business and increasing our market share 
restrictive covenants in our credit facilities may adversely affect us 
our credit facilities contain a variety of restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur debt  make investments  pay dividends and sell assets 
in addition  these facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios  including debt to ebitda and ebitdar to fixed charges  and satisfy other financial condition tests  including a minimum ebitda test 
see description of credit facility 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facilities 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facilities  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
we have pledged a substantial portion of our assets as security under the credit facilities 
if the lenders under either credit facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness  including the notes 
the debt to ebitda ratio contained in the credit facilities limits our funded debt to not more than two times our ebitda for the last four quarters  in each case as defined in the credit facilities 
ebitda includes the historical pro forma effect of any acquisitions to the extent agreed to by the lenders 
funded debt is defined as certain debt minus proceeds of this offering so long as such proceeds are deposited in designated accounts 
we will deposit a substantial portion of the proceeds into such accounts in order to comply with such covenant 
following this offering  we will only be able to utilize the proceeds of this offering or incur additional debt to the extent that  after giving effect to such utilization  our debt less the remaining amount of proceeds in such account is less 
table of contents than two times our ebitda  including historical pro forma effect of any acquisitions 
accordingly  our ability to use the proceeds of this offering or incur additional debt for purposes other than debt repayment or for acquisitions that increase our ebitda  will be limited until such time as our ebitda increases 
our business may suffer from risks related to our recent acquisitions and potential future acquisitions 
a substantial portion of our recent growth is due to acquisitions  and we continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate  or otherwise realize anticipated benefits from  our recent acquisitions  including the e pay  transact  precept  eps  cpi  aim and movilcarga  or any future acquisitions  which could adversely impact our long term competitiveness and profitability 
the integration of our recent acquisitions and any future acquisitions will involve a number of risks that could harm our financial condition  results of operations and competitive position 
in particular the integration plan for our acquisitions assumes benefits based on analyses that involve assumptions as to future events  including leveraging our existing relationships with mobile phone operators and retailers  as well as general business and industry conditions  many of which are beyond our control and may not materialize 
unforeseen factors may offset components of our integration plan in whole or in part 
as a result  our actual results may vary considerably  or be considerably delayed  compared to our estimates  the integration process could disrupt the activities of the businesses that are being combined 
the combination of companies requires  among other things  coordination of administrative and other functions 
in addition  the loss of key employees  customers or vendors of acquired businesses could materially and adversely impact the integration of the acquired business  the execution of our integration plans may divert the attention of our management from operating our business  or we may assume unanticipated liabilities and contingencies 
future acquisitions may be affected through the issuance of our common stock  or securities convertible into our common stock  which could substantially dilute the ownership percentage of our current stockholders 
in addition  shares issued in connection with future acquisitions could be publicly tradable  which could result in a material decrease in the market price of our common stock 
a lack of business opportunities or financial resources may impede our ability to continue to expand at desired levels  and our failure to expand operations could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 
our expansion plans and opportunities are focused on three separate areas i our network of owned and operated atms  ii outsourced atm management contracts  and iii our prepaid mobile phone airtime services 
the continued expansion and development of our atm business will depend on various factors including the following the demand for our atm services in our current target markets  the ability to locate appropriate atm sites and obtain necessary approvals for the installation of atms  the ability to install atms in an efficient and timely manner  the expansion of our business into new countries as currently planned  entering into additional card acceptance and atm management agreements with banks  the ability to obtain sufficient numbers of atms on a timely basis  and the availability of financing for the expansion 
we carefully monitor the growth of our atm networks in each of our markets  and we accelerate or delay our expansion plans depending on local market conditions  such as variations in the transaction fees we receive  competition  overall trends in atm transaction levels and performance of individual atms 
we cannot predict the increase or decrease in the number of atms we manage under outsourcing agreements  because this depends largely on the willingness of banks to enter into outsourcing contracts with us 
banks are very deliberate in negotiating these agreements and the process of negotiating and signing outsourcing agreements typically takes six to months or longer 
moreover  banks evaluate a wide range of matters when deciding to choose an outsource vendor and generally this decision is subject to extensive management analysis and approvals 
the process is exacerbated by the legal and regulatory considerations of local countries  as well as local language complexities 
these agreements tend to cover large numbers of atms  so significant increases and 
table of contents decreases in our pool of managed atms could result from signature or termination of these management contracts 
in this regard  the timing of both current and new contract revenues is uncertain and unpredictable 
we currently offer prepaid mobile phone top up services in the us  europe and asia pacific we plan to expand our top up business in these and other markets by taking advantage of our existing relationships with mobile phone operators and retailers 
this expansion will depend on various factors  including the following the ability to negotiate new agreements in these markets with mobile phone operators and retailers  the continuation of the trend of increased use of electronic prepaid airtime among mobile phone users  the development of mobile phone networks in these markets and the increase in the number of mobile phone users  or the availability of financing for the expansion 
in addition  our continued expansion may involve acquisitions that could divert our resources and management time and require integration of new assets with our existing networks and services and could require financing that we may not be able to obtain 
our ability to manage our rapid expansion effectively will require us eventually to expand our operating systems and employee base 
an inability to do this could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
we are subject to business cycles and other outside factors that may negatively affect mobile phone operators  retailers and our customers 
a recessionary economic environment or other outside factors could have a negative impact on mobile phone operators  retailers and our customers and could reduce the level of atm transactions  which could  in turn  negatively impact our financial results 
if mobile phone operators experience decreased demand for their prepaid products and services including due to increasing usage of postpaid services or if the retail locations where we provide pos top up services decrease in number  we will process fewer transactions  resulting in lower revenue 
in addition  a recessionary economic environment could result in a higher rate of bankruptcy filings by mobile phone operators  retailers and our customers and could reduce the level of atm transactions  which will have a negative impact on our business 
our prepaid mobile airtime top up business may be susceptible to fraud occurring at the retailer level 
in our prepaid processing segment  we contract with retailers that accept payment on our behalf  which we then transfer to a trust or other operating account for payment to mobile phone operators 
in the event a retailer does not transfer to us payments that it receives for mobile phone airtime  we are responsible to the mobile phone operator for the cost of the airtime credited to the customer s mobile phone 
although  in certain circumstances  we maintain credit enhancement insurance polices and take other precautions to mitigate this risk  we can provide no assurance that retailer fraud will not increase in the future or that any proceeds we receive under our insurance policies will be adequate to cover losses resulting from retailer fraud  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because we typically enter into short term contracts with mobile phone operators and retailers  our top up business is subject to the risk of non renewal of those contracts 
our contracts with mobile phone operators to process prepaid mobile phone airtime recharge services typically have terms of two to three years or less 
many of those contracts may be canceled by either party upon three months notice 
our contracts with mobile phone operators are not exclusive  so these operators may enter into top up contracts with other service providers 
in addition  our top up service contracts with major retailers typically have terms of one to two years and our contracts with smaller retailers typically may be canceled by either party upon three months notice 
the cancellation or non renewal of one or more of our significant mobile phone operator or retail contracts  or of a large enough group of our contracts with smaller retailers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our contracts generally permit operators to reduce our fees at any time 
commission revenue or fee reductions by any of the mobile phone operators could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in the us and certain other countries  processes we employ may be subject to patent protection by other parties 
we have commenced prepaid processing operations in the us the contribution of these operations to our financial results is currently insignificant  but we hope to expand this business rapidly 
in the us  patent protection legislation permits the protection of processes 
we employ certain processes in the us that have been used in the industry by other parties for many years  and which we and other companies using the same or similar processes consider to be in the public domain 
however  we are aware that certain parties believe they hold patents that cover some of the processes employed in the prepaid processing industry in the us the question whether a process is in the public domain is a legal determination  and if this issue is litigated we cannot be certain of the outcome of any such litigation 
if a person were to assert that it holds a patent covering any of the processes we use  we would be required to defend ourselves against such claim and if unsuccessful  would be required to either modify our processes or pay license 
table of contents fees for the use of such processes 
this could materially and adversely affect our us prepaid processing business and could result in our reconsidering the rate of expansion of this business in the us the level of transactions on our atm and prepaid processing networks is subject to substantial seasonal variation  which may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate materially and create volatility in the price of our shares 
our experience is that the level of transactions on our networks is subject to substantial seasonal variation 
transaction levels have consistently been much higher in the last quarter of the year due to increased use of atms and prepaid top ups during the holiday season 
the level of transactions drops in the first quarter  during which transaction levels are generally the lowest we experience during the year 
since revenues of the eft processing and prepaid processing segments are primarily transaction based  these segments are directly affected by this cyclicality 
as a result of these seasonal variations  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially and could lead to volatility in the price of our shares 
the stability and growth of our atm business depend on maintaining our current card acceptance and atm management agreements with banks and international card organizations  and on securing new arrangements for card acceptance and atm management 
the stability and future growth of our atm business depend in part on our ability to sign card acceptance and atm management agreements with banks and international card organizations 
card acceptance agreements allow our atms to accept credit and debit cards issued by banks and international card organizations 
atm management agreements generate service income from our management of atms for banks 
these agreements are the primary source of our atm business 
these agreements have expiration dates and banks and international card organizations are generally not obligated to renew them 
in some cases  banks may terminate their contracts prior to the expiration of their terms 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to sign or maintain these agreements on terms and conditions acceptable to us or that international card organizations will continue to permit our atms to accept their credit and debit cards 
the inability to continue to sign or maintain these agreements  or to continue to accept the credit and debit cards of local banks and international card organizations at our atms in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
retaining the founders of our company  and of companies that we acquire  and finding and retaining qualified personnel in europe may be important to our continued success 
our strategy and its implementation depend in large part on the founders of our company  in particular michael brown and daniel henry  and their continued involvement in euronet in the future 
in addition  the success of the expansion of businesses that we acquire may depend in large part upon the retention of the founders of those businesses 
our success also depends in part on our ability to hire and retain highly skilled and qualified management  operating  marketing  financial and technical personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel in central europe and the other markets where we conduct our business is intense and  accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to hire or retain the required personnel 
our officers and some of our key personnel have entered into service or employment agreements containing non competition  non disclosure and non solicitation covenants and providing for the granting of incentive stock options with long term vesting requirements 
however  most of these contracts do not guarantee that these individuals will continue their employment with us 
the loss of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
our operating results depend in part on the volume of transactions on atms in our network and the fees we can collect from processing these transactions 
transaction fees from banks and international card organizations for transactions processed on our atms have historically accounted for a substantial majority of our revenues 
these fees are set by agreement among all banks in a particular market 
although we are less dependent on these fees due to our prepaid processing segment  the future operating results of our atm business depend on the following factors the increased issuance of credit and debit cards  the increased acceptance of our atm processing and management services in our target markets  the maintenance of the level of transaction fees we receive  the installation of larger numbers of atms  and the continued use of our atms by credit and debit cardholders 
although we believe that the volume of transactions in developing countries will tend to increase due to growth in the number of cards being issued by banks in these markets  we anticipate that transaction levels on any given atm in developing markets will 
table of contents not increase significantly 
we can improve the levels of transactions on our atm network overall by acquiring good sites for our atms  eliminating poor locations  entering new less developed markets and adding new transactions to the sets of transactions that are available on our atms 
however  we may not be successful in materially increasing transaction levels through these measures 
per transaction fees have declined in certain markets in recent years 
if we cannot continue to increase our transaction levels and per transaction fees generally decline  our results would be adversely affected 
our operating results depend in part on the volume of transactions for pre paid phone services and the commissions we receive for these services 
our prepaid processing segment derives revenues based on processing fees from mobile and other telecommunication operators or distributors of prepaid wireless products 
generally  these operators have the right to reduce the overall fee paid for each transaction  although a portion of such reductions can be passed along to retailers 
in the last year  processing fees per transaction have been declining in most markets  and we expect that trend to continue 
we have been able to improve our results despite that trend due to substantial growth in transactions  driven by acquisitions and organic growth 
we do not expect to continue this rate of growth 
if we cannot continue to increase our transaction levels and per transaction fees continue to decline  our results would be adversely affected 
developments in electronic financial transactions  such as the increased use of debit cards by customers and pass through of atm transaction fees by banks to customers or developments in the mobile phone industry  could materially reduce atm transaction levels and our revenues 
certain developments in the field of electronic financial transactions may reduce the amount of cash that individuals need on a daily basis  including the promotion by international card organizations and banks of the use of bank debit cards for transactions of small amounts 
these developments may reduce the transaction levels that we experience on our atms in the markets where they occur 
banks also could elect to pass through to their customers all  or a large part of  the fees we charge for transactions on our atms 
this would increase the cost of using our atm machines to the banks customers  which may cause a decline in the use of our atm machines and  thus  have an adverse effect on revenues 
if transaction levels over our existing atm network do not increase  growth in our revenues from the atms we own will depend primarily on rolling out atms at new sites and developing new markets  which requires capital investment and resources and reduces the margin we realize from our revenues 
the mobile phone industry is a rapidly evolving area  in which technological developments  in particular the development of new methods or services  may affect the demand for other services in a dramatic way 
the development of any new technology that reduces the need or demand for prepaid mobile phone time could materially and adversely affect our business 
we generally have little control over the atm transaction fees established in the markets where we operate  and therefore cannot control any potential reductions in these fees 
the amount of fees we receive per transaction is set in various ways in the markets in which we do business 
we have card acceptance agreements or atm management agreements with some banks under which fees are set 
however  we derive the bulk of our revenues in most markets from interchange fees that are set by the central atm processing switch 
the banks that participate in these switches set the interchange fee  and we are not in a position in any market to greatly influence these fees  which may increase or decrease over time 
a significant decrease in the interchange fee in any market could adversely affect our results in that market 
in some cases  we are dependent upon international card organizations and national transaction processing switches to provide assistance in obtaining settlement from card issuers of funds relating to transactions on our atms 
our atms dispense cash relating to transactions on credit and debit cards issued by banks 
we have in place arrangements for the settlement to us of all of those transactions  but in some cases we do not have a direct relationship with the card issuing bank and rely for settlement on the application of rules that are administered by international card associations such as visa or mastercard or national transaction processing switching networks 
if a bankcard association fails to settle transactions in accordance with those rules  we are dependent upon cooperation from such organizations or switching networks to enforce our right of settlement against such banks or card associations 
failure by such organizations or switches to provide the required cooperation could result in our inability to obtain settlement of funds relating to transactions and adversely affect our business 
we derive a significant amount of revenue in our business from service contracts signed with financial institutions to own and or operate their atm machines 
certain contracts have been and  in the future  may be terminated by the financial institution resulting in a substantial reduction in revenue 
contract termination payments  if any  may be inadequate to replace revenues and operating income associated with these contracts 

table of contents because our business is highly dependent on the proper operation of our computer network and telecommunications connections  significant technical disruptions to these systems would adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
our business involves the operation and maintenance of a sophisticated computer network and telecommunications connections with banks  financial institutions  mobile operators and retailers 
this  in turn  requires the maintenance of computer equipment and infrastructure  including telecommunications and electrical systems  and the integration and enhancement of complex software applications 
our atm segment also uses a satellite based system that is susceptible to the risk of satellite failure 
there are operational risks inherent in this type of business that can result in the temporary shutdown of part or all of our processing systems  such as failure of electrical supply  failure of computer hardware and software errors 
excluding our german atms  we operate all of our atms through our processing centers in budapest  hungary and mumbai  india  and any operational problem in these centers may have a significant adverse impact on the operation of our network generally 
in addition  we operate all of our top up services through our processing centers in the uk  germany  spain and the us  and any operational problem there could have a significant adverse impact on the operation of our top up network 
we employ experienced operations and computer development staff and have created redundancies and procedures in our processing centers to decrease these risks 
however  these risks cannot be eliminated entirely 
any technical failure that prevents operation of our systems for a significant period of time will prevent us from processing transactions during that period of time and will directly and adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
we have the risk of liability for fraudulent bankcard and other card transactions involving a breach in our security systems  as well as for atm theft and vandalism 
we capture  transmit  handle and store sensitive information in conducting and managing electronic  financial and mobile transactions  such as card information and pin numbers 
these businesses involve certain inherent security risks  in particular the risk of electronic interception and theft of the information for use in fraudulent card transactions 
we incorporate industry standard encryption technology and processing methodology into our systems and software to maintain high levels of security 
although this technology and methodology decrease security risks  they cannot be eliminated entirely  as criminal elements apply increasingly sophisticated technology to attempt to obtain unauthorized access to the information handled by atm and electronic financial transaction networks 
any breach in our security systems could result in the perpetration of fraudulent financial transactions for which we may be found liable 
we are insured against various risks  including theft and negligence  but our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles  exclusions and limitations that may leave us bearing some or all of any losses arising from security breaches 
in addition to electronic fraud issues  the possible theft and vandalism of atms present risks for our atm business 
we install atms at high traffic sites and consequently our atms are exposed to theft and vandalism 
although we are insured against these risks  exclusions or limitations in our insurance coverage may leave us bearing some or all of any loss arising from theft or vandalism of atms 
we are required under german law and the rules of financial transaction switching networks in all of our markets to have sponsors to operate atms and switch atm transactions 
our failure to secure sponsor arrangements in any market could prevent us from doing business in that market 
under german law  only a licensed financial institution may operate atms  and we are therefore required to have a sponsor bank to conduct our german atm operations 
in addition  in all of our markets  our atms are connected to national financial transaction switching networks owned or operated by banks  and to other international financial transaction switching networks operated by organizations such as citibank  visa and mastercard 
the rules governing these switching networks require any company sending transactions through these switches to be a bank or a technical service processor that is approved and monitored by a bank 
as a result  the operation of our atm network in all of our markets depends on our ability to secure these sponsor type arrangements with financial institutions 
to date  we have been successful in reaching contractual arrangements that have permitted us to operate in all of our target markets 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in reaching these arrangements  and it is possible that our current arrangements will not continue to be renewed 
our competition in the eft processing segment and prepaid processing segment include large  well financed companies and banks and  in the software market  companies larger than us with earlier entry into the market 
as a result  we may lack the financial resources and access needed to capture increased market share 
eft processing segment our principal eft processing competitors include atm networks owned by banks and national switches consisting of consortiums of local banks that provide outsourcing and transaction services only to banks and independent atm deployers in that country 
large  well financed companies that operate atms offer atm network and outsourcing services that compete with us in various markets 
none of these competitors have dominant market share 
competitive factors in our eft 
table of contents processing segment include network availability and response time  price to both the bank and to its customers  atm location and access to other networks 
certain independent non bank owned companies provide electronic recharge on atms in individual markets in which we provide this service 
we are not aware of any individual independent companies providing electronic recharge on atms across multiple markets in which we provide this service 
in this area  we believe competition will come principally from the banks providing such services on their own atms through relationships with mobile operators or from card transaction switching networks that add recharge transaction capabilities to their offerings as is the case in the uk through the link network 
prepaid processing segment we face competition in the prepaid business in all of our markets 
a few multinational companies operate in several of our markets  and we therefore compete with them in a number of countries 
in other markets  our competition is from smaller  local companies 
none of these companies is dominant in any of the markets where we do business 
we believe  however  that we currently have a competitive advantage due to various factors 
first  in the uk  germany and australia  our acquired subsidiaries have been concentrating on the sale of prepaid airtime for longer than most of our competitors and have significant market share in those markets 
we have approximately of the pos recharge market in the uk  in germany and in australia 
in addition  we offer complementary atm and mobile recharge solutions through our eft processing centers 
we believe this will improve our ability to solicit the use of networks of devices owned by third parties for example  banks and switching networks to deliver recharge services 
in selected developing markets  we hope to establish a first to market advantage by rolling out terminals rapidly before competition is established 
we also have an extremely flexible technical platform that enables us to tailor pos solutions to individual merchant and mobile operator requirements where appropriate 
the gprs wireless technology  designed by our transact subsidiary  will also give us an advantage in remote areas where landline phone lines are of lesser quality or nonexistent 
the principal competitive factors in this area include price that is  the level of commission charged for each recharge transaction and up time offered on the system 
major retailers with high volumes are in a position to demand a larger share of the commission  which increases the amount of competition among service providers 
software solutions segment we are the leading supplier of electronic financial transaction processing software for the ibm iseries formerly as platform in a largely fragmented market  which is made up of competitors that offer a variety of solutions that compete with our products  ranging from single applications to fully integrated electronic financial processing software 
other industry suppliers service the software requirements of large mainframe systems and unix based platforms  and accordingly are not considered competitors 
we have specific target customers consisting of financial institutions that operate their back office systems with the ibm iseries 
the software solutions segment has multiple types of competitors 
competitors of the software solutions segment compete across all eft software components in the following areas i atm  network and pos software systems  ii internet banking software systems  iii credit card software systems  iv mobile banking systems  v mobile operator solutions  vi telephone banking  and vii full eft software 
competitive factors in the software solutions business include price  technology development and the ability of software systems to interact with other leading products 
we conduct a significant portion of our business in central and eastern european countries  and we have subsidiaries in the middle east and asia  where the risk of continued political  economic and regulatory change that could impact our operating results is greater than in the us or western europe 
certain tax jurisdictions that we operate in have complex rules regarding the valuation of inter company services  cross border payments between affiliated companies and the related effects on income tax  value added tax vat  transfer tax and share registration tax 
our foreign subsidiaries frequently undergo vat reviews  and two of our subsidiaries are currently undergoing comprehensive tax reviews 
from time to time  we may be reviewed by tax authorities and be required to make additional tax payments should the review result in different interpretations  allocations or valuations of our services 
we obtain legal  tax and regulatory advice as necessary to ensure compliance with tax and regulatory matters 
we have subsidiaries in hungary  poland  the czech republic  romania  slovakia  spain  greece  croatia  india  egypt and indonesia and have operations in other countries in central europe  the middle east and asia 
we sell software in many other markets in the developing world 
these countries have undergone significant political  economic and social change in recent years and the risk of new  unforeseen changes in these countries remains greater than in the us or western europe 
in particular  changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations  whether caused by a change in government or otherwise  could materially adversely affect our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
for example  currently there are no limitations on the repatriation of profits from any of the countries in which we have subsidiaries although us tax laws discourage repatriation  but foreign exchange control restrictions  taxes or limitations may be 
table of contents imposed or increased in the future with regard to repatriation of earnings and investments from these countries 
if exchange control restrictions  taxes or limitations are imposed  our ability to receive dividends or other payments from affected subsidiaries could be reduced  which may have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  corporate  contract  property  insolvency  competition  securities and other laws and regulations in hungary  poland  the czech republic  romania  croatia and other countries in central europe have been  and continue to be  substantially revised during the completion of their transition to market economies 
therefore  the interpretation and procedural safeguards of the new legal and regulatory systems are in the process of being developed and defined  and existing laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently 
also  in some circumstances  it may not be possible to obtain the legal remedies provided for under these laws and regulations in a reasonably timely manner  if at all 
transmittal of data by electronic means and telecommunications is subject to specific regulation in most central european countries 
although these regulations have not had a material impact on our business to date  changes in these regulations  including taxation or limitations on transfers of data across national borders  could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
because we derive our revenue from a multitude of countries with different currencies  our business is affected by local inflation and foreign exchange rates and policies 
we attempt to match any assets denominated in a currency with liabilities denominated in the same currency 
nonetheless  substantially all of our indebtedness is denominated in us dollars  euro and british pounds 
while a significant amount of our expenditures  including the acquisition of atms  executive salaries and certain long term telecommunication contracts  are made in us dollars  most of our revenues are denominated in other currencies 
the us dollar has recently declined significantly against these currencies 
as exchange rates among the us dollar  the euro  and other currencies fluctuate  the translation effect of these fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition as reported in us dollars 
moreover  exchange rate policies have not always allowed for the free conversion of currencies at the market rate 
an increase in the value of the dollar would have an adverse effect on our results 
in recent years  hungary  poland and the czech republic have experienced high levels of inflation 
consequently  these countries currencies have continued to decline in value against the major currencies of the organization of economic cooperation and development oecd countries over this time period 
due to the significant reduction in the inflation rate of these countries in recent years  none of these countries are considered to have a hyper inflationary economy 
nonetheless  rates of inflation in these countries may continue to fluctuate from time to time 
the majority of our subsidiaries revenues are denominated in the local currency 
our directors and officers  together with the entities with which they are associated  owned about of our common stock as of december   giving them significant control over decisions related to our company 
this control includes the ability to influence the election of other directors of our company and to cast a large block of votes with respect to virtually all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
this concentration of control may have the effect of delaying or preventing transactions or a potential change of control of our company 
the sale of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market could materially decrease the market price of our common stock  and about of our outstanding common stock  cannot currently be traded publicly  but may be publicly traded in blocks in the future because we have filed resale registrations statements for a majority of such shares or such shares have been held by non affiliates for more than two years 
if a substantial amount of our common stock were sold in the public market  or even targeted for sale  this could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our ability to sell common stock in the future 
as of december   we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding  of which approximately million shares including the shares we issued in the transact acquisition  the fletcher financing  the precept and the cpi acquisitions  or about  cannot currently be traded on the public market without compliance with rule about million of these shares are held by persons who may be deemed to be our affiliates and who would be subject to rule of the general rules and regulations of the commission 
rule limits the number of shares that affiliates can publicly sell during each day period 
however  over the course of time  these million shares have the potential to be freely publicly traded  perhaps in large blocks 
moreover  we have filed registration statements to permit the resale of a substantial portion of such shares  which would permit them to sell shares at any time without regard to the rule limitations 
we  our executive officers and directors have agreed  subject to limited exceptions  not to directly or indirectly offer  sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of our common stock or any securities convertible or exchangeable into our common stock for a period of days from the date of this prospectus 
however  notwithstanding the foregoing restriction  our executive officers and directors  several of whom have existing rule b plans  may sell shares of our common stock pursuant to such plans during the day lockup period 
in addition  none of our other shareholders have entered into any such lockup agreements 

table of contents an additional million shares of common stock could be added to the total outstanding common stock through the exercise of options or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock pursuant to existing agreements 
this could dilute the ownership percentage of current stockholders 
also  once they are outstanding  these shares of common stock could be traded in the future and result in a material decrease in the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million options outstanding held by our directors  officers and employees  which entitles these holders to acquire an equal number of shares of our common stock on exercise 
of this amount  million options are currently vested  which means they can be exercised at any time 
approximately million additional shares of our common stock are issuable in connection with our employee stock purchase plan 
during the first quarter of  in connection with the acquisition of transact  euronet delivered to the former shareholders of transact million shares of common stock  in settlement of the earn out payment 
additionally  we may be required to issue approximately million shares of our common stock based on current prices and estimated earn out payments to the former shareholders or owners of eps and melfur under contingent earn out payments in connection with these acquisitions 
the number of shares issued under the earn outs will depend upon performance of the businesses acquired and the trading price of our common stock at the time we make the earn out payments 
another million shares of common stock could be issued upon conversion of the company s convertible debentures issued during december accordingly  approximately million shares based on current prices and estimated earn out payments could potentially be added to the total current outstanding common stock through the exercise of options or the issuance of additional shares  and thereby dilute the ownership percentage of the current owners 
the actual number of shares issuable could be higher depending upon the actual amounts of the earn outs and our stock price at the time of payment more shares could be issuable if our share price declines  which could increase dilution and reduce earnings per share 
a significant portion of the shares issuable may be issued as early as the first quarter of the indenture will not contain anti dilution adjustments for such issuances 
of the million total options outstanding  an aggregate of million options are held by persons who may be deemed to be our affiliates and who would be subject to rule thus  upon exercise of their options  these affiliates shares would be subject to the trading restrictions imposed by rule for the remainder of the options and the shares issuable as earn outs described above  the common stock issued on their exercise or conversion would be freely tradable in the public market 
over the course of time  all of the issued shares have the potential to be publicly traded  perhaps in large blocks 
operational risk  security our business involves the operation and maintenance of a sophisticated computer network and telecommunications connections with banks  financial institutions  retailers and mobile operators 
this  in turn  requires the maintenance of computer equipment and infrastructure  including telecommunications and electrical systems  and the integration and enhancement of complex software applications 
certain operational risks inherent in this type of business can require a temporary shut down of parts or all of our processing systems  including failure of electrical supply  failure of computer hardware and software errors 
all of our atms other than our atms in germany are operated through our processing centers in budapest and mumbai and our e top up transactions are processed through our basildon  munich  monzon and us operations centers so any operational problem may have a significant adverse impact on the operation of our network generally 
we have experienced operations and computer development staff and have created disaster recovery procedures  particularly in our budapest and basildon processing centers and soon in speyer  germany  to mitigate such risks  but they cannot be eliminated entirely 
any technical failure that prevents operation of our systems for a significant period of time will prevent us from processing transactions during that period of time and will directly and adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
our atm and pos network systems process electronic financial transactions using information read by atms or pos terminals from bank debit and credit cards or input into our systems by our customers in the registration process for or top up of mobile phone prepaid services 
we capture  transmit  handle and store sensitive bankcard information in performing services for our customers 
in addition  our software is designed to permit the operation by our customers of electronic financial transaction networks similar to our network  so our software is used in handling such information 
these businesses involve certain inherent security risks and in particular the risk of electronic interception and theft of the information for use in fraudulent card transactions 
we have incorporated industry standard encryption technology and processing methodology into our systems and software to maintain high levels of security 
although this technology and methodology mitigates security risks  they cannot be eliminated entirely as criminal elements apply increasingly sophisticated technology to attempt to obtain unauthorized access to the information handled by atm and electronic financial transaction networks 
any breach in our security systems could result in the perpetration of fraudulent financial transactions for which we may be found liable 
we are insured against various risks  including theft and negligence  but such insurance is subject to deductibles  exclusions and limitations that may leave us bearing some or all of any losses arising from security breaches 
in addition to electronic fraud issues  theft and vandalism of atms presents risks for our atm business 
we install atms at sites that are high foot traffic sites and are exposed to theft and vandalism 
although we are insured against such risks  deductibles  exclusions 
table of contents or limitations in such insurance may leave us bearing some or all of any losses arising from theft or vandalism of atms 
in addition  we have experienced increases in claims under our insurance  which has increased our insurance premiums 
foreign exchange exposure in  of our total revenues were generated in poland  hungary  the uk  australia  germany and india as compared to in and in this slight decrease is due to acquisitions in the us and spain  as well as growth in revenues in asian markets 
in hungary  poland and india  the majority of revenues received are denominated in the hungarian forint  polish zloty or indian rupee  respectively 
however  the majority of our foreign currency denominated contracts in hungary and poland are linked to either inflation or the retail price index 
in the uk  australia and germany  of the revenues received are denominated in the british pound  australian dollar and the euro  respectively 
although a significant portion of our expenditures in these countries are still made in or denominated in local currencies  we continue to strive to achieve more of our expenses in local currencies to match our revenues 
we estimate that depreciation in foreign exchange rates of the euro  hungarian forint  polish zloty  the british pounds and australian dollar against the us dollar would have the combined effect of a million increase in the reported net income 
this effect was estimated by segregating revenues and expenses by the us dollar  hungarian forint  polish zloty  british pound  australian dollar  and euro and then applying currency devaluation to the non us dollar amounts 
we estimate that appreciation in foreign exchange rates of the euro  hungarian forint  polish zloty  the british pound and australian dollar against the us dollar would have the combined effect of a million decrease in the reported net income

we believe this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing or operating strategies 
as a result of continued european economic convergence  including the increased influence of the euro as opposed to the us dollar on the central european currencies  we expect that the currencies of the markets where we invest will fluctuate less against the euro and the british pound than against the dollar 
inflation and functional currencies generally  the countries we operate in have experienced low and stable inflation in recent years 
therefore  the local currency in each of these markets is the functional currency 
although croatia has maintained relatively stable inflation and exchange rates  the functional currency of our croatian subsidiary is the us dollar due to the significant level of us dollar denominated revenues and expenses 
due to these factors  we do not believe that inflation will have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we continually review inflation and the functional currency in each of the countries where we operate
