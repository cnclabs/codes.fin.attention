critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
sales returns and allowances the company s ability to collect factor chargebacks for deductions taken by its customers for returns  discounts  and allowances as well as potential future customer deductions is significant to its operations 
the company reserves against known chargebacks as well as potential future customer deductions based on a combination of historical activity and current market conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which may have a significant impact on the company s results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these customers include non factored accounts and credit card receivables from third party service providers 
if the financial conditions of these customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes the company s income taxes are routinely under audit by federal  state  or local authorities 
these audits include questioning the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
based on its annual evaluations of tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent the company is required to pay amounts in excess of recorded income tax liabilities  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially impacted 
litigation the company is periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management is required to assess the probability of any adverse judgements as well as the potential range of any losses 
management determines the required accruals after a careful review of the facts of each significant legal action 
the company s accruals may change in the future due to new developments in these matters 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in and subject to compliance and regulatory reviews and audits by numerous authorities  agencies and other governmental agents and entities from various jurisdictions 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes of these matters 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these reviews are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or final resolution in each matter  which may have a significant impact on the company s results

the company believes the increase in net sales in the consumer direct segment is due in part to the economic strengthening generally seen throughout the retail and apparel industry and direct merchandising initiatives at its outlets 
in an effort to maintain  solidify  and build on the positive sales results  the company will continue to analyze inventory  focus on products and further scrutinize consumer trends 
royalty revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily from incremental minimum royalties from the company s existing licensees  most significantly women s apparel and fragrance  and from the company s new men s casual pants licensee

the associated distribution and merchandising have resulted in creating the current short term sales reduction 
in the longer term  however  the company believes these initiatives will produce a stronger business and a corner stone of the brands

the company believes the increase in comparable store sales was a result of its efforts to adapt its product offerings to better reflect current consumer demands  as well as a general improvement in the economic climate 
in an effort to maintain  solidify  and build on the positive sales results  the company will continue to analyze inventory  focus on products and further scrutinize consumer trends

consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in from in the decrease was primarily due to lower margins in the company s wholesale segment  offset by a greater portion of gross profit  as a percentage of net revenues  by the licensing segment 
the wholesale gross margin percentage eroded primarily as a result of poor sell thrus from the restructuring initiatives in the handbag business and the weakened us dollar compared to the euro  while licensing revenue  which has nominal associated cost of goods  increased as a percentage of net revenues to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the wholesale segment  which operates at a lower gross profit level than the consumer direct segment  decreased its percentage of net revenue to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   while the consumer direct segment as a percentage of net revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the consumer direct margin fell slightly compared to the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses  including warehousing and receiving sg a  increased million  or to million or of net revenues in from million or of net revenues in the decrease as a percentage of net revenues was derived primarily from the economies of scale over the company s fixed base of general and administrative costs offset by higher labor costs within all three segments

the related reduction in income tax expense is expected to be to million 
the company expects to adopt this repatriation plan in the second half of liquidity and capital resources the company s cash requirements are generated primarily from working capital needs  retail expansion  enhanced technology  and other corporate activities 
the company primarily relies upon internally generated cash flows from operations to finance its operations and growth  however  it also has the ability to borrow up to million under its line of credit 
cash flows may vary from time to time as a result of seasonal requirements of inventory  the timing of the delivery of merchandise to customers and the level of accounts receivable and payable balances 
at december   working capital was million compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to increased earnings offset by the timing of various payables and receivables  as well as  the increase in the company s deferred rent obligations

in addition  the company used million to purchase  of its shares in compared to million it used to purchase  shares in as of december   the company has  shares available to be repurchased 
the company currently sells substantially all of its accounts receivable to two factors without recourse 
in circumstances where a customer s account cannot be factored without recourse  the company may take other measures to reduce its credit exposure  which could include requiring the customer to pay in advance  or to provide a letter of credit covering the sales price of the merchandise ordered 
the company s material obligations under contractual agreements  primarily commitments for future payments under operating lease agreements as of december  are summarized as follows payments due by period year after total or less years years years operating leases and other obligations      purchase obligations   total contractual obligations      the company currently has a line of credit  as amended  under which up to million is available to finance working capital requirements and letters of credit to finance the company s inventory purchases 
borrowings available under the line of credit are determined by a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventories and bear interest at i the higher of the bank of new york s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus at the date of borrowing or ii a negotiated rate 
in connection with the line of credit  the company has agreed to eliminate all the outstanding borrowings under the facility for at least consecutive days during each calendar year 
in addition  borrowings under the line of credit are secured by certain receivables of the company 
the company had no outstanding advances during and under this line of credit  however amounts available under the line were reduced by million open letters of credit and million standby letters of credit to million at december  during  the company anticipates opening or expanding approximately to retail and outlet stores 
these new and expanded stores will require approximately million in aggregate capital expenditures and initial inventory requirements 
the company also anticipates that it will require increased capital expenditures to support its information systems over its historical spend

the closing date must occur by may  the specific timing to be determined by the parties  based on the ability of the current landlord to satisfy certain terms and conditions 
the company has incurred approximately million in capital expenditures and expects to expend another million within the next year related to this location

exchange rates the company routinely enters into forward exchange contracts for its future purchases of inventory denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
at december   forward exchange contracts with a notional value totaling million were outstanding with settlement dates ranging from january through august gains and losses on forward exchange contracts that are used for hedges are accounted for on the balance sheet as inventory and an adjustment to equity  and are subsequently accounted for as part of the purchase price of the inventory upon execution of the contract 
at december   the unrealized gain on these outstanding forward contracts is approximately  net of taxes 
the company expects to continue to routinely enter into additional foreign exchange contracts throughout the year 
while the company believes that its current procedures with respect to the reduction of risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations are adequate  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company in the future 
inventory from contract manufacturers in the far east and brazil are purchased in united states dollars and the recent fluctuations of many of these currencies against the united states dollar has not had any material adverse impact on the company 
however  future purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturer  which may affect the company s cost of goods in the future 
the company does not believe the potential effects of such fluctuations would have a material adverse effect on the company 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that the relatively low rates of inflation experienced over the last few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not believe it has a material exposure to market risk 
the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risks with respect to its inventory transactions denominated in euro 
business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net dollar cash flows from transactions with foreign suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency rates 
the company manages these risks by utilizing foreign exchange contracts 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   the company had forward exchange contracts totaling with notional values million  which resulted in an unrealized gain of approximately  net of taxes 
the company s earnings may also be affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under its line of credit facility 
a two or less percentage point increase in interest rates effecting the company s credit facility would not have had a material effect on the company s and net income
