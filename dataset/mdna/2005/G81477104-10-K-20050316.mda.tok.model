as a result of the acquisition  we recorded intangible assets relating to customer lists and non competition clauses in the amount of million  which were amortized over periods ranging from fourteen to eighteen months 
amortization expense for fiscal and amounted to million and million  respectively 
in addition  we recorded goodwill in the amount of million representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually 
we performed an impairment test relating to goodwill arising from memestar acquisition and concluded there was no impairment as to the carrying value of the goodwill as of december  the purchase allocation for memestar acquisition is based on an appraisal performed by an independent appraisal firm in the united states 
immediately after the signing of the definitive agreement  we obtained effective control over memestar  accordingly  the operating results of memestar have been consolidated with our results starting january  in march  we completed the acquisition of crillion corporation  a british virgin islands limited liability corporation crillion  through a purchase of all of the outstanding shares of crillion 
as a result of such acquisition  crillion became a wholly owned subsidiary of sina 
crillion  through its subsidiary and exclusive contractual arrangement with a local entity in the prc  is engaged in the business of providing mvas in the prc 
the primary purposes of the acquisition were to enhance our mvas as well as increase our market share in the prc mvas market 
the aggregate purchase price is comprised of an initial consideration and two contingent considerations on achieving specified earnings in future periods 
the initial consideration of  is comprised of three elements a  in cash  b  newly issued sina ordinary shares  valued at  at the time of closing  delivered at the closing of the acquisition  and c approximately  in legal and professional fees related to the acquisition 
the two contingent considerations are based on crillion s financial performances in and the contingent considerations would be roughly to times of and earnings  provided that crillion s pretax net income for and is over million and million  respectively 
the total consideration is subject to a cap of million and will be in cash and in sina ordinary shares 
as of december   we estimated that the additional consideration related to the achievement of the performance target was approximately million  which was recorded as additional goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the acquisition  we recorded intangible assets relating to the customer lists  content provider contracts and non competition arrangements clauses in the amount of million  which were amortized over periods ranging from sixteen to thirty six months 
amortization expense related to intangible assets for fiscal amounted to million 
as of december   total goodwill recorded for the crillion acquisition was million  which included an initial million  representing the excess of the initial purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired  and the million for the achievement of the performance target 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment assessment 
we performed an impairment test relating to goodwill arising from crillion acquisition and concluded there was no impairment as to the carrying value of the goodwill as of december  the purchase price allocation for the crillion acquisition was based on an appraisal performed by an independent appraisal firm in the united states 
immediately after the closing of the acquisition  the operating results of crillion were consolidated with our operating results starting march  on july   we entered into an agreement to acquire davidhill capital inc  a british virgin islands limited liability corporation davidhill  and its uc instant messaging technology platform 
the closing of the acquisition occurred on october   but the operating results of davidhill have been consolidated with those of sina starting july   when we took over the effective control of davidhill 
the primary purpose of the acquisition was to leverage uc instant messaging technology platform to sina s long term web and wireless strategy 
davidhill owns the uc instant messaging 
table of contents technology platform and certain fixed assets the asset group via its wholly owned subsidiary in the prc 
we acquired the asset group through a purchase of all of the outstanding shares of davidhill 
we considered eitf  determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business  and concluded that the asset group constitutes a business 
we therefore applied sfas no 
 business combinations  to account for the acquisition of davidhill 
as a result of such acquisition  davidhill became one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the aggregate purchase price is comprised of an initial consideration and a contingent consideration on achieving specified performances in future periods 
the initial consideration of  is comprised of three elements a  in cash  b  newly issued sina ordinary shares  valued at  in accordance with the average of per share closing prices of sina ordinary shares on the nasdaq national market during the thirty calendar days immediately preceding july   delivered at the closing of the acquisition  and b approximately  in legal and professional fees related to the acquisition 
the contingent consideration of the davidhill acquisition is based on certain simultaneous online user targets being reached by davidhill in the months after the agreement date 
the contingent consideration is subject to a cap of million and will be in cash and in sina ordinary shares 
as a result of the acquisition  we recorded intangible assets relating to technology and non competition arrangements in the amount of million  which were amortized over periods ranging from twenty seven months to ten years months 
amortization expense of related intangible assets for fiscal amounted to million 
goodwill of million was recorded representing the excess of the initial purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the contingent consideration  if any  will be recorded as additional goodwill 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at initial valuation and annually thereafter 
the purchase price allocation and initial valuation of goodwill for the davidhill acquisition was based on an appraisal performed by an independent appraisal firm in the united states in september davidhill and its subsidiary have not commenced generating any revenue from the uc instant messaging services 
see further discussion on the acquisitions of memestar  crillion and davidhill in note in notes to consolidated financial statements in item financing we had incurred net losses through september  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily using the net proceeds raised through the sale of preference shares prior to our initial public offering and the sale of our ordinary shares in the initial public offering 
since we became profitable  we have also financed our operations using our net income from operations 
we raised additional financing by issuing zero coupon convertible subordinated notes in july we will continue our investment in the development and enhancement of our products  content and services  as well as investment in sales and marketing 
if we are unable to generate sufficient net income from our operations in the future  we may have to finance our operations from the current funds available 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  employee benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition policies advertising advertising revenues are derived principally from online advertising and sponsorship arrangements 
online advertising arrangements allow advertisers to place advertisements on particular areas of our web sites  in particular formats and over particular periods of time 
advertising revenues from online advertising arrangements are recognized ratably over the displayed period of the contract when the collectibility is reasonably assured 
sponsorship arrangements allow advertisers to sponsor a particular area on our web sites in exchange for a fixed payment over the contract period 
advertising revenues are recognized ratably over the period of sponsorship 
advertising revenues derived from the design  coordination and integration of online advertising and sponsorship arrangements to be placed on our web sites are recognized ratably over the term of such programs 
in accordance with eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  advertising arrangements involving multiple deliverables are broken down into single element arrangements based on relative fair value for revenue recognition purpose 
we recognize revenue on the elements delivered and defer the recognition of revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements until the remaining obligations have been satisfied 
revenues from barter transactions are recognized during the period in which the advertisements are displayed on our properties 
barter transactions are recorded at the lower of the fair value of the goods and services received or the fair value of the advertisement given  provided the fair value of the transaction is reliably measurable 
revenues from barter transactions were minimal for all periods presented 
non advertising non advertising revenues are mainly derived from mvas  fee based services  e commerce and enterprise services 
mvas 
mvas revenues are derived principally from providing mobile phone users with sms  mms  wap and ivr services 
these services include news and other content subscriptions  mobile dating service  picture and logo download  ring tones  ring back tones  mobile games  chat rooms and access to music files 
revenues from mvas are charged on a monthly or per usage basis 
such revenues are recognized in the period in which the service is performed  provided that no significant company obligations remain  collection of the receivables is reasonably assured and the amounts can be accurately estimated 
we contract with third party mobile operators for billing and transmission services related to the mvas transmitted to our users 
in accordance with eitf  revenues are recorded on a gross basis when we are considered the primary obligor to the mvas users 
under the gross method  the amount billed to mvas users are recognized as revenues and the fees charged or retained by the third party mobile operators are recognized as cost of revenues 
revenues on mvas where we are not considered the primary obligor to the user are recorded on a net basis 
under the net method  revenues are recorded net of fees charged or retained by the third party mobile operators 
due to the time lag of receiving billing statements from third party mobile operators  mvas revenues are estimated based on our internal records of billings and transmissions for the month  adjusting for prior period confirmation rates with mobile operators and prior period discrepancies between internally estimated revenues and actual revenues confirmed by mobile operators 
prior period confirmation rate applies to the estimation of revenue is determined at the lower of the latest confirmation rate available and the average of six months historical rates available  given that we have obtained six months of confirmation rates 
historically  there have been no significant true up adjustments to the estimates 
to the extent that such revenues cannot be accurately estimated  we rely on the billing statements from the mobile operators to record revenues 
historically  due to the time lag of mobile operator billing statements and lack of adequate information to make estimates  we adopted the one month lag reporting policy for our mvas revenues described above 
this policy has been applied on a consistent basis but does not apply to mvas revenues from acquired entities memestar and crillion 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded million  million and million of revenues from our mvas  respectively 
if we had not used the one month lag reporting policy  our revenues from mvas for those periods would have been million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents we purchase certain content from third party content providers for our mvas 
most of these arrangements state that the fees payable to the third party content providers are calculated based on certain percentages of the revenue earned by their content after deducting the fees paid to third party mobile operators 
our mvas revenue is inclusive of such fees since we act as the principal in these arrangements by having the ability to determine the fees charged to end users and being the primary obligor to the end users with respect to providing such services 
fee based services 
fee based services allow our users to subscribe for services on our web sites including online games  virtual isp and paid email services 
revenues from these services are recognized in the period in which the service is performed  provided that no significant company obligations remain  collection of the receivables is reasonably assured and the amounts can be accurately estimated 
e commerce 
e commerce revenues are derived principally from slotting fees charged to merchants for selective positioning and promoting their goods or services within our online mall  sinamall  and from commissions calculated as a percentage of the online sales transaction value of the merchants 
slotting fee revenue is recognized ratably over the period the products are shown on our web site while the commission revenue is recognized on a net basis after both successful online verification of customers credit cards and shipment of products 
product returns have not been significant and are assumed by vendors 
enterprise services 
enterprise services mainly include paid search and directory listings  corporate emails  classified listings and enterprise e solutions 
revenues are recognized in the period in which the service is performed  provided that no significant company obligations remain  collection of the receivables is reasonably assured and the amounts can be accurately estimated 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  the recognition of these revenues is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
allowances for doubtful accounts we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based on actual bad debt rate in the prior year and other factors 
we also provide specific provisions for bad debts when facts and circumstances indicate that the receivable is unlikely to be collected  including an assessment of all receivables over days 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
consolidation of variable interest entities we have adopted fasb interpretation no 
r fin r consolidation of variable interest entities vies  an interpretation of arb no 

fin r requires a vie to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns

available for sale securities investments investments classified as available for sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains losses  if any  recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
realized gains or losses are charged to income 
table of contents statement during the period in which the gain or loss is realized 
if we determine a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security shall be written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down will be accounted for a realized loss 
the new cost basis will not be changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
determination of whether declines in value are other than temporary requires significant judgment 
subsequent increases and decreases in the fair value of available for sale securities will be included in comprehensive income through a credit or charge to shareholders equity  except for an other than temporary impairment which will be charged to income statement 
investments classified as available for sales securities include marketable equity securities of sun media group and marketable debt securities 
we invest in marketable debt securities with the intent to make such funds readily available for operating or acquisition purposes and  accordingly  classify them as short term investments 
business combinations we account for our business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires that the acquisition cost to be allocated to the assets and liabilities we acquired based on their fair values 
we make estimates and judgments in determining the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities  based on independent appraisal reports  for material purchases  as well as our experience with similar assets and liabilities in the similar industries 
if different judgments or assumptions were used  the amounts assigned to the individual acquired assets or liabilities could be materially different 
we apply the criteria specified in eitf determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business 
to determine whether acquired asset groups constitute a business 
goodwill and intangible assets  net goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of our acquisitions of interests in its subsidiaries and variable interest entities 
we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on january  under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized  but tested for impairment upon first adoption and annually thereafter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired 
we assess goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas we apply the criteria specified in sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas to determine whether an intangible asset should be recognized separately from goodwill 
intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions are recognized as assets separate from goodwill if they satisfy either the contractual legal or separability criterion 
per sfas  intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  trademark  customer list  user base and non compete agreements  arising from the acquisitions of subsidiaries and variable interest entities are recognized and measured at fair value upon acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives from one to ten years 
we review the amortization methods and estimated useful lives of intangible assets regularly 
the recoverability of an intangible to be held and used is evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the intangible to its future net undiscounted cash flows 
if the intangible is considered to be impaired  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the intangible exceeds the fair value of the intangible calculated using a discounted future cash flow analysis 
we use estimates and judgments in its impairment tests and if different estimates or judgments had been utilized  the timing or the amount of the impairment charges could be different 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  if any  based on our estimates of our future taxable income as well as our tax planning strategies when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we are able to utilize more of our deferred tax assets than the net amount previously recorded when unanticipated events occur  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase our net income when those events occur 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and net revenues years ended december  unaudited of change in thousands  except percentages yoy yoy net revenues advertising non advertising mvas other non advertising total net revenues total net revenues increased from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to growth in mvas 
mvas contributed to  and of fiscal  and of total net revenues  respectively 
the increases in revenues from mvas were primarily driven by the growth of mvas market in china and our acquisitions of memestar in january and crillion in march advertising 
advertising revenues grew from fiscal to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the growth of online advertising spending in the prc market  as more advertisers began to accept the internet as a medium for advertisement 
for fiscal  advertising revenues from china accounted for of our total advertising revenues  compared to and of our total advertising revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
the number of advertising customers in china was approximately for the year ended december   as compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
average revenues per advertising customer in china were  for fiscal  as compared to  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
non advertising 
non advertising grew from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal the increases were primarily driven by the growth of our mvas revenues in china  which represent of our total non advertising revenues in fiscal  as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
mvas mvas revenues grew from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to the growth came primarily from our china market from the introduction of new products and the acquisitions of memestar in january and crillion in march mvas revenues generated by memestar were million for both fiscal and mvas revenues generated by crillion in fiscal were approximately million 
years ended december  unaudited of change in thousands  except percentages yoy yoy sms mms  wap and others ivr total our sms revenues increased from fiscal to fiscal  primarily driven by market growth  the crillion acquisition  as well as increase in promotional efforts for usage based sms products 
sms revenues grew from fiscal to fiscal  mostly due to market growth and the memestar acquisition 
sms accounted for of mvas revenues in fiscal and in fiscal changes in the regulatory environment and mobile operators policies including the transition onto a new sms billing platform by china mobile  have been impacting our sms revenues since the third quarter 
table of contents of fiscal during the middle of  mobile operators started transitioning sms providers to a new billing platform 
as of december   fourteen provinces have been moved onto china mobile s new billing platform 
in the first half of  we will be required to switch the remaining provinces to the new billing platform 
starting in march  china mobile is expected to transition mms to the new billing platform and our mms will be subject to this change 
we have been monitoring the extent of the impact of the new billing platforms to our business and to our current revenue recognition policy 
these new billing platforms have resulted in added operational controls and procedures in areas such as customer subscription and customer billing  and correspondingly  increased the difficulties for new user recruitment and failure rate for fee collection from our users 
in general  the new billing platforms have had significant negative impact on our sms revenues although we were not able to quantify such impact 
in the past  china mobile allowed mvas providers to sign service agreement with any one of its provincial subsidiaries for providing nation wide service and for bill collection 
starting january  china mobile requires service agreement to be signed with and new product application to be approved by each individual province 
this increases the difficulty and length of time to launch new products which may adversely impact our mvas revenue growth 
also  certain provincial operators who historically have acted as an agent in advancing payments for other provincial operators instituted a new procedure that requires the fees to be reconciled with the respective provinces before payments are made 
this new procedure may delay our receivables collection from mobile operators in the future 
in january  the chinese state administration of radio  film and television sarft  which regulates radio and television stations in china  issued a notice prohibiting commercials for mvas related to fortune telling from airing on radio and television stations effective in february this notice could also lead to further actions by other chinese government authorities to prohibit the sale of such fortune telling related sms which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
sarft or other chinese government authorities may prohibit the marketing of other mvas via a channel we depend on to generate revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
revenues from g mms and wap and other products grew  from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal starting in january  china mobile stopped its mms album service 
mms album allows users to receive their subscribed mms messages from china mobile s website when the subscribed mms messages could not be successfully delivered to their mobile phones 
with the termination of such service  we are no longer able to collect fees from users when the mms messages could not be delivered to the users mobile phones 
as a result  our mms revenue suffered significant decline in january and we will have to grow our mms revenue from a lower base going forward 
mms revenues accounted for approximately of our total mvas revenues for the three months ended december  in addition  in march china mobile will start to migrate mms onto a new billing platform and our mms revenue may decline further due to such migration

in accordance with eitf  revenues are recorded on a gross basis when we are considered the primary obligor to the mvas users 
under the gross method  the amount billed to mvas users are recognized as revenues and the fees charged or retained by the third party mobile operators are recognized as cost of revenues 
revenues on mvas where we are not considered the primary obligor to the user are recorded on a net basis 
under the net method  revenues are recorded net of fees charged or retained by the third party mobile operators 
if we were to enter into new arrangements with mobile operators or mobile operators were to request us to change the existing arrangements that cause us to no longer be the primary obligor to the users  we would have to record our mvas revenues on a net basis 
consequently  this would cause a significant decline in our net revenues  but should not have significant impact on our gross margin 
for the year  of our mvas revenues were recorded on a gross basis 
substantially all of our revenue growth from mvas in the second half of fiscal came from the growth in sms and mms 
with the developments described above  we may experience significant decline in mvas revenues in during the third quarter of fiscal  our ivr service was temporarily suspended by china mobile due to the violation of certain operating procedures 
on october   our ivr service was resumed by china mobile 
however  we do not expect to generate significant revenues from ivr service in near future  as resumed services usually take times to ramp up

excluding these one time content purchases  gross profit margin for advertising revenues for fiscal would have been 
the year to year increases in advertising gross profit margins from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal were primarily due to the increase in advertising revenues without proportionally increasing the costs of web site production 
although certain web site production expenses have stayed relatively flat in proportion to the growth of advertising revenues  we may have to increase our investments in these areas to maintain our competitiveness  causing future results to be materially different from historical trends 
non advertising 
gross profit margin for non advertising revenues for fiscal was relatively flat compared to that for fiscal  as the majority of the costs associated with non advertising revenues are variable costs 
the increase of our gross margins for non advertising revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the increase in revenues from monthly subscription services of our self developed products  which have higher gross margins

the year to year decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the rapid growth of revenues 
as a result of factors such as the ban on promoting certain sms products via direct advertising on radio and television  the uncertainty of marketing new sms products via direct advertising on radio and television and the potential introduction of new mvas business models with mobile operators discussed above  historical sales and marketing expense trends may not be representative of actual results in the future 
product development expenses product development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses incurred for enhancement to and maintenance of our web sites as well as costs associated with new product development such as email  search  instant messaging  casual games and new mvas products

our general and administrative expenses also include expenses relating to the transfer of the economic benefits generated from our vies in the prc to our subsidiaries

stock based compensation expenses deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the exercise price of options granted and the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
deferred stock compensation is amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the applicable options  which is generally four years

because the revenue and the gross margin of techur did not grow as expected  our management reassessed the carrying value of the intangible assets and concluded that there would not be significant future income generated from these customer relationships 
the carrying value of the intangible assets of million was therefore written off during the second quarter of fiscal due to the permanent impairment of value 
interest income interest income was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income from fiscal to fiscal was due to higher balance of cash and cash equivalent and short term investments generated from our operation and the issuance of convertible notes in july despite higher balance of cash and cash equivalent and short term investments from fiscal to fiscal  interest income did not increase due to lower interest rate

our prc operations are conducted through various subsidiaries and vies 
pursuant to the prc income tax laws  our subsidiaries and vies are generally subject to enterprise income taxes eit at a statutory rate of  consisting of a national income tax and a local income tax 
however  some of our subsidiaries and vies qualify as new technology enterprises and  under prc income tax laws  are subject to a preferential tax rate of 
in addition  some of our subsidiaries are foreign investment enterprises  and under prc income tax laws  they are entitled to either a three year tax exemption followed by three years with a reduction in the tax rate  commencing from the first operating year  or a two year tax exemption followed by three years with a reduction in the tax rate  commencing from the first profitable year 
to the extent that our vies have undistributed after tax net income  we have to pay tax on behalf of the employees when we try to distribute the dividend from these local entities in the future 
the dividend tax rate is 
we expect that based on our current operating and tax structure in the prc  our overall effective income tax rates will be approximately to for fiscal and  respectively 
such expected effectives rates are subject to change at any time if chinese tax authorities challenge us on our tax arrangements between our subsidiaries and vies 
we are in the process of applying for new preferential tax treatments for certain subsidiaries and vies in the prc 
if these applications are approved  our projected effective tax rates will be further reduced 
there is no assurance that such tax treatments will be approved 
over the longer term  if the chinese government phases out preferential tax treatment for foreign investment enterprises or for new technology enterprises  our effective tax rates can be increased to as high as 
due to our operating and tax structures in the prc  we have entered into technical and other service agreements between our subsidiaries and our vies in the prc  pursuant to which our subsidiaries provide technical and other services to our vies in exchange for substantially all net income of these vies 
we incur a business tax when our subsidiaries receive the fees from the vies  which we include in our operating expenses as cost of transferring economic benefit generated from these vies 
we believe that the terms of such service agreements are in compliance with the laws in the prc 
some of these agreements were reviewed by the tax authorities in the prc in the past and no comments were raised 
however  due to the uncertainties surrounding the interpretation of the tax transfer pricing rules relating to related party transactions in the prc  it is possible that tax authorities in the prc might challenge the transfer prices that we used for the related party transactions among our entities in the prc in the future 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our recent operations and capital expenditures primarily using the net proceeds of million raised through the sale of preference shares  million raised from the sale of ordinary shares in the initial public offering and million raised from the sale of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes in july  as well as net income from our operations 

table of contents on july   we sold million aggregate amount of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes the notes due in a private offering  which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the notes were issued at par and bear no interest 
the notes will be convertible into our ordinary shares  upon satisfaction of certain conditions  at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustments for certain events 
upon conversion  we have the right to deliver cash in lieu of ordinary shares  or a combination of cash and ordinary shares 
we may redeem for cash all or part of the notes on or after july   at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes 
the purchasers may require us to repurchase all or part of the notes for cash on july annually from through  and on july   and upon a change of control  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes 
we filed a registration statement on form s for the resale of the notes and the ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of the notes 
the sec has declared the registration statement to be effective 
one of the conditions for conversion of the notes to sina ordinary shares is that the sale price defined as closing per share sales price of sina ordinary shares reaches a specified threshold for a defined period of time 
the specified thresholds are i during the period from issuance to july   if the sale price of sina ordinary shares  for each of any five consecutive trading days in the immediately preceding fiscal quarter  exceeds of the conversion price per ordinary share  and ii during the period from july  to july   if the sale price of sina ordinary shares on the previous trading day is more than of the conversion price per ordinary share 
for the quarter ended december   the sale price of sina ordinary shares exceeded of the conversion price per ordinary share for five consecutive trading days 
the notes are therefore convertible into sina ordinary shares according to the threshold i described above 
as of december   we did not receive any request for conversion of the notes to sina ordinary shares 
upon a purchaser s election to convert the notes in the future periods  we have the right to deliver cash in lieu of ordinary shares  or a combination of cash and ordinary shares 
we have also entered into various lease agreements for our office premises in china  the united states of america  hong kong and taiwan

we are obligated to pay additional consideration on our acquisition of crillion 
total consideration related to performance achievement was estimated at million  as of december   payable in cash and the other in sina ordinary shares 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments to meet the future requirements of our operating activities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures and other obligations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may sell additional equities or obtain credit facilities to enhance our liquidity position or to increase our cash reserve for future acquisitions 
the sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our shareholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in our three months ending september  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r  and we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas in september  the eitf issue no

eitf was issued stating that contingently convertible debt should be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
this issue is effective for reporting periods ending after december  we adopted eitf in the three months ended december  and applied retroactively to all prior periods

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and security market risk our investment policy limits our investments of excess cash to government or quasi government securities and in high quality corporate securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
due to the fact that a majority of our investments are in short term instruments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure in this area 
as of december  we had unrealized losses of million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity 
our convertible notes issued in july in the amount of million bear no interest and are denominated in us dollars and therefore there is no interest or foreign currency exchange risk associated with the outstanding convertible notes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our revenues derived and expenses and liabilities incurred are in chinese renminbi with a relatively small amount in taiwan dollars  hong kong dollars and us dollars 
thus  our revenues and operating results may be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations in the currencies of china  taiwan and hong kong 
see risk factors currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency exchange may adversely affect our business  including limiting our ability to convert chinese renminbi into foreign currencies and  if renminbi were to decline in value  reducing our revenue in us dollar terms 
we have not tried to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by using hedging transactions 
however  we may choose to do so in the future 
we may not be able to do this successfully 
accordingly  we may experience economic losses and negative impacts on earnings and equity as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuation during the year ended december  was not material to us
