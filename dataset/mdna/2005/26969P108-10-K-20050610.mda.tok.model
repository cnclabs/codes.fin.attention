item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary strong residential construction and a recovering commercial construction demand in all of our markets helped to set record fiscal sales volume  revenues and earnings per share 
demand in all of our markets was strong as we reported increased sales volume in each of our segments for the fiscal year ended march  the majority of our earnings improvement was in the gypsum wallboard and cement operations 
fiscal revenues increased to million  net earnings were up to million and diluted earnings per share were up to 
gypsum wallboard sales volume was up and represented record volumes for the company due to record industry demand while operating earnings increased due to a increase in average sales price 
fiscal was the th consecutive sold out year for our cement operations 
cement sales volume increased  and operating earnings increased from last year due to higher average net sales prices offset primarily by the impact of increased purchased cement volumes and costs 
paperboard reported record sales volume and operating earnings due to increased shipments to our wallboard operations and higher net sales prices 
concrete and aggregates operating earnings improved over last fiscal year due primarily to a record sales volume increase in aggregates of 
corporate expenses increased million due primarily to the cost associated with consulting services and the implementation costs of sarbanes oxley 
manufacturing costs in fiscal were negatively impacted by increased natural gas  coal  power  paper fiber and maintenance costs 
demand for energy related products continued at a high level and prices for these products are expected to increase further in fiscal maintenance costs are expected to remain flat in fiscal we operate in cyclical businesses 
downturns in overall economic activity usually have a significant adverse effect on cyclical businesses due to decreased demand and reduced pricing 
recently  wallboard demand has been favorably impacted by strong residential construction due to low interest rates 
rising interest rates could bring an erosion in new residential construction activity 
however  commercial and industrial activity  which are showing signs of improvement  may help to offset reduced demand in the residential construction sector if interest rates increase 
cement demand continues to be positively impacted by a strong national highway funding program 
the funds to be allocated in the current re authorization proposals in congress exceed the prior highway funding program 
strong demand from new housing and residential remodeling resulted in record wallboard consumption for calendar according to the gypsum association  national wallboard consumption of billion square feet for calendar  the highest level on record  was up from last year s consumption 
industry utilization rates have been at the level  resulting in a increase in wallboard pricing for fy we implemented a price increase in april and another price increase was announced in may to be implemented in july us cement consumption continues to be strong 
total us cement shipments of million short tons for calendar were above calendar cement imports for calendar were million short tons  above last year s imports 
the us cement industry has been sold out for the last years as a result of a domestic capacity deficit 
current us demand requires imports of over to supplement domestic capacity 
the us cement industry is anticipating a tight supply of imported cement this year due to high freight rates and increasing consumption in world markets 
cement pricing has increased over prior year reversing a slight decline over the past three years 
we implemented price increases in certain markets in january and all markets in april our recycled paperboard mill continued operational and marketing improvements and is now producing at above its original design capacity 

table of contents the company conducts one of its cement operations through a joint venture  texas lehigh cement company lp  which is located in buda  texas the joint venture 
the company owns a interest in the joint venture and accounts for its interest under the equity method of accounting 
however  for purposes of the cement segment information presented  the company proportionately consolidates its share of the cement joint venture s revenues and operating earnings  which is the way management organizes the segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
see note g of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional segment information 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated results 
consolidated net revenues for fiscal were up from fiscal driven by higher sales prices and volumes in all segments  especially gypsum wallboard and cement 
fiscal operating earnings of million were up from million last fiscal year mainly due to increased gypsum wallboard and cement operating earnings

corporate overhead 
corporate general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million compared to million for last fiscal year 
the increase was primarily the result of increased consulting expenses  higher compensation and benefit costs and costs associated with sarbanes oxley  partially offset by the absence of million in direct expenses related to the spin off transaction included in fiscal other income 
other income consists of a variety of items that are non segment operating in nature and includes clinker sales income  non inventoried aggregates income  gypsum wallboard distribution center income  asset sales and other miscellaneous income and cost items 
net interest expense 
net interest expense of million for fiscal declined million from fiscal due to lower debt balances and reduced borrowing costs 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal declined to from primarily due to legal  advisory and consultant costs incurred in fiscal related to the spin off transaction which were not deductible for tax purposes and  a current year state tax benefit of million as a result of a lower effective state tax rate applied to our anticipated state deferred tax balances 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing  pre tax earnings of million were above fiscal pre tax earnings of million

revenues price increases throughout the year and record company wallboard shipments positively impacted revenues for fiscal as compared to prior year 
pricing has continued to strengthen as a result of record demand resulting in the near full capacity utilization of the us wallboard industry 
our sales volume of  mmsf represents a record for the company 
operating margins cost of sales were impacted by increasing transportation costs  natural gas and paper costs 
on a per unit basis  freight costs  which are deducted to determine average net sales price  have increased compared to fiscal operating earnings represented the second highest earnings in company history 
outlook strong demand from new housing resulted in record wallboard consumption for calendar according to the gypsum association  calendar national wallboard consumption of billion square feet was up from last year s same period 
throughout fiscal industry utilization rates have trended upward in excess of and as a result  pricing has firmed up in all of the markets we serve 
we implemented a price increase in late april in all of the markets we serve and another price increase was announced in may to be implemented in july of wallboard pricing  however  has historically softened during the winter season due to lower levels of construction activity

additionally  fiscal sales volume was a record high due to high levels of construction activity and favorable weather conditions in our markets 
the tight supply of cement in these markets has resulted in sold out conditions at all of our plants for fiscal operating margins we continue to utilize purchased cement to supplement our production capacities in certain markets that we serve 
purchased cement tons were  tons in fiscal versus  tons in the prior year and impacted current year average cost per ton by per ton 
fuel and power costs have increased over the prior year period due primarily to increased cost of petroleum coke and coal 
outlook us cement consumption remains strong as a result of strong housing activity  a recovering commercial construction market and federal and state infrastructure projects 
in the near term  we expect us cement pricing to remain stable or increase due to strong domestic consumption  increasing world consumption and high international freight costs for imported cement 
total us shipments of million short tons for calendar  were above the same period in calendar cement imports for calendar  were million short tons or above last year s imports 
the company has been sold out for the last years and it is estimated that current industry wide domestic production capacity is short of domestic consumption 

table of contents paperboard operations for the fiscal year ended march  percentage change dollars in thousands gross revenues  including intersegment freight and delivery costs billed to customers net revenues sales volume m tons average net sales price unit production costs operating margin operating earnings revenues paperboard achieved price increases in each of the products it sells  primarily as a result of previously established contract escalators associated with the price of the waste paper 
paperboard sales to our wallboard division were thousand tons at million compared to thousand tons at million for last year 
operating margins cost of sales per ton was impacted primarily by higher recovered fiber costs of per ton  higher fuel costs of per ton  higher chemical costs of per ton and higher inbound freight costs of per ton  offset positively by the mix of products sold and lower returns and allowances 
outlook as a result of strong market demand  capital improvements and improved operating efficiency  our paperboard mill is currently producing at of its original design capacity 
while we anticipate continued strong demand for our products over the next twelve months 
however  announced recycled container board production expansion could place upward price pressure on recovered fiber as supply tightens 

table of contents concrete operations for the fiscal year ended march  percentage change dollars in thousands gross revenues  including intersegment sales volume m yards average net sales price unit production costs operating margin operating earnings revenues concrete revenues were impacted primarily by increased average sales prices of per cubic yard in the northern california market and per cubic yard in the austin  texas market versus the prior year  offset by decreased volumes in the northern california market 
operating margins concrete margins were negatively impacted by increased raw materials cement and aggregates and delivery costs 
in both of our markets the majority of such costs were passed through to customers via price increases reflected above 
outlook while concrete pricing in the austin  texas market has increased slightly  pricing remains below the national average and well below pricing in the northern california market 
we expect this trend to continue for the next twelve months 
additionally  we expect continued stable pricing in the northern california market 

table of contents aggregates operations for the fiscal year ended march  percentage change dollars in thousands gross revenues  including intersegment freight and delivery costs billed to customers net revenues sales volume m tons average net sales price unit production costs operating margin operating earnings revenues we recorded record volumes throughout fiscal  driven by the northern california market where demand continues to outpace supply 
pricing continued to strengthen in northern california and is up as compared to the prior year 
aggregates volumes for the austin  texas market have increased versus the prior year period due to higher sales of road base 
sales of road base are at lower prices than washed aggregates products and therefore negatively impacted the average texas sales price of aggregates by versus the prior year 
operating margins costs were impacted negatively by higher contract mining costs and higher maintenance costs versus last year 
aggregates costs per ton have remained essentially flat due to fixed costs being spread over larger sales volumes 
outlook we expect that aggregates pricing in the northern california area will continue to strengthen due primarily to demand outpacing capacity 
aggregates pricing in the austin  texas market is anticipated to increase moderately over the next twelve months due to increased levels of construction activity in the austin area and a changing mix in the products sold

gypsum wallboard revenues were greater than fiscal revenues due to increased sales volume 
the operating earnings gain resulted from higher sales volume and lower cost of sales  partially offset by a slight decrease in sales prices 
sales volume of  million square feet mmsf for fiscal was greater than  mmsf sold during fiscal the sales volume increase resulted from record industry demand and the company operating at a higher average utilization rate in fiscal compared to fiscal pricing increased from its low point of per msf at the end of fiscal to approximately per msf at the end of fiscal cost of sales per msf was impacted by the positive impact on fixed costs from the increase in production volume  partially offset by higher natural gas and paper costs

purchased cement sales volume of  tons was greater than fiscal sales volume 
demand continued to be strong in all of the company s cement markets as fiscal was another sold out year 
lower average cement net sales price of per ton for fiscal was lower than per ton for fiscal due to competitive price pressures in the illinois and mountain states markets 
cost of sales per ton for fiscal increased over fiscal due to higher maintenance  employee benefits and energy costs

table of contents critical accounting policies certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
although our accounting policies are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policies and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
these evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
goodwill 
pursuant to sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we have elected to test for goodwill impairment in the first quarter of each calendar year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenues and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining a implied fair value of goodwill 
similar to the review for impairment of other long lived assets  evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
environmental liabilities 
our operations are subject to state  federal and local environmental laws and regulations  which impose liability for cleanup or remediation of environmental pollution and hazardous waste arising from past acts and require pollution control and prevention  site restoration and operating permits and or approvals to conduct certain of its operations 
we record environmental accruals when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
environmental remediation accruals are based on internal studies and estimates  including shared financial liability with third parties 
environmental expenditures that extend the life  increase the capacity  improve the safety or efficiency of assets or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized 
other environmental costs are expensed when incurred 
valuation of accounts receivable 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances when we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to the company  the balance in the reserve for doubtful accounts is evaluated  and if determined to be deficient  a specific amount will be added to the reserve 
for all other customers  the reserve for doubtful accounts is determined by the length of time the receivables are past due or the status of the customer s financial condition

in addition  changes in working capital items such as increases in accounts payable offset by the increase in accounts receivable contributed to the increase in cash flows from operating activities 
working capital at march  was million compared to million at march  the increase resulted primarily from a million increase in cash  million increase in inventories  a million increase in accounts and notes receivable  offset against a million increase in notes payable  and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
total debt increased from million at march   to at march  debt to capitalization at march   was compared to at march  based on our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended march   along with the projected net earnings for fiscal  we believe that our internally generated cash flow coupled with funds available under various credit facilities will enable us to provide adequately for our current operations  dividends  capital expenditures and future growth through the end of fiscal the company was in compliance at march  and during the fiscal year ended march   with all the terms and covenants of its credit agreements and expects to be in compliance during the next months 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at march   compared to million at march  debt financing activities 
on december  we amended our existing credit facility to increase the facility amount from million to million the new credit facility  modified certain financial and other covenants and extended the maturity date to the new credit facility expires on december   at which time all borrowings outstanding are due 
the borrowings under the new credit facility are guaranteed by all 
table of contents major operating subsidiaries of the company 
at the option of the company  outstanding principal amounts on the new credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to i libor  plus an agreed margin ranging from to basis points  which is to be established quarterly based upon the company s ratio of consolidated ebitda to its consolidated indebtedness  or ii an alternate base rate which is the higher of a the prime rate or b the federal funds rate plus per annum  plus an agreed margin ranging from to basis points 
interest payments are payable monthly or at the end of the libor advance periods  which can be up to a period of six months at the option of the company 
under the new credit facility  we are required to adhere to a number of financial and other covenants  including covenants relating to the company s interest coverage ratio and consolidated funded indebtedness ratio 
at march  the company had million of borrowings available under the new credit facility 
our million trade receivables securitization facility the receivables securitization facility  was funded through the issuance of commercial paper and backed by a day committed bank liquidity arrangement 
the receivables securitization facility has a termination date of february   subject to a day bank commitment 
the receivables securitization facility has been fully consolidated on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
subsidiary company receivables are sold on a revolving basis first to the company and then to a wholly owned special purpose bankruptcy remote entity of the company 
this entity pledges the receivables as security for advances under the facility 
initially  the borrowed funds have been used to pay down borrowings under the credit facility 
outstanding principal amounts under the receivables securitization facility bear interest at the commercial paper rate plus a facility fee 
under the receivables securitization facility  we are required to adhere to certain financial and other covenants that are similar to those in the new credit facility 
the company had million of borrowings outstanding at march  under the receivables securitization facility 
other than the receivables securitization facility and the new credit facility  the company has no other source of committed external financing in place 
in the event the receivables securitization facility is terminated  funds should be available under the new credit facility to repay borrowings 
however  if the new credit facility were terminated  no assurance can be given as to the company s ability to secure a new source of financing 
consequently  if a balance is outstanding on the new credit facility at the time of termination  and an alternative source of financing cannot be secured  it would have a material adverse impact on the company 
none of the company s debt is rated by the rating agencies 
we do not have any off balance sheet debt except for operating leases 
other than the receivables securitization facility  we do not have any other transactions  arrangements or relationships with special purpose entities

see table under item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities on page on july   we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares of common stock  raising our repurchase authorization to approximately  shares 
as of march   we had remaining authorization to purchase  shares 
share repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and amount of any repurchases of shares will be determined by the company s management  based on 
table of contents its evaluation of market and economic conditions and other factors 
the repurchase authorization applies to both classes of the company s common stock 
dividends 
dividends paid in fiscal years and were million and million  respectively 
on january   in conjunction with the spin off from centex  the company paid a per share or approximately million special dividend 
each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our board of directors  and we intend to evaluate our dividend payment amount on an ongoing basis 
capital expenditures 
the following table compares capital expenditures for the years ended ended march  dollars in thousands land and quarries plants buildings  machinery and equipment total capital expenditures for fiscal  we expect expenditures of the following approximately million million higher than our levels  with the year over year increase due primarily to the expansion of illinois cement 
historically  we have financed such expenditures with cash from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
contractual obligations 
the company has certain contractual obligations covering manufacturing  transportation and certain other facilities and equipment 
future payments due  aggregated by type of contractual obligation are set forth as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands contractual obligations long term debt note payable operating leases purchase obligations total purchase obligations are non cancelable agreements to purchase coal and natural gas  to pay royalty amounts and capital expenditure commitments 
based on our current estimates  we will not make any additional contributions to our defined benefit plans for fiscal year stock repurchase program 
see table under item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities on pages and 
table of contents inflation and changing prices inflation has become less of a factor in the us economy as the rate of increase has moderated during the last several years 
the consumer price index rose approximately in calendar  in  and in prices of materials and services  with the exception of power  natural gas  coal  coke  and transportation freight have remained relatively stable over the three year period 
strict cost control and improving productivity also minimize the impact of inflation 
the ability to recover increasing costs by obtaining higher sales prices varies with the level of activity in the construction industry  the number  size  and strength of competitors and the availability of products to supply a local market 
general outlook see outlook within item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on pages recent accounting pronouncements see footnote a to the consolidated financial statements on page forward looking statements certain sections of this report including management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  section e of the securities exchange act of and the private litigation reform act of forward looking statements may be identified by the context of the statement and generally arise when the company is discussing its beliefs  estimates or expectations 
these statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the company s actual results to be materially different from planned or expected results 
those risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to levels of construction spending 
demand for our products is directly related to the level of activity in the construction industry  which includes residential  commercial and infrastructure construction 
furthermore  activity in the infrastructure construction business is directly related to the amount of government funding available for such projects 
any decrease in the amount of government funds available for such projects or any decrease in construction activity in general could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
interest rates 
our business is significantly affected by the movement of interest rates 
interest rates have a direct impact on the level of residential  commercial and infrastructure construction activity put in place 
higher interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  increases in interest rates could result in higher interest expense related to borrowings under our credit facilities 
price fluctuations and supply demand for our products 
the products sold by us are commodities and competition among manufacturers is based largely on price 
prices are often subject to material changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand  general economic conditions and other market conditions beyond our control 
increases in the production capacity for products such as gypsum wallboard may create an oversupply of such products and negatively impact product prices 
there can be no assurance that prices for products sold by us will not decline in the future or that such declines will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
significant changes in the cost of  and the availability of  fuel  energy and other raw materials 
significant increases in the cost of fuel  energy or raw materials used in connection with our businesses or substantial decreases in their availability could materially and adversely affect our 
table of contents sales and operating profits 
major cost components in each of our businesses are the cost of fuel  energy and raw materials 
prices for fuel  energy or raw materials used in connection with our businesses could change significantly in a short period of time for reasons outside our control 
prices for natural gas and electrical power  which are significant components of the costs associated with our gypsum wallboard and cement businesses  have increased significantly in recent years and are expected to increase in the future 
in the event of large or rapid increases in prices  we may not be able to pass the increases through to our customers in full  which would reduce our operating margin 
national and regional economic conditions 
a majority of our revenues are from customers who are in industries and businesses that are cyclical in nature and subject to changes in general economic conditions 
in addition  since operations occur in a variety of geographic markets  our businesses are subject to the economic conditions in each such geographic market 
general economic downturns or localized downturns in the regions where we have operations  including any downturns in the construction industry or increases in capacity in the gypsum wallboard  paperboard and cement industries  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the seasonal nature of the company s business 
a majority of our business is seasonal with peak revenues and profits occurring primarily in the months of april through november 
quarterly results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future 
such variations could have a negative impact on the price of the company s common stock 
unfavorable weather conditions during peak construction periods and other unexpected operational difficulties 
because a majority of our business is seasonal  bad weather conditions and other unexpected operational difficulties during peak periods could adversely affect operating income and cash flow and could have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations for the full year 
competition from new or existing competitors or the ability to successfully penetrate new markets 
the construction products industry is highly competitive 
if we are unable to keep our products competitively priced  our sales could be reduced materially 
also  we may experience increased competition from companies offering products based on new processes that are more efficient or result in improvements in product performance  which could put us at a disadvantage and cause us to lose customers and sales volume 
our failure to continue to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental liabilities 
our operations are subject to state  federal and local environmental laws and regulations  which impose liability for cleanup or remediation of environmental pollution and hazardous waste arising from past acts  and require pollution control and prevention  site restoration and operating permits and or approvals to conduct certain of its operations 
certain of our operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of these laws and regulations 
risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses 
as a result  it is possible that environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 
compliance with governmental regulations 
our operations and our customers are subject to and affected by federal  state and local laws and regulations with respect to such matters and land usage  street and highway usage  noise level and health and safety and environmental matters 
in many instances  various permits are required for construction and related operations 
although management believes that we are in compliance in all material respects with regulatory requirements  there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with regulatory requirements or that demand for its products will be affected by regulatory issues affecting its customers 

table of contents events that may disrupt the us or world economy 
future terrorist attacks  the ensuing us military and other responsive actions  could have a significant adverse effect on the general economic  market and political conditions  which in turn could have material adverse effect on the company s business 
in general  the company is subject to the risks and uncertainties of the construction industry and of doing business in the us the forward looking statements are made as of the date of this report  and the company undertakes no obligation to update them  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its debt obligations and accounts receivable securitization classified as debt 
the company from time to time has utilized derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps  in conjunction with its overall strategy to manage the debt outstanding that is subject to changes in interest rates 
at march   the company had approximately million in variable rate debt million in bank debt and million in a note payable under the company s accounts receivable securitization program 
accordingly  using the unhedged balance of the company s variable rate debt as of march  of million  if the applicable interest rates on such debt libor or commercial paper rates increase by basis points for a full year  the company s pre tax earnings and cash flows would decrease by approximately  for such period 
on the other hand  if such interest rates decrease by basis points for a full year  the company s pre tax earnings and cash flows would increase by approximately  for such period 
the company does not currently utilize forward or option contacts on foreign currencies or other types of derivative financial instruments 
to date transactions in foreign currencies have been immaterial 
the company is subject to commodity risk with respect to price changes principally in coal  coke  natural gas and power 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changes in commodity prices by entering into short term fixed forward purchase contracts or increasing the use of alternative fuels
