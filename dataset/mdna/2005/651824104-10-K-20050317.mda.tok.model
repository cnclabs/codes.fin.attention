financial information regarding our business segments  and our operations by geographic area  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k beginning on page f a discussion of our net sales by end market and geographic area is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
sales and marketing we market and sell our products and services through our domestic and international sales organizations  an international network of independent distributors and sales representatives  product catalogs and our web site 
our domestic and international sales organizations are comprised of teams of field sales persons  which work closely with strategic account managers and internal sales support personnel based primarily in irvine  california  mountain view  california  germany  france and japan 
we have aligned our domestic and international sales organizations along our two key categories of customers end users and oem customers 
these two categories of customers require very different selling approaches and support requirements 
our oem subsystem and capital equipment customers often have unique technical specifications and manufacturing processes  and may require specific system  subsystem or component designs 
this requires close cooperation between our sales personnel and distributors and our engineering staff  and can result in long sales cycles for our subsystem and capital equipment products 
we also actively market and sell our products in certain markets outside of north america through independent sales representatives and distributors 
we have written agreements with most of our representatives and distributors 
in some cases we have granted representatives and distributors exclusive authorization to sell certain of our products in a specific geographic area 
these agreements generally have terms of one year which automatically renew on an annual basis  and are generally terminable by either party for convenience following a specified notice period 
most distributor agreements are structured to provide distributors with sales discounts below the domestic list price 
representatives are generally paid commissions for sales of products 
no single independent representative or distributor accounted for more than of our net sales in we also market our standard products through our product catalogs and our web site 
our principal marketing tools for the scientific research market are our comprehensive product catalogs  the newport resource and the 
table of contents newport oriel light resource 
these catalogs provide detailed product information as well as extensive technical and applications data 
we mail these catalogs to approximately  existing and potential customers 
the newport resource is published in english  french  german and japanese 
new product supplements for each catalog are also distributed between publications 
we also publish and distribute a variety of sales literature and product brochures relating to our other products and end markets 
our web site features an online catalog  providing customers with access to the latest information regarding our products  technical tutorial and application related materials  sales information  a literature and information request form  and the ability to purchase a majority of our standard products 
research and product development we continually seek to improve our technological leadership position through internal research  product development and licensing  and acquisitions of complementary technologies 
as of january   we had approximately employees engaged in research and development 
we continually work to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce innovative new products to satisfy the needs of our customers 
in addition  we regularly investigate new ways to combine components manufactured by our various divisions to produce innovative technological solutions for the markets we serve 
total research and development expenses were million  or of net sales  in  including the expenses of spectra physics for the period after july   the date of acquisition  million  or of net sales  in  and million  or of net sales  in research and development expenses attributable to our lasers division  which consisted entirely of the expenses of spectra physics after july   the date of acquisition  were million  or of net sales to that segment  in research and development expenses attributable to our photonics and precision technologies division were million  or of net sales to that segment  in  including the expenses of spectra physics for the period after july   the date of acquisition  million  or of net sales to that segment  in  and million  or of net sales to that segment  in research and development expenses attributable to our advanced packaging and automation systems division were million  or of net sales to that segment  in  million  or of net sales to that segment  in  and million  or of net sales to that segment  in we are committed to product development and expect to continue our investment in this area in the current and future years 
we believe that the continual development or acquisition of innovative new products will be critical to our future success 
failure to develop  or introduce on a timely basis  new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
customers we sell our products to a significant number of customers worldwide  in a wide range of diverse end markets  including semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging equipment  scientific research  aerospace and defense security  life and health sciences and fiber optic communications 
we believe that our diversification in this area minimizes our dependence on any single industry or group of customers 
in  no single customer represented or more of our consolidated net sales for the year 
in our lasers division  no single customer accounted for of more of our net sales to that segment after july   the date of our acquisition of spectra physics 
sales during to one customer of our photonics and precision technologies division totaled million  which represented of our net sales to that segment for the year 
sales during to two customers of our advanced packaging and automation systems division totaled million and million  which represented and  respectively  of our net sales to that segment for the year 
we believe that our relationships with these key customers are good 
however  if any of these key customers or any other key customer discontinues or reduces its relationship with us  or suffers downturns in its business  it could have a significant negative impact on our financial results on a short term basis  and our business and results of operations could be harmed going forward if we are unable to sufficiently expand our customer base to replace the lost business 

table of contents competition the primary end markets that we serve include scientific research  aerospace and defense security  microelectronics which is comprised primarily of semiconductor capital equipment customers  life and health sciences  and other end markets which includes general industrial and fiber optic communications customers 
these markets are intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology 
a small number of competitors are dominant in certain of these markets 
the products and systems developed and manufactured by our photonics and precision technologies division and our lasers division serve all of our target end markets 
our advanced packaging and automation systems division serves primarily the microelectronics market

table of contents in our semiconductor automation and fiber optic device assembly product lines  we also face competition from certain of our existing and potential customers who have developed or may develop their own systems  subsystems and components 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in our markets are product features and performance  quality  reliability and service support  customer relationships  ability to manufacture and deliver products on a timely basis  pricing  and ability to customize products to customer specifications 
we believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to each of these factors 
however  we may not be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors 
we compete in various markets against a number of companies  some of which have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and significantly greater technical  financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  some of these companies have long established relationships with our customers and potential customers in our markets 
in addition to current competitors  we believe that new competitors  some of whom may have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us  will seek to provide products to one or more of our markets in the future 
such future competition could harm our business 
intellectual property and proprietary rights our success and competitiveness depends to an extent on our technology and other intellectual property such as trade secrets  patents and trademarks 
we protect our technology by controlling access to our proprietary information and by maintaining confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  customers and suppliers  and  in some cases  through the use of patents  trademark registrations and licenses 
we have been granted approximately patents in the us and foreign jurisdictions  and we have approximately additional patent applications pending 
these issued patents cover various aspects of products in many of our key product categories  particularly our laser products 
we also have trademarks registered in the us and foreign jurisdictions 
we will continue to actively pursue applications for new patents and trademarks as we deem appropriate 
it is possible that  despite our efforts  other parties may use  obtain or try to copy our products and technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products and technology is difficult and time consuming 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we take to protect our rights will prevent any misappropriation of our products or technology 
this is particularly the case in foreign jurisdictions  where the intellectual property laws may not afford our intellectual property rights the same protection as the laws of the united states 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights in order to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors  which claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel 
in addition  infringement  invalidity  right to use or ownership claims by third parties may be asserted against us in the future 
we expect that the number and significance of these matters will increase as our business expands 
in particular  the laser industry is characterized by a very large number of patents  many of which are of questionable validity and some of which appear to overlap with other issued patents 
as a result  there is a significant amount of uncertainty in the industry regarding patent protection and infringement 
any claims of infringement brought by third parties could result in protracted and costly litigation  and we could become subject to damages for 
table of contents infringement  or to an injunction preventing us from selling one or more of our products or using one or more of our trademarks 
such claims could also result in the necessity of obtaining a license relating to one or more of our products or current or future technologies  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
any intellectual property litigation and the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or develop substitute technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing we manufacture lasers and laser systems at our facilities located in mountain view  california  and we manufacture laser diodes in tucson  arizona 
we manufacture instruments  components  subassemblies and systems at domestic facilities located in irvine  california  oroville  california  richmond  california  stratford  connecticut  franklin  massachusetts  north billerica  massachusetts  and rochester  new york  and at international facilities in beaune la rolande  france  brigueuil  france  and margate  united kingdom 
in addition  we subcontract the manufacture of various products and components to a number of third party subcontractors 
our manufacturing processes are diverse and consist of purchasing raw materials  principally stainless steel  aluminum and glass  processing the raw materials into components  subassemblies and finished products  purchasing components  assembling and testing components and subassemblies  and  for our larger products  assembling the subassemblies and components into integrated systems 
we primarily design and manufacture our products internally  although on a limited basis  we purchase completed products from certain third party suppliers and resell those products through our distribution system 
most of these completed products are produced to our specifications and carry our name and logo 
we currently procure various components and materials  such as the sheet steel used in some of our vibration isolation tables  and the laser crystals used in certain of our laser products  from single sources due to unique component designs as well as certain quality and performance requirements needed to manufacture our products 
in addition  we manufacture certain components internally  and there are no readily available third party suppliers of these components 
if single sourced components were to become unavailable in adequate amounts at acceptable quality levels or were to become unavailable on terms satisfactory to us  we would be required to purchase comparable components from other sources 
while we believe that we would be able to obtain comparable replacement components from other sources in a timely manner  if we are unable to do so our business  results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
backlog our consolidated backlog of orders totaled million at january   and million at december  as of january   million of our consolidated backlog was scheduled to be shipped on or before december  orders for many of the products we sell to the semiconductor equipment market  which comprise a significant portion of our sales  are often subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer without penalty  and we have from time to time experienced significant cancellations and pushouts of orders from these markets  which negatively affected our operating results in those periods 
in addition  because we manufacture a significant portion of our standard catalog products for inventory  we often make shipments of these products upon or within a short time period following receipt of an order 
as a result  our backlog of orders at any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of our sales for succeeding periods 
investments from time to time we make investments in companies having operations or technologies in areas which are within or adjacent to our strategic focus when acquired 
we currently hold minority ownership interests in a number of small  privately held companies 
these investments are designed to further our strategic objectives and to support our key business initiatives 
we want to support growth in new technologies  particularly those related to our strategic markets  in order to create and expand markets for our products 
while financial returns are not our primary goal  our strategic investment program seeks to invest in companies that can succeed and have a positive 
table of contents impact on their markets 
at january   the total carrying value of all of our minority interest investments was million 
investments in technology companies involve significant risks  including the risks that such companies may be unable to raise additional required operating capital on acceptable terms or at all  or may not achieve or maintain market acceptance of their technology or products 
in the event that any of such risks occurs  the value of our investment could decline significantly 
in addition  because there is no public market for the securities we acquire  our ability to liquidate our investments is limited  and such markets may not develop in the future 
in  two fiber optic component manufacturers in which we had made minority interest investments in prior years experienced severe financial difficulties  and each has shut down its operations and liquidated its assets 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million to write down these investments to their estimated fair value 
in  we determined that a minority interest investment made in prior years in a manufacturer of precision mechanical components had incurred an other than temporary reduction in value 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million to write down the investment to its estimated fair value 
in the event that we are required to write down the carrying value of one or more of our investments in the future  our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
employees as of january   we had approximately  employees worldwide 
none of our employees are represented by a union 
we believe that our relationships with our employees are good 
government regulation regulatory compliance our lasers and laser based systems are subject to the laser radiation safety regulations of the radiation control for health and safety act administered by the center for devices and radiological health cdrh of the united states food and drug administration fda 
among other things  these regulations require a laser manufacturer to file new product and annual reports  to maintain quality control and sales records  to perform product testing  to distribute appropriate operating manuals  to incorporate certain design and operating features in lasers sold to end users and to certify and label each laser sold to end users as one of four classes based on the level of radiation from the laser that is accessible to users 
various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices installed depending on the class of product 
the national center for devices and radiological health is empowered to seek fines and other remedies for violations of the regulatory requirements 
we are also subject to comparable laser safety regulations with regard to laser products sold in europe 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with these regulations 
environmental regulation our operations are subject to various federal  state and local environmental protection regulations relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
in the united states  we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the environmental protection agency 
comparable authorities exist in other countries 
some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution  and these permits are subject to modification  renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 
future developments  administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
although we believe that our safety procedures for using  handling  storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by state and federal laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of such an accident involving such materials  we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business 

table of contents spectra physics mountain view  california facility is an epa designated superfund site and is subject to a cleanup and abatement order from the california regional water quality control board 
spectra physics  along with several other entities with facilities located near the mountain view  california facility  have been identified as responsible parties with respect to this superfund site  due to releases of hazardous substances during the s and s 
the site is mature  and investigations and remediation efforts have been ongoing for approximately years 
spectra physics and the other responsible parties have entered into a cost sharing agreement covering the costs of remediating the off site groundwater impact 
we have established reserves relating to the estimated cost of these remediation efforts  however our ultimate costs of remediation are difficult to predict 
in addition  while we are not aware of any unresolved property damage or personal injury claims relating to this site  such claims could be made against us in the future 
while thermo electron corporation has agreed in connection with our purchase of spectra physics to indemnify us  subject to certain conditions  for environmental liabilities relating to this site in excess of our reserves  this indemnity may not cover all liabilities relating to this site

this discussion includes the effects of the acquisitions of spectra physics and mrsi from their respective dates of acquisition 
divestitures in august  to increase the efficiency of our product development and manufacturing efforts  our board of directors approved management s plan to sell our operation in plymouth  minnesota  which manufactured high precision motion stages for the semiconductor equipment  computer peripheral  fiber optic communications and life and health sciences markets 
in the first quarter of  due to the weak response from potential buyers  we shut down the operation and liquidated the majority of the remaining assets 
this operation was included in our former industrial and scientific technologies division 
in march  to more efficiently deploy our resources to those areas that are critical to product development efforts for our strategic markets  our board of directors approved management s plan to sell our industrial metrology systems division imsd  including the business of cejohansson ab  a sweden based global supplier of advanced metrology systems that we acquired in december the sale of imsd was substantially completed in in february  we settled an outstanding dispute with the purchaser of a portion of imsd  resulting in a charge to discontinued operations of approximately million in the fourth quarter of both of these divestitures have been accounted for as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

table of contents fiscal year end effective in  we changed to a conventional week accounting fiscal year 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december  and our fiscal quarters end on the saturday closest to the end of each corresponding calendar quarter 
fiscal year referred to herein as ended on january  and fiscal years and ended on december  and  respectively 
end markets in connection with our acquisition of spectra physics in the third quarter of  we realigned our end markets into four customer markets scientific research  aerospace and defense security  microelectronics which is comprised primarily of semiconductor capital equipment customers  life and health sciences  and all other end markets which includes general industrial and fiber optic communications customers 
our discussion of our results of operations includes comparisons within these end markets and our results for the fiscal years ended december  and have been reclassified to conform to this realignment 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  warranty obligations  restructuring reserves  asset impairment valuations  pension liabilities and income tax valuations 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions by their nature involve risks and uncertainties  and may prove to be inaccurate 
in the event that any of our estimates or assumptions are inaccurate in any material respect  it could have a material adverse effect on our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue after title to and risk of loss of products have passed to the customer which typically occurs upon shipment  or delivery of the service has been completed  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we recognize revenue and related costs for arrangements with multiple deliverables  such as equipment and installation  as each element is delivered or completed based upon its relative fair value  determined based upon the price that would be charged on a standalone basis 
however  if a portion of the total contract price is not payable until installation is complete  we defer revenue up to the amount that is not payable 
we defer revenues for training until the service is completed 
we recognize revenue for extended service contracts over the related contract periods 
our customers generally have days from the original invoice date generally days for international customers to return a standard catalog product purchase for exchange or credit 
catalog products must be returned in the original condition and meet certain other criteria 
product returns of catalog items have historically been insignificant and are charged against revenue in the period returned 
custom  option configured and certain other products as defined in the terms and conditions of sale cannot be returned 
for certain non catalog products  we establish a sales return reserve based on the historical product returns 

table of contents accounts and notes receivable we record reserves for specific receivables deemed to be at risk for collection  as well as a reserve based on our historical collections experience 
we estimate the collectibility of customer receivables on an ongoing basis by reviewing past due invoices 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
certain of our japanese customers provide us with promissory notes on the due date of the receivable 
the payment date of the promissory notes is generally days from the original receivable due date 
subsequently  certain of these promissory notes are sold with recourse to one of four banks within japan that we do business with as part of line of credit agreements 
such transactions are conducted in the ordinary course of business 
for balance sheet presentation purposes  amounts due to us under such promissory notes are reclassified from accounts receivable to current notes receivable 
at january   total promissory notes receivable amounted to million 
promissory notes sold with recourse are included in both notes receivable  net and short term obligations until the underlying note obligations are ultimately satisfied by payment of the note obligation by the customers to the banks 
at january   such discounted note obligations included in short term obligations were million 
we did not have any notes receivable or notes sold with recourse outstanding at december  pension plans several of our non us subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full time employees at those subsidiaries 
some of the plans are unfunded  as permitted under the plans and applicable laws 
for financial reporting purposes  the calculation of net periodic pension costs is based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate for plan obligations  an assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and an assumed rate of compensation increase for employees covered by the plan 
all of these assumptions are based upon our judgment  considering all known trends and uncertainties 
actual results that differ from these assumptions would impact future expense recognition and the cash funding requirements of our pension plans 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost determined on either a first in  first out fifo or average cost basis or fair market value and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to net realizable value 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare those requirements with the current or committed inventory levels 
we record any amounts required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value as a charge to cost of sales 
warranty unless otherwise stated in our product literature or in our agreements with our customers  products sold by our photonics and precision technologies division generally carry a one year warranty from the original invoice date on all product material and workmanship 
products of such division sold to original equipment manufacturer oem customers generally carry longer warranties  typically to months 
products sold by our lasers division generally carry warranties that vary by product and product component  but generally range from days to two years 
in certain cases  such warranties are limited by amount of usage of the product 
defective products will be either repaired or replaced  generally at our option  upon meeting certain criteria 
we accrue a provision for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties relating to a product as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue for that product is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage and or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty obligation would be required which could adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents impairment of assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments  related primarily to the future profitability and or future value of the assets 
changes in our strategic plan and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and could require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technologies in areas which are within or adjacent to our strategic focus when acquired  all of which are privately held and whose values are difficult to determine 
we record an investment impairment charge in any reporting period where we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future changes in our strategic direction  adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we perform annual impairment tests of our goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to impairment tests based upon a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units  as defined  and the carrying value of the reporting units net assets  including goodwill 
sfas no 
requires a review of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when circumstances exist that would indicate an impairment of such goodwill or other intangible assets 
we perform the annual impairment review as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on the estimated effective income tax rate for the complete fiscal year 
the income tax provision benefit is computed on the pretax income loss of the consolidated entities located within each taxing jurisdiction based on current tax law 
deferred taxes result from the future tax consequences associated with temporary differences between the recorded amounts of our assets and liabilities for tax and financial accounting purposes 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded to the extent we cannot determine  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  that the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
we recorded a valuation reserve in the third quarter of against our deferred tax assets pursuant to sfas no 
 due to the uncertainty as to the timing and ultimate realization of those assets 
as such  we did not recognize any tax benefit on the losses recorded in and recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for the current period 
for the foreseeable future  the federal tax provision related to future earnings will be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation reserve  and any future pretax losses will not be offset by a tax benefit due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  future tax expense will consist primarily of certain required state income taxes and taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions 
realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon our achievement of future taxable income  the estimation of which requires significant management judgment 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors  including future market conditions and our ability to successfully execute our business plans and or tax planning strategies 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
acquired deferred tax assets and liabilities  and liabilities for prior tax returns at the date of purchase are based on management s best estimate of the ultimate settlement that will be accepted by the tax authorities 
management continually evaluates these matters 
at the date of a material change in management s best estimate of items relating to an acquired entity s prior tax returns  and at the date that the items are settled with the tax authorities  any liability previously recognized is adjusted to increase or decrease the remaining balance of goodwill attributable to that acquisition 

table of contents in connection with the acquisition of spectra physics  we acquired million in domestic deferred tax liabilities and million in domestic deferred tax assets 
the acquired net deferred tax liability of million reduced our previously recorded net deferred tax asset accordingly 
the remainder of these deferred taxes were recorded as a reduction to goodwill 
on march   congress passed the job creation and worker assistance act of tax act 
as part of the tax act  the carryback period for net operating losses increased from two to five years 
as a result of the tax law change  federal net operating loss carryback benefits relating to the loss sustained during the year ended december  increased by approximately million 
such amounts have been included in the federal benefits amount reported for the year ended december  on october   the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
the ajca provides several incentives for us multinational corporations and us manufacturers  subject to certain limitations  the incentives include an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations that repatriate accumulated income abroad  and a deduction for domestic qualified production activities taxable income 
the us treasury department is expected to issue guidance with regards to these provisions 
until this guidance is issued  we will not be able to evaluate whether to take advantage of this opportunity and the potential impact on our income tax provision  if any 
we are routinely under audit by federal  state or foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questioning the timing and amount of deductions  the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal  state and local tax laws 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  we often accrue charges for probable exposures 
during  we concluded a number of tax examinations with favorable results 
therefore  during the annual evaluation of tax positions for  we decreased the amount previously accrued for probable exposures 
at january   we believe that we have appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
accrued restructuring costs restructuring plan in connection with the acquisition of spectra physics  we began to formulate a restructuring plan in the third quarter of to consolidate certain locations and such preliminary plan was approved by our board of directors 
we are still finalizing this plan with respect to the employee severance  relocation and facility closure costs required for certain locations 
changes in these costs with respect to spectra physics locations will result in adjustments to goodwill 
we expect to finalize such plan by the end of the second quarter of this plan currently includes million for employee relocation and employee severance and related termination costs and million related to facility consolidations 
the employee severance and relocation actions will involve approximately to employees across all functions and are expected to be completed by the end of the following table summarizes the activity in accrued restructuring costs related to the purchase of spectra physics that involve the payment of cash in thousands employee relocation and severance facility consolidation total liabilities assumed in purchase accounting cash payments accrued restructuring at january  
table of contents the facility consolidation costs will be paid over the associated lease terms  which expire at various dates between and at january   million of these accrued restructuring costs were expected to be paid within one year and are included in current liabilities in accrued restructuring costs and million of accrued restructuring costs are included in long term liabilities in accrued restructuring costs and other liabilities 
restructuring plan during  in response to the continued severe downturn in the fiber optic communications market and the uncertainty with respect to the pace of recovery in the semiconductor equipment market  our board of directors approved a restructuring and cost reduction plan designed to bring our operating costs in line with our business outlook at that time

net sales to other international customers increased million  or  in compared with  and decreased million  or  in compared with the increase in sales to international customers in compared with was due primarily to the addition of spectra physics sales from the july  acquisition date  which contributed million to international sales in in addition  our existing businesses saw sales increases to international customers totaling million  a increase compared with the decline in sales to international customers in compared with was due primarily to decreases in sales to our end markets as described above  primarily sales to customers in the fiber optic communications market 
the results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
as the value of the us dollar weakens relative to other currencies  sales in those currencies convert to more us dollars  conversely  when the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies  sales in those countries convert to fewer us dollars 
currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on our results for compared with and we expect net sales to be flat to down slightly in the first quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of due to the continuing softness in the microelectronics market and the historical seasonality in the scientific research market  offset by increases in sales to our other markets 
however  our business is subject to risks arising from market conditions in our primary end markets  as well as from general economic conditions 
we expect that our sales to the scientific research  aerospace and defense security markets will be flat to down slightly in the first quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of due to the record fourth quarter sales level and the historical seasonality in the scientific research market 
overall  we expect that our sales to these markets will fluctuate from period to period in line with changes in overall research and defense spending levels  but will increase over time as we increase our penetration of these markets 

table of contents we expect our sales to the microelectronics market to decrease slightly in the first quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of and remain flat to slightly down for the next few quarters thereafter  consistent with the overall trend in this market 
however  the duration and extent of this downturn is difficult to predict and represents a significant uncertainty with respect to our future operating results 
we expect our sales to the life and health sciences market for the first quarter of to be flat to up slightly compared with the fourth quarter of due to increased sales to one of our largest customers in this market 
in general  we expect our sales to this market to fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis in the short term due to our concentration of significant oem customers in this market  but to increase over time as we increase our penetration of this market 
gross margin gross margin was  and for  and  respectively 
gross margin for was positively impacted by the addition of spectra physics sales  which carried higher overall gross margins  from the july  acquisition date  but this impact was more than offset by charges to cost of sales for acquisition  integration and other items 
these included million  or of net sales  related to the sale of acquired inventory that had been written up to an amount that includes a normal selling margin in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and sold during the second half of these also included a charge of million  or of net sales  that was comprised of million of inventory associated primarily with certain discontinued product lines that we reserved for and are in the process of disposing of  and million for inventory that we wrote off and disposed of in due to facility consolidations 
in addition  gross margins in were negatively impacted by charges to cost of sales of million related to the impairment of certain intangible assets of our apas division and million related to the impairment of an intellectual property intangible asset 
these impairment charges are discussed in more detail in note  restructuring  impairment and other charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our overall gross margins in were negatively impacted by previously capitalized underabsorbed overhead costs 
products sold in were produced during periods in which substantial unabsorbed overhead costs were allocated to inventory 
these variances  which were caused primarily by lower sales volume and production activity  were capitalized when the inventory was produced and are charged to cost of sales when the related products are sold 
the negative effect of these capitalized variances was offset in part by the cost reduction actions that we implemented during the second half of and throughout  including facility consolidations and headcount reductions 
gross margin for included charges to cost of sales for increased inventory reserves of million  or of net sales  as part of the cost reduction plans discussed previously 
in addition to the increased inventory reserve charge  gross margins were also negatively impacted by underabsorbed overhead costs caused by significantly lower overall sales volume and lower fixed overhead absorption in  offset in part by lower sales to oem customers 
in the next several quarters  we expect gross margins to continue to improve from the levels  due primarily to reduced levels of inventory write offs and previously capitalized variances  and to the positive effects of adding the results of spectra physics  which generally has higher overall gross margins  for a full year 
in addition  we expect gross margins to be positively impacted by the results of our integration actions due to increased manufacturing efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense sg a expense totaled million  or of net sales  million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales of  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars in compared with was attributable primarily to the addition of million of sg a expense of spectra physics from the acquisition date of july  and to million of amortization of acquired intangible assets related to the acquisition 
the remainder of the increase in sg a expense in compared with was attributable primarily to an increase in variable selling expenses and incentive compensation associated with the higher sales volume  increased accounting and auditing fees due to our increased size  and outside consulting fees related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of 
table of contents sg a expense for included expenses in the third quarter of million  or of net sales  for costs incurred in connection with our cost reduction initiatives 
the decrease in absolute dollars in compared with was attributable primarily to the impact of the significant cost reduction actions we commenced in the benefits of these cost reduction actions were offset in part by the inclusion of a full year of sg a expense relating to mrsi  which we acquired in february  and for which there was not a full year of costs in  and by higher legal expenses incurred in to protect our intellectual property 
we expect that sg a expense for the first quarter of will again be impacted significantly by acquisition and integration charges 
in general  we expect that sg a expense will fluctuate as a percentage of sales in the future based on our sales level in any given period 
because the majority of our sg a expense is fixed in the short term  these fluctuations will likely not be in proportion to the changes in net sales 
research and development r d expense r d expense totaled million or of net sales  million  or of net sales and million  or of net sales  for  and  respectively 
r d expense increased million  or  in compared with this increase was attributable primarily to the addition of expenses for spectra physics from the acquisition date of july   which were million  offset in part by reductions in r d spending in the fiber optic communications area  as well as by the results of our efforts to maximize the focus and efficiency of our r d activities 
r d expense decreased million  or  in compared with this decrease was attributable primarily to reductions in r d spending in the fiber optic communications area  as well as our efforts to maximize the focus and efficiency of our r d efforts  offset in part by the inclusion of a full year of r d expenses associated with the operations of mrsi  for which there was not a full year of costs in we expect that r d expense in the first quarter of will be comparable with the fourth quarter level 
we believe that the continued development and advancement of our key products and technologies is critical to our future success  and we intend to continue to invest in key r d initiatives  while working to ensure that the efforts are focused and the funds are deployed efficiently 
in general  we expect that r d expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate in the future based on our sales level in any given period 
because of our commitment to continued product development  and because the majority of our r d expense is fixed in the short term  these fluctuations will likely not be in proportion to the changes in net sales 
restructuring  impairment and other charges restructuring  impairment and other charges totaled million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the following table summarizes these charges years ended in thousands january  december  december  asset impairment  including goodwill restructuring plan charge severance in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual review of goodwill and other intangible assets and determined that goodwill and other intangible assets at our advanced packaging and automation systems division were impaired 
in addition  in the third and fourth quarters of  we reviewed fixed assets at facilities impacted by the integration of spectra physics and identified duplicate and unnecessary assets 
as a result of these actions  we recorded restructuring  impairment and other charges in for impairment of goodwill and other acquired assets of approximately million 

table of contents during  in response to the continued severe downturn in the fiber optic communications market and the uncertainty with respect to the pace of recovery in the semiconductor equipment market  our board of directors approved a restructuring and cost reduction plan designed to bring our operating costs in line with our business outlook at that time 
in connection with this plan  we recorded a charge of million in in and  we increased our estimate of the required reserve for facility consolidations under this plan by million and million  respectively  to reflect settlements of our remaining lease obligations for certain leases as well as revised estimates of future sublease income 
restructuring  impairment and other charges in also included severance costs of million for cost reduction actions taken in as part of the integration of spectra physics 
such charges for included severance costs of million for cost reduction actions taken in for employees that were not included in the original restructuring charge 
these restructuring  impairment and other charges are discussed in more detail in note  restructuring  impairment and other charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other expense  net  totaled million for  compared with interest and other income  net of million and million for and  respectively 
interest and other expense  net was negatively impacted in compared with by lower interest income earned due to lower yields on cash and marketable securities and lower overall balances of cash and marketable securities due to the cash paid to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for spectra physics 
in addition  such amount was negatively impacted by increased interest expense due to the debt issued to fund the purchase price of spectra physics and interest expense on lines of credit we assumed in the acquisition 
interest and other expense  net in was also negatively impacted by a charge of million for losses on sales of marketable securities prior to their maturity in order to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for spectra physics 
the decrease in interest and other income  net in compared with was due primarily to lower interest earned due to lower yields on cash and marketable securities 
we expect to incur interest and other expense  net  in future periods  due primarily to interest expense incurred on short term and long term debt  offset in part by interest earned on cash and marketable securities 
investment write downs in  we determined that a minority interest investment made in prior years in a manufacturer of precision mechanical components had incurred an other than temporary reduction in value 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million to write down the investment to its estimated fair value 
in  two fiber optic component manufacturers in which we had made minority interest investments in prior years experienced severe financial difficulties 
each manufacturer has shut down its operations and liquidated its assets 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million to write down these investments to their estimated fair value 
income taxes our effective tax rates from continuing operations were  and for  and  respectively 
during  the internal revenue service and the california franchise tax board completed certain examinations of mrsi 
based on the favorable conclusions of these examinations  we recorded a reduction in mrsi s tax contingency reserve of approximately million 
the net income tax benefit of million recorded in was attributable to this reduction in tax contingency reserve  offset in part by certain required state income taxes and taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions 
in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  compared with a million income tax expense in the income tax benefit in was attributable to federal income tax refunds and refundable foreign income tax incentives related to research and development  and to the favorable settlement of various irs 
table of contents examinations 
the income tax expense in resulted from a valuation allowance that was recorded against a portion of our deferred tax assets pursuant to sfas no 
 due to the uncertainty as to the timing and ultimate realization of those assets 
as such  we did not recognize any tax benefit on the losses recorded in these periods 
we have recorded a valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets pursuant to sfas no 
 due to the uncertainty as to the timing and ultimate realization of those assets 
as such  for the foreseeable future  the federal tax provision related to future earnings will be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation reserve  and any future pretax losses will not be offset by a tax benefit due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we expect that current and future tax expense will consist primarily of certain required state income taxes and taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by our operating activities of million for was attributable primarily to the cash provided by our results of operations  a decrease in inventories and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments  offset in part by an increase in accounts and notes receivable as a result of higher sales at the end of the fourth quarter and cash paid for accrued restructuring costs 
net cash provided by investing activities of million for consisted primarily of net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of million  offset by net cash used in the acquisition of spectra physics of million and net purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for consisted of proceeds of million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option and employee stock purchase plans and net proceeds from short term borrowings of million  offset in part by payments of capital lease obligations of million 
at january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and marketable securities of million 
the majority of these securities are invested in one portfolio managed by a professional investment management firm  under the oversight of our senior financial management team 
this portfolio manager invests the funds allocated in accordance with our investment policy  which is reviewed regularly by our senior financial management and the audit committee of our board of directors 
in  we used approximately million of cash to acquire spectra physics  and we used additional cash for acquisition  integration and related items 
we expect that our cash balances will fluctuate in the future based on factors such as cash used in or provided by ongoing operations  acquisitions or divestitures  investments in other companies  share repurchases  capital expenditures and contractual obligations  and changes in interest rates 
at january   we had in place a million revolving line of credit expiring december  certain of the marketable securities that are being managed by the lending institution collateralize the line of credit 
the line bears interest at either the prevailing prime rate  or the prevailing london interbank offered rate at january  plus  at our option  and an unused line fee of per year 
at january   there were no balances outstanding under the line of credit  with million available under the line  after considering outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million 
at january   we had in place two revolving lines of credit totaling billion yen million at january  at two japanese banks expiring as follows million on november  and million on march  the lines are not secured and bear interest at the prevailing bank rate 
at january   we had million outstanding under these lines of credit  with million available for borrowing 
in addition  we had in place four lines of credit totaling million yen million at january  to be used to sell notes receivable with recourse at four japanese banks 
these lines have no expiration date and bear interest at the bank s prevailing rate 
at january   we had million outstanding under these lines  with million available for the sale of notes receivable 
the weighted average interest rate on all borrowings on these lines under these lines was 

table of contents in july  as part of the purchase price for spectra physics  we issued an unsecured promissory note to thermo electron corporation in the principal amount of million  which bears interest at per annum  payable quarterly  and is due and payable in full on july  in  we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program 
the board authorized us to purchase up to million shares  or of our then outstanding stock 
the purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  and the timing and amount of the purchases will be based on factors including our share price  cash balances  expected cash requirements and general business and market conditions 
during  we repurchased  shares under this program at a cost of million 
we did not make any purchases under this program in  and any future purchases will depend on the aforementioned factors 
we lease certain of our manufacturing and office facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases  certain of which contain renewal options 
in addition to the base rent  we are generally required to pay insurance  real estate taxes and other operating expenses and  in some cases  additional rentals based on increases in the consumer price index 
as of january   we had no material purchase obligations 
our long term debt  and capital and operating lease obligations at january  are summarized as follows in thousands capital leases operating leases long term debt total obligations payments due by period thereafter total minimum lease payments less amount representing interest present value of net minimum capital lease payments we believe our current working capital position  together with our expected future cash flows from operations will be adequate to fund our operations in the ordinary course of business  anticipated capital expenditures  debt payment requirements and other contractual obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  this belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject to numerous risks see risks relating to our business on pages  and there can be no assurance that we will not require additional funding in the future 
we have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies or any material capital expenditures 
however  we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of and or investments in products  technologies  capital equipment or improvements or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions and or investments in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any such acquisitions and or investments 
we cannot assure you that any such financing would be available  or that  if available  such financing would be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive

although the assessment is ongoing  management believes the impact will be material to our consolidated results of operations 
if we had applied the provisions of sfas no 
r to the financial statements for the period ended january   our net loss would have been increased by approximately million 
however  due to the alternative option pricing models and assumptions  the lower numbers of options granted in recent years  and the lower valuations of such options compared with options granted previously  this figure will likely not be representative of the impact to future results of operations

table of contents risks relating to our business the following is a summary of certain risks we face in our business 
they are not the only risks we face 
additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business and results of operations 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks  and investors could lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we may not be able to effectively or completely integrate the business and operations of spectra physics or future acquisitions  which could materially harm our operating results 
in connection with our acquisition of spectra physics  we face several significant challenges in integrating the business and operations of spectra physics with our own 
we may not be able to achieve the integration in an effective  complete  timely or cost efficient manner 
the acquisition of spectra physics approximately doubled our size  including with respect to revenue  number of employees and facilities 
the acquisition and integration of spectra physics with our operations involves substantial risks  including our overall ability to integrate and manage spectra physics operations  products and personnel  our ability to integrate the products of spectra physics so that they complement our own  our ability to continue the development of the spectra physics products and underlying technology  our ability to manufacture and sell the spectra physics products  a decline in the demand for the spectra physics products in the marketplace  our ability to retain and expand the customer base of spectra physics  customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with the spectra physics products  our ability to integrate the international operations of spectra physics  particularly in those countries in which we have not had prior operations  our ability to retain key personnel who remained employed with spectra physics following the acquisition  our ability to expand our financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures to integrate and manage spectra physics  our ability to realize expected synergies resulting from the acquisition  diversion of management s time and attention  administrative integration and elimination of redundancies  assumption of unknown or contingent liabilities  or other unanticipated events or circumstances  our ability to maintain the competitiveness of spectra physics and its products and technology in the marketplace  and 
table of contents the need to incur or record significant cash or non cash charges or write down the carrying value of intangible assets obtained in the spectra physics acquisition  which could adversely impact our cash flow or lower our earnings in the period or periods for which we incur such charges or write down such assets 
the business and operations of spectra physics may not achieve the anticipated revenues and operating results 
we may in the future choose to close or divest certain sectors or divisions of spectra physics  which could require us to record losses and or spend cash relating to such closures or divestitures 
any of the foregoing risks could materially harm our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
in addition  we have in the past  and expect in the future  to achieve growth through a combination of internally developed new products and acquisitions 
in recent years we have acquired several companies and technologies in addition to spectra physics  and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies  technologies and complementary product lines in the future to expand our product offerings and technology base to further our strategic goals 
we have faced and continue to face the same and other similar risks as referenced above in connection with our prior acquisitions  and we expect that we would face the same and other similar risks as referenced above in connection with any such future acquisitions 
our operating results are difficult to predict  and if we fail to meet the expectations of investors and or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock will likely decline significantly 
our operating results in any given quarter have fluctuated and will likely continue to fluctuate 
these fluctuations are typically unpredictable and can result from numerous factors including fluctuations in our customers capital spending  industry cyclicality particularly in the semiconductor industry  levels of government funding available to our customers  and other economic conditions within the markets we serve  demand for our products and the products sold by our customers  the level of orders within a given quarter and preceding quarters  the timing and level of cancellations and delays of orders for our products  the timing of product shipments within a given quarter  our timing in introducing new products  variations in the mix of products we sell in each of the markets in which we do business  changes in our pricing policies or in the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers  market acceptance of any new or enhanced versions of our products  the availability and cost of key components and raw materials we use to manufacture our products  our ability to manufacture a sufficient quantity of our products to meet customer demand  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  timing of new product introductions by our competitors  and our levels of expenses 

table of contents we may in the future choose to change prices  increase spending  or add or eliminate products in response to actions by competitors or in an effort to pursue new market opportunities 
these actions may also adversely affect our business and operating results and may cause our quarterly results to be lower than the results of previous quarters 
in addition  we often recognize a substantial portion of our sales in the last month of the quarter 
thus  unexpected variations in timing of sales  particularly for our higher priced  higher margin products such as our laser products  can cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
orders expected in one quarter could shift to another period due to changes in the anticipated timing of customers purchase decisions or rescheduled delivery dates requested by our customers 
our operating results for a particular quarter or year may be adversely affected if our customers  particularly our largest customers  cancel or reschedule orders  or if we cannot fill orders in time due to unexpected delays in manufacturing  testing  shipping  and product acceptance 
also  we base our manufacturing on our forecasted product mix for the quarter 
if the actual product mix varies significantly from our forecast  we may not be able to fill some orders during that quarter  which would result in delays in the shipment of our products and could shift sales to a subsequent period 
in addition  our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales  and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly to compensate for the shortfall 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results from operations  or any other similar period to period comparisons  should not be construed as reliable indicators of our future performance 
in any period  our results may be below the expectations of market analysts and investors  which would likely cause the trading price of our common stock to drop 
we are highly dependent on the semiconductor equipment industry  which is volatile and unpredictable 
a substantial portion of our current and expected future business comes from sales of components  subsystems and laser products to manufacturers of semiconductor fabrication  metrology and wafer inspection equipment and sales of capital equipment to integrated semiconductor device manufacturers 
the semiconductor market has historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
the timing  severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult to predict  and we may not be able to respond effectively to these cycles 
the continuing uncertainty in this market severely limits our ability to predict our business prospects or financial results in this market 
during industry downturns  our revenues from this market will decline suddenly and significantly 
our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in next generation product technology and to support and service our products 
in addition  due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times for some of the systems and  subsystems we sell to this market  we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we cannot sell 
accordingly  downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment market may materially harm our operating results 
conversely  when upturns in this market occur  we must be able to rapidly and effectively increase our manufacturing capacity to meet increases in customer demand that may be extremely rapid  and if we fail to do so we may lose business to our competitors and our relationships with our customers may be harmed 
a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales to the microelectronics market  and if we lose any of these customers or they significantly curtail their purchases of our products  our results of operations would be harmed 
our sales to the microelectronics market which is comprised primarily of semiconductor capital equipment customers constituted  and of our consolidated net sales for the year ended january  which includes spectra physics results of operations for the period after july   the date of acquisition  and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our sales to this market 
our top five customers in this market comprised approximately 
table of contents   and of our sales to this market for the year ended january  which includes spectra physics results of operations for the period after july   the date of acquisition  and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
no single customer in this market comprised or more of our consolidated net sales in if any of our principal customers discontinues its relationship with us  replaces us as a vendor for certain products or suffers downturns in its business  our business and results of operations could be harmed significantly 
in addition  because a relatively small number of companies dominate the front end equipment portion of this market  and because those companies rarely change vendors in the middle of a product s life cycle  it may be particularly difficult for us to replace these customers if we lose their business 
the microelectronics market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions  changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
because our customers face uncertainties with regard to the growth and requirements of these markets  their products and components may not achieve  or continue to achieve  anticipated levels of market acceptance 
if our customers are unable to deliver products that gain market acceptance  it is likely that these customers will not purchase our products or will purchase smaller quantities of our products 
we often invest substantial resources in developing our systems and subsystems in advance of significant sales of these systems and or subsystems to such customers 
a failure on the part of our customers products to gain market acceptance  or a failure of the semiconductor capital equipment market to grow would have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations 
a significant portion of our future growth is dependent on the growth of mm semiconductor wafer processes and lower than expected demand for equipment designed for these processes could negatively impact our revenues 
a significant portion of our expected future system and subsystem business in the semiconductor capital equipment market is comprised of products for the fabrication  inspection and metrology of mm semiconductor wafers 
wafer fabrication  inspection and metrology equipment for mm wafers is in an early stage of its adoption  and is expected to be driven by the need for the ability to manufacture more semiconductor chips at lower cost 
the deployment of such equipment requires a significant capital investment by semiconductor manufacturers  and many semiconductor manufacturers have delayed plans to deploy such equipment until market conditions improve 
in addition  certain industry analysts have recently forecasted more conservative capital equipment spending and slower adoption of new technologies by semiconductor manufacturers in future periods 
if the demand for capital equipment for mm wafers does not increase  or increases more slowly than expected  demand for our system and subsystem products will likewise be adversely affected  and our business and results of operations could be harmed significantly 
many of the markets and industries that we serve are subject to rapid technological change  and if we do not introduce new and innovative products or improve our existing products  our business and results of operations will be negatively affected 
many of our markets are characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards  shifting customer needs and new product introductions and enhancements 
products in our markets often become outdated quickly and without warning 
we depend to a significant extent upon our ability to enhance our existing products  to anticipate and address the demands of the marketplace for new and improved technology  either through internal development or by acquisitions  and to be price competitive 
if we or our competitors introduce new or enhanced products  it may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for our existing products 
in addition  because certain of our markets experience severe cyclicality in capital spending  if we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner we may miss market upturns  and may fail to have our products or subsystems designed into our customers products 
we may not be successful in acquiring  developing  manufacturing or marketing new products on a timely or cost effective basis 
if we fail to adequately introduce new  competitive products on a timely basis  our business and results of operations would be harmed 

table of contents we offer products for multiple industries and must face the challenges of supporting the distinct needs of each of the markets we serve 
we offer products for a number of markets  including semiconductor capital equipment  scientific research  aerospace and defense security  life and health sciences and fiber optic communications 
because we operate in multiple markets  we must work constantly to understand the needs  standards and technical requirements of several different industries and must devote significant resources to developing different products for these industries 
product development is costly and time consuming 
many of our products are used by our customers to develop  manufacture and test their own products 
as a result  we must anticipate trends in our customers industries and develop products before our customers products are commercialized 
if we do not accurately predict our customers needs and future activities  we may invest substantial resources in developing products that do not achieve broad market acceptance 
our decision to continue to offer products to a given market or to penetrate new markets is based in part on our judgment of the size  growth rate and other factors that contribute to the attractiveness of a particular market 
if our product offerings in any particular market are not competitive or our analyses of a market are incorrect  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
because the sales cycle for some of our products is long and difficult to predict  and certain of our orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation  we may experience fluctuations in our operating results 
many of our capital equipment  system and subsystem products are complex  and customers for these products require substantial time to make purchase decisions 
these customers often perform  or require us to perform extensive configuration  testing and evaluation of our products before committing to purchasing them 
the sales cycle for our capital equipment  system and subsystem products from initial contact through shipment typically varies  is difficult to predict and can last as long as one year 
the orders comprising our backlog are often subject to cancellation and changes in delivery schedules by our customers without significant penalty 
we have from time to time experienced order rescheduling and cancellations that have caused our revenues in a given period to be materially less than would have been expected based on our backlog at the beginning of the period 
if we experience such rescheduling and or cancellations in the future  our operating results will fluctuate from period to period 
these fluctuations could harm our results of operations and cause our stock price to drop 
if we are delayed in introducing our new products into the marketplace  or if our new products contain defects  our operating results will suffer 
because certain of our products  particularly lasers  are sophisticated and complex  we may experience delays in introducing new products or enhancements to our existing products 
if we do not introduce our new products or enhancements into the marketplace in a timely fashion  our customers may choose to use competitors products 
in addition  because certain of our markets  such as the semiconductor equipment market  are highly cyclical in nature  if we fail to timely introduce new products in advance of an upturn in the market s cycle  we may be foreclosed from selling products to many customers until the next cycle 
as such  our inability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner could cause our business and results of operations to suffer 
in addition  our products may contain defects or undetected errors 
as a result  we could incur substantial expenses in fixing any defects or undetected errors  which could result in damage to our competitive position and harm our business and results of operations 
we face significant risks from doing business in foreign countries 
our business is subject to risks inherent in conducting business internationally 
for the year ended january  which includes spectra physics results of operations for the period after july   the date of acquisition  and for the years ended december  and  our international revenues accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total net sales  with a substantial portion of international sales originating in europe 
we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of total net sales for the foreseeable future  and that  in particular  the proportion of our sales to asian customers will increase as a result of the purchase of spectra physics 
our international operations expose us to various risks  which include 
table of contents adverse changes in the political or economic conditions in countries or regions where we manufacture or sell our products  challenges of administering our business globally  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements including export requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer accounts receivable collection periods  overlapping  differing or more burdensome tax structures  adverse currency fluctuations  differing protection of intellectual property  difficulties in staffing and managing each of our individual foreign operations  increased risk of exposure to terrorist activities  and trade restrictions and licensing requirements 
in addition  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could affect the sales price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets  potentially making our products less price competitive 
such exchange rate fluctuations could also increase the costs and expenses of our foreign operations or require us to modify our current business practices 
if we experience any of the risks associated with international business  our business and results of operations could be significantly harmed 
we face substantial competition  and if we fail to compete effectively  our operating results will suffer 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive  and we believe that competition from both new and existing competitors will increase in the future 
we compete in several specialized markets  against a limited number of companies in each market 
we also face competition in some of our markets from our existing and potential customers who have developed or may develop products that are competitive to ours  or who engage subcontract manufacturers to manufacture subassembly products on their behalf 
many of our existing and potential competitors are more established  enjoy greater name recognition and possess greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we do 
other competitors are small and highly specialized firms that are able to focus on only one aspect of a market 
we compete on the basis of product performance  features  quality  reliability and price and on our ability to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures may force us to reduce our prices  which could negatively affect our operating results 
if we do not respond adequately to competitive challenges  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology  we may lose our competitive advantage 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret protection and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
the steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the patent and trademark law and trade secret protection may not be adequate to deter third party infringement or misappropriation of our patents  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our rights granted under those patents may not provide 
table of contents competitive advantages to us  and the claims under our patent applications may not be allowed 
we have in the past and may in the future be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office  which can demand significant financial and management resources 
the process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications 
moreover  our existing patents or any new patents that may be issued may not be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights in order to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors  which claims could result in costly litigation  the diversion of our technical and management personnel and the assertion of counterclaims by the defendants  including counterclaims asserting invalidity of our patents 
for example  we have notified several manufacturers of semiconductor wafer handling robots and load ports that we believe that they are infringing upon certain of our us patents  and may institute litigation against one or more of such companies in the future 
we will take such actions where we believe that they are of sufficient strategic or economic importance to us to justify the cost 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  intellectual property infringement claims  which could be costly and time consuming to defend 
we have from time to time received communications from third parties alleging that we are infringing certain trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights held by them 
whenever such claims arise  we evaluate their merits 
any claims of infringement brought by third parties could result in protracted and costly litigation  and we could become subject to damages for infringement  or to an injunction preventing us from selling one or more of our products or using one or more of our trademarks 
such claims could also result in the necessity of obtaining a license relating to one or more of our products or current or future technologies  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
any intellectual property litigation and the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or develop substitute technology may divert management s attention from other matters and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the terms of our customer contracts typically require us to indemnify the customer in the event of any claim of infringement brought by a third party based on our products 
any such claims of this kind may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees  our business and results of operations will suffer 
our ability to maintain and grow our business is directly related to the service of our employees in each area of our operations 
our future performance will be directly tied to our ability to hire  train  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
competition for personnel in the technology marketplace is intense  and if we are unable to hire sufficient numbers of employees with the experience and skills we need or to retain our employees  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
our reliance on sole source and limited source suppliers could result in delays in production and distribution of our products 
we obtain some of the materials used to build our systems and subsystems  such as the sheet steel used in some of our vibration isolation tables  and the laser crystals used in certain of our laser products  from single or limited sources due to unique component designs as well as specialized quality and performance requirements needed to manufacture our products 
if our components or raw materials are unavailable in adequate amounts at acceptable quality levels or are unavailable on satisfactory terms  we may be required to purchase them from alternative sources  if available  which could increase our costs and cause delays in the production and distribution of our products 
if we do not obtain comparable replacement components from other sources in a timely manner  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
many of our suppliers require long lead times to deliver the quantities of components that we need 
if we fail to accurately forecast our needs  or if we fail to obtain sufficient quantities of components that we use to manufacture our products  then delays or reductions in production and shipment could occur  which would harm our business and results of operations 

table of contents our products could contain defects  which would increase our costs and harm our business 
certain of our products  especially our laser and automation products  are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance 
further  the manufacture of these products often involves a highly complex and precise process 
as a result of the technical complexity of these products  design defects  changes in our or our suppliers manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could adversely affect our manufacturing yields and product reliability  which could in turn harm our business  operating results  financial condition and customer relationships 
we provide warranties for our products  and we accrue allowances for estimated warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue for the sale of the products 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty 
we establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for our products 
if actual return rates or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required in future periods 
our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions 
in addition  some of our products are combined with products from other suppliers  which may contain defects 
as a result  should problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
if we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems  we could experience  among other things loss of customers  increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses  damage to our brand reputation  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development and engineering resources  or legal action by our customers 
the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products are subject to potential product liability claims which  if successful  could adversely effect our results of operations 
we are exposed to significant risks for product liability claims if personal injury or death results from the use of our products 
we may experience material product liability losses in the future 
we currently maintain insurance against product liability claims 
however  our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on terms that we accept  if at all 
this insurance coverage also may not adequately cover liabilities that we incur 
further  if our products are defective  we may be required to recall or redesign these products 
a successful claim against us that exceeds our insurance coverage level  or any claim or product recall  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of section  we are required to furnish a report by our management each year on our internal control over financial reporting 
this report contains  among other matters  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
this report must also contain a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on management s assessment of such internal controls 
the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso provides a framework for companies to assess and improve their internal control systems 
auditing standard no 
provides the professional standards and related performance guidance for auditors to attest to  and report on  management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting under section management s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting requires management to make subjective judgments and  particularly because section and auditing standard no 
are newly effective  some of the judgments will be in areas that may be open to interpretation and therefore the report may be uniquely difficult to prepare and our auditors may not agree with our assessments 
spectra physics  which now constitutes over half of our business  was formerly a division of a much larger organization with more complex and integrated internal control processes  causing our review of those internal controls over financial reporting to be time consuming and costly 
while we currently believe that the internal control over financial reporting of spectra physics is effective  we are still performing the system and process documentation and evaluation relating to spectra physics needed to comply with section and  as permitted by the securities and exchange commission  will not complete such work until during this process  if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective 
if we are unable to assert each year that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our auditors are unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which would have an adverse effect on our stock price 
in addition  if any such unidentified material weaknesses were to result in fraudulent activity and or a material misstatement or omission in our financial statements  we could suffer losses and be subject to civil and criminal penalties  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our financial results could be adversely affected by changes in the accounting rules governing the recognition of stock based compensation expense 
we measure compensation expense for our employee stock compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
recently  the financial accounting standards board has adopted changes to the accounting rules concerning the recognition of stock option compensation expense which would require us to account for equity compensation under the fair value method of accounting prescribed by sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we provide disclosures of our operating results as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting on a pro forma basis in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
beginning in the third quarter of  we and other companies currently using the intrinsic value method will be required to measure compensation expense using the fair value method  which will adversely affect our results of operations by significantly increasing our equity compensation expense 

table of contents compliance with environmental regulations and potential environmental liabilities could adversely affect our financial results 
our operations are subject to various federal  state and local environmental protection regulations relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
in the united states  we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the environmental protection agency 
comparable authorities are involved in other countries 
some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution  and these permits are subject to modification  renewal and revocation by issuing authorities 
future developments  administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
although we believe that our safety procedures for using  handling  storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by state and federal laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of such an accident involving such materials  we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business 
spectra physics mountain view  california facility is an epa designated superfund site and is subject to a cleanup and abatement order from the california regional water quality control board 
spectra physics  along with several other entities with facilities located near the mountain view  california facility  have been identified as responsible parties with respect to this superfund site  due to releases of hazardous substances during the s and s 
the site is mature  and investigations and remediation efforts have been ongoing for approximately years 
spectra physics and the other responsible parties have entered into a cost sharing agreement covering the costs of remediating the off site groundwater impact 
we have established reserves relating to the estimated cost of these remediation efforts  however our ultimate costs of remediation are difficult to predict 
in addition  while we are not aware of any unresolved property damage or personal injury claims relating to this site  such claims could be made against us in the future 
while thermo electron corporation has agreed in connection with our purchase of spectra physics to indemnify us  subject to certain conditions  for environmental liabilities relating to this site in excess of our reserves  this indemnity may not cover all liabilities relating to this site 
in such event  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
natural disasters or power outages could disrupt or shut down our operations  which would negatively impact our operations 
we are headquartered  and have significant operations  in the state of california and other areas where our operations are susceptible to damages from earthquakes  floods  fire  loss of power or water supplies  or other similar contingencies 
if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss or significant power outages  it could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue  and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility  any of which would harm our business 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by earthquakes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are foreign exchange rates which may generate translation and transaction gains and losses and interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk operating in international markets sometimes involves exposure to volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 

table of contents these changes  if material  may cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
from time to time we use forward exchange contracts to mitigate the risks associated with certain foreign currency transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business  primarily foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
we do not engage in currency speculation 
the forward exchange contracts generally require us to exchange us dollars for foreign currencies at maturity  at rates agreed to at inception of the contracts 
if the counterparties to the exchange contracts aa or a rated banks do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contracted currencies  we could be at risk for any currency related fluctuations 
transaction gains and losses are included in our current net loss in our statement of operations 
net foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to our reported results of operations for the last three years 
our operating income from international operations totaled million in  and our operating loss from international operations was million and million for and  respectively 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of international operations into us dollars affects the year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
we do not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings because we do not believe it is justified by the exposure or the cost 
changes in currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating our future international operating profit include the euro  british pound  japanese yen  canadian dollar and taiwan dollar 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would not have had a material effect on our reported net loss for the year ended january  we believe that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or financing and operating strategies 
interest rate risk the interest rates we pay on certain of our debt instruments are subject to interest rate risk 
our collateralized line of credit bears interest at either the prevailing prime rate  or the prevailing london interbank offered rate plus  at our option 
our investments in marketable securities  which totaled million at january   are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we estimate that a change in the interest rate earned on our investment portfolio or a change in interest rates on our line of credit would not have had a material effect on our net loss for the sensitivity analyses described in the interest rate and foreign exchange discussions above disregard the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category and vice versa
