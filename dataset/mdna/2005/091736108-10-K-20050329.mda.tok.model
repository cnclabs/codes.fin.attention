item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company derives revenue from the sale of its software products  professional consulting  and support and maintenance services 
license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
from time to time the we will enter into extended payment programs with creditworthy customers 
revenue related to extended payment programs is recognized when payment becomes due to the company 
in making our decision to recognize revenue we must make a determination of the credit worthiness of our customer 
this determination involves management judgment and while management believes that it can make reliable judgments  there is no guarantee that the revenue recognized will be collected 
the credit worthiness of customers is further analyzed in connection with our accounts receivable 
we recognize revenue under multiple element arrangements using the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements under the arrangement 
we have established sufficient vsoe for the value of its consulting  training  and other services  based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
accordingly  software license revenues are 
table of contents recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with consulting  training or other services 
our products and the industries in which they compete are not static and the determination of vsoe involves judgment 
management believes that it will continue to be able to use the residual method for recognizing license revenue under multiple element arrangements 
if we were unable to continue to use the residual method  it could affect the timing of revenue recognition and thus the trends that we are currently experiencing 
professional services include custom design and development and training 
we recognize professional services revenue under software development contracts as services are provided for per diem contracts or by using the percentage of completion method of accounting for long term fixed price contracts 
provisions for any estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses become probable 
we had no long term contracts in progress as of december  revenue from end user product sales is recognized upon delivery of the software  net of estimated returns and allowances  if collection is probable 
we estimate returns and allowances based on historical rates and as of december  we do not have a reserve as returns and allowances have been negligible 
if and when a reserve is necessary we would reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns at the time the related revenue is recorded 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of return 
while management believes that it can make reliable estimates  it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates 
we generally warrant that our products will function substantially in accordance with documentation provided to customers for approximately days following initial delivery 
as of december   we had not incurred any expense related to warranty claims 
we estimate reserves based on historical rates and accordingly has not recorded a warranty reserve 
while management believes that it can make reliable estimates  it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates 
please refer to note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition policies 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company tested recorded goodwill attributable to each reporting unit for impairment 
management conducted impairment testing as of december  and determined that the fair value of its reporting units were greater than the carrying values for those units 
though none of the unamortized goodwill was impaired  there can be no assurance that when a future review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
sfas no 
required certain disclosures upon adoption that we have included in note k in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herewith 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on its historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 

table of contents income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within its consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have fully reserved against our tax assets 
the valuation allowance is due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to utilize its deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
the determination of the valuation allowance requires us to make estimates  which we cannot guarantee will prove to be accurate

table of contents forward looking statements except for the historical information contained herein  this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
investors are cautioned that forward looking statements are inherently uncertain 
actual performance and results of operations may differ materially from those projected or suggested in the forward looking statements due to certain risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  market acceptance of the company s products  competition and the timely introduction of new products 
additional information concerning certain risks and uncertainties that would cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or suggested in the forward looking statements is contained in the company s prior filings with the securities and exchange commission  including those risks and uncertainties discussed in our final prospectus  dated october   included as part of the company s registration statement on form s  in the section entitled risk factors 
the forward looking statements contained herein represent our judgment as of the date of this report  and we caution readers not to place undue reliance on such statements 
management undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document 
we are subject to risks common to technology based companies  including dependence on key personnel  rapid technological change  competition from alternative product offerings and larger companies  and challenges to the development and marketing of commercial products and services 
we believe that our future results of operations could be affected by various factors  including the following delays in the development or shipment of our new products or new versions of our existing products  the introduction of competitive products by others  general worldwide economic conditions  inability to attract and retain key personnel  intellectual property disputes  fluctuations in quarterly operating results  changes in accounting rules  and unanticipated changes in tax rates and regulations 
the computer software market is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and adoption of new industry standards 
as the markets in which our products are sold continue to develop and as we enter new markets  we expect to continue to face substantial competition from other software developers and anticipate that additional competitors will enter those markets 
many of our competitors or potential competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing and technical resources than us 
these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and standards or changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than us 
many of these competitors currently market  or can potentially market  their products directly to the ultimate consumers of such products as part of a broader product offering 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these entities 
to compete successfully  we must continue to invest in research and product development and must devote substantial resources to its marketing and sales functions 
there can be no assurance that we will have the necessary capital resources to fund such investment 
also  if we are unable to consistently introduce new products  services  and enhancements  our revenue and operating results are likely to decrease 
any failure by us to anticipate or respond to new technological developments and customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new products  when first released by us  may contain undetected errors that  despite quality control measures employed by us  are discovered only after a product has been integrated into the oem and isv product and used by customers 
such errors may cause delays in product acceptance and may require design modifications which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our business may also be affected by general worldwide economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate 
adverse economic conditions could adversely impact our business in and beyond  resulting in reduced demand for some of our products  increased pressure on the prices for our products and services  and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
to address this issue  we are pursuing a number of strategies to generate revenue growth  including identifying new markets for our products  developing new applications for our technologies  allocating research and development funding to products with high revenue potential  and strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets 
due to limited resources  we may not be able to continue to successfully implement these strategies  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
sales to customers outside the united states represented of our revenue for the year ended december  this revenue does not include revenue derived from products sold into the international market by our domestic oem and isv customers or foreign purchases downloaded from our myfonts 
com web site 
we expect that its international business will continue to account for a significant portion of our future revenue 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore less competitive in foreign markets 
additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have an adverse effect on our future revenue and our results of operations 
in addition  our european business is significant and has historically been negatively affected during the three months ended september th due to the summer closing or slowdown of several european customers 
these seasonal factors have affected  and may continue to affect  our quarterly results of operations 
our performance depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management and key technical employees 
our future results will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel in the software industry is intense 
we rely on competitive compensation packages to recruit and retain highly skilled employees in a competitive environment  but we do not enter into employment agreements with our personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel required to sustain its business 
failure to attract and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we regard our software as proprietary and attempt to protect it with a combination of copyright  patent  trademark  and trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods of protection 
there can be no assurance that these measures will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies 
it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
furthermore  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of unauthorized use of our technologies and products more likely 
we also rely on confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees  and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know how 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 
in connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third party rights  we have been  are currently and may in the future be subject to claims  negotiations or complex  protracted litigation as part of our policy to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  including rights derived from third party licensors 
intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes  we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes 
adverse decisions in such litigation 
table of contents or disputes could have negative results  including subjecting us to significant liabilities  requiring us to seek licenses from others  preventing us from making  using  selling  distributing  or marketing our products and services in the united states or abroad  or causing severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
additionally  although we actively pursue software pirates as part of our enforcement of our intellectual property rights  we do lose revenue due to illegal use of our software 
if piracy activities increase  it may further harm our business 
we have previously experienced quarter to quarter fluctuations in our operating results as a result of a number of factors including the timing of new product introductions  announcements of new products by us  our competitors or our customers  slower than anticipated growth rates of emerging markets  slower adoption of new products and technologies into which our products are incorporated  delays in customer purchases in anticipation of industry developments  and gross margin fluctuations relating to variations in product mix 
furthermore  a significant portion of our expenses are relatively fixed in nature and we may not be able to reduce spending in response to shortfalls or delays in sales 
such shortfalls or delays may result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
moreover  we do not operate with a significant backlog and often tend to realize a disproportionate share of our revenue in the last few weeks of a fiscal quarter  thereby impairing our ability to accurately forecast quarter to quarter sales results 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that in one or more future fiscal quarters our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock which could have a negative effect on our ability to obtain additional funding  if necessary  on terms favorable to us 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa  the securities and exchange commission the sec the public company accounting oversight board the pcaob and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these principles and policies could have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
changes to these rules may have a significant adverse effect on future financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business 
for example  in december  the fasb issued sfas r which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  it is evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expects the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share 
additionally  to avoid the additional expense resulting from having to expense option grants  we may refrain from granting additional options  which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
unanticipated changes in tax rates could adversely affect our future results of operations 
increases in tax rates or changes in how taxes are assessed could increase our tax liabilities  which would negatively affect our business and financial results

as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity

the company s investment portfolio of cash equivalent and short term investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
the company s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of its international subsidiary are almost exclusively conducted in their respective local currencies
