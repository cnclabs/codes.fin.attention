item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements of peoples is presented to provide insight into management s assessment of the financial results 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  as well as the ratios and statistics  contained elsewhere in this form k 
references will be found in this form k to the following transactions that have impacted or will impact peoples results of operations o as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  peoples completed the acquisition of putnam agency  inc putnam on april  and barengo insurance agency  inc barengo on may   collectively  the insurance agency acquisitions 
in addition  peoples bank acquired two full service banking offices in the ashland  kentucky area at the close of business on december  the ashland banking acquisition 
in conjunction with the ashland banking acquisition  peoples bank consolidated two of its existing offices in the ashland area market into other peoples bank offices and closed one of the acquired offices 
in  peoples acquired kentucky bancshares incorporated kentucky bancshares  the holding company of kentucky bank trust  and closed two of peoples bank s existing offices  due to the proximity of the acquired offices 
o in december  peoples sold approximately million of fixed rate securities  consisting primarily of mortgage backed securities purchased in a historically low interest rate environment  and reinvested the net proceeds in other investment securities  primarily variable rate mortgage backed securities the investment portfolio repositioning 
the securities sold were selected because management wanted to shorten the estimated life of the portfolio and expected those securities selected to underperform in a rising rate environment 
while the investment portfolio repositioning is expected to have a minimal impact on short term yields  the new securities have shorter estimated lives and duration and better cash flow characteristics in a rising rate environment than the securities sold  which should improve the overall long term performance of the investment portfolio as interest rates return to more historic levels 
o in december  peoples bank sold its existing credit card portfolio to inficorp holdings  inc inficorp 
in addition to the sale  peoples bank and inficorp entered into a joint marketing agreement to serve the credit card needs of peoples customers and prospective customers 
o in december  peoples sold million of mortgage backed investment securities due to the high rate of prepayments on those securities and the corresponding downward pressure on yields from accelerated amortization of bond premiums 
peoples reinvested the proceeds from the sales into other mortgage backed securities that were anticipated to produce a higher yield with estimated lives similar to those of the securities that were sold collectively  the investment portfolio restructuring 
approximately million of the reinvestment settled in late december and the remaining reinvestment of approximately million settled in late january o on december   peoples prepaid million of long term  convertible rate borrowings from the federal home loan bank fhlb and reborrowed the funds using a short term  repurchase agreement advance collectively  the long term debt restructuring 
peoples incurred prepayment penalties totaling million as part of this transaction 
the prepaid borrowings had a weighted average rate of and weighted average remaining maturity of years 
the new short term advance had a significantly lower initial interest rate  yet has somewhat similar interest rate sensitivity characteristics in a rising interest rate environment 
o on december   peoples bancorp announced the authorization to repurchase up to  or approximately  of peoples bancorp s outstanding common shares in from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
on august   peoples bancorp announced the authorization to repurchase an additional  shares  or approximately  of peoples bancorp s outstanding common shares in from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions collectively  the stock repurchase program 
the repurchased common shares are held as treasury shares and are anticipated to be used for future exercises of stock options granted under peoples stock option plans  issuances of common shares for peoples bancorp s deferred compensation plans  and other general corporate purposes 
peoples bancorp repurchased  common shares or of the total authorized under the stock repurchase program  at an average price of 
the stock repurchase program expired on december  o on december   peoples bancorp announced the authorization to repurchase up to  or approximately  of peoples bancorp s outstanding common shares in from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions the stock repurchase program 
any repurchased common shares will be held as treasury shares and are anticipated to be used for future exercises of stock options granted under peoples stock option plans  future issuances of common shares in connection with peoples deferred compensation plans  and other general corporate purposes 
through february   peoples bancorp had repurchased a total of  common shares or of the total authorized under the stock repurchase program  at an average price of per share 
the impact of these transactions  where significant  is discussed in the applicable sections of this management s discussion and analysis 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of peoples conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap and to general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of peoples consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis 
income recognition interest income on loans and investment securities is recognized by methods that result in level rates of return on principal amounts outstanding  including yield adjustments resulting from the amortization of loan costs and premiums on investment securities and accretion of loan fees and discounts on investment securities 
since mortgage backed securities comprise a sizable portion of peoples investment portfolio  a significant increase in principal payments on those securities negatively impacts interest income due to the corresponding acceleration of premium amortization 
in the event management believes collection of all or a portion of contractual interest on a loan has become doubtful  which generally occurs after the loan is days past due  peoples discontinues the accrual of interest 
in addition  previously accrued interest deemed uncollectible that was recognized in income in the current year is reversed  while amounts recognized in income in the prior year are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only if principal recovery is reasonably assured 
a nonaccrual loan is restored to accrual status when it is brought current or has performed in accordance with contractual terms for a reasonable period of time  and the collectibility of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer considered doubtful 
allowance for loan losses in general  determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates by management 
peoples maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses based on a quarterly analysis of the portfolio 
this formal analysis determines an appropriate level and allocation of the allowance for loan losses among loan types and resulting provision for loan losses by considering factors affecting losses  including specific losses  levels and trends in impaired and nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  current national and local economic conditions  volume  growth and composition of the portfolio  regulatory guidance and other relevant factors 
management continually monitors the loan portfolio through its loan review department and loan loss committee to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance 
the provision could increase or decrease each quarter based upon the results of management s formal analysis 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses for the various loan types represents management s estimate of expected losses from existing loans based upon specific allocations for individual lending relationships and historical loss experience for each category of homogeneous loans 
the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation requires management to make estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans  which consists primarily of nonaccrual and restructured loans 
while allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans  the allowance is available for all loan losses 
individual loan reviews are based upon specific quantitative and qualitative criteria  including the size of the loan  loan quality ratings  value of collateral  repayment ability of borrowers  and historical experience factors 
the historical experience factors utilized for individual loan reviews are based upon past loss experience  known trends in losses and delinquencies  the growth of loans in particular markets and industries  and known changes in economic conditions in the particular lending markets 
allowances for homogeneous loans such as residential mortgage loans  personal loans  etc 
are evaluated based upon historical loss experience  trends in losses and delinquencies  growth of loans in particular markets  and known changes in economic conditions in each lending market 
consistent with the evaluation of allowances for homogenous loans  allowances relating to the overdraft privilege program are based upon management s monthly analysis of accounts in the program 
this analysis considers factors that could affect losses on existing accounts  including historical loss experience and length of overdraft 
there can be no assurance the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses  but management believes the allowance for loan losses of million at december   is adequate to provide for probable losses from existing loans based on information currently available 
while management uses available information to provide for loan losses  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio  and the need for future additions to the allowance  will be based on changes in economic conditions and other relevant factors 
as such  adverse changes in economic activity could reduce cash flows for both commercial and individual borrowers  which would likely cause peoples to experience increases in problem assets  delinquencies and losses on loans 
investment securities investment securities are initially recorded at cost  which includes premiums and discounts if purchased at other than par or face value 
peoples amortizes premiums and accretes discounts as an adjustment to interest income over the estimated life of the security 
the cost of investment securities sold  and any resulting gain or loss  is based on the specific identification method 
management determines the appropriate classification of investment securities at the time of purchase 
held to maturity securities are those securities that peoples has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost 
available for sale securities are those securities that would be available to be sold in the future in response to peoples liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates  and asset liability management strategies  among other considerations 
available for sale securities are reported at estimated fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income taxes 
trading securities are those securities bought and held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term 
trading securities are reported at fair value  with holding gains and losses recognized in earnings 
presently  peoples classifies its entire investment portfolio as available for sale 
as a result  both the investment and equity sections of peoples balance sheet are more sensitive to changes in the overall market value of the investment portfolio  due to changes in market interest rates  investor confidence and other factors affecting market values  than if the investment portfolio was classified as held to maturity 
while temporary changes in the market value of available for sale securities are not recognized in earnings  a decline in fair value below amortized cost deemed to be other than temporary results in an adjustment to the cost basis of the investment  with a corresponding loss charged against earnings 
management systematically evaluates peoples investment securities for other than temporary declines in estimated fair value on a quarterly basis 
this analysis requires management to consider various factors in order to determine if a decline in estimated fair value is temporary or other than temporary 
these factors include duration and magnitude of the decline in value  the financial condition of the issuer  and peoples ability and intent to continue holding the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
at december   management determined an investment in fannie mae preferred stock was other than temporarily impaired  resulting in an impairment charge of  or  after tax 
there were no other investment securities identified by management to be other than temporarily impaired 
if investments decline in fair value due to adverse changes in the financial markets  additional charges to income could occur in future periods 
goodwill and other intangible assets over the past several years  peoples has grown through mergers and acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  peoples is required to allocate the cost of an acquired company to the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
at december   peoples had million of identifiable intangible assets acquired in acquisitions  subject to amortization  and million of goodwill  not subject to periodic amortization 
the determination of fair value and subsequent allocation of the cost of an acquired company generally involves management making estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
in addition  the valuation and amortization of intangible assets representing the present value of future net income to be earned from customers commonly referred to as customer relationship intangibles or core deposit intangibles requires significant judgment and the use of estimates by management 
while management feels the assumptions and variables used to value recent acquisitions were reasonable  the use of different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce materially different results 
customer relationship intangibles are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the method of amortization should reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up 
since peoples acquired customer relationships are subject to routine customer attrition  the relationships are more likely to produce greater benefits in the near term than in the long term  which typically supports the use of an accelerated method of amortization for the related intangible assets 
management is required to evaluate the useful life of customer relationship intangibles to determine if events or circumstances warrant a change in the estimated life 
should management determine in future periods the estimated life of any intangible asset is shorter than originally estimated  peoples would adjust the amortization of that asset  which could increase future amortization expense 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
goodwill recorded by peoples in connection with its acquisitions relates to the inherent value in the businesses acquired and this value is dependent upon peoples ability to provide quality  cost effective services in a competitive market place 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
peoples has reviewed its recorded goodwill and concluded that the recorded value of goodwill was not impaired as of december  however  future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and re evaluate goodwill 
if such re evaluation indicated impairment  peoples would recognize the loss  if any 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material  adverse impact on peoples financial condition and results of operations 
results of operation overview of the income statement in  peoples net income was  or per diluted share  up from  or per diluted share  a year ago 
enhanced non interest revenues of  more than offset the increase in non interest expense of  and the  decline in net interest income 
return on average equity improved to in  from a year ago  while return on average assets was and in and  respectively 
balance sheet restructuring and other charges negatively impacted reported earnings in both and in december  peoples recorded a loss on sale of securities totaling  or  after tax as part of the investment portfolio repositioning  a write down of   after tax on real estate values of banking offices consolidated in conjunction with the ashland banking acquisition and an other than temporary impairment charge of  or  after tax on an investment in fannie mae fnma preferred stock 
the aggregate impact of these transactions resulted in a charge to expense of  or  after tax in comparatively  the long term debt restructuring  investment portfolio restructuring and sale of the credit card portfolio in december resulted in a net charge of  or  after tax for the year for the year ended december   net interest income totaled million and net interest margin was compared to million and for the same period in both net interest income and margin were negatively impacted by extremely competitive pricing for loans and deposits  as well as peoples management of its interest rate risk position  which included extending the maturities of funding liabilities resulting in increased interest expense 
other income totaled million  up from million a year ago due primarily to increased insurance commissions of million attributable to the insurance agency acquisitions and deposit account services charges of million 
other income was also impacted by securities transactions and asset disposals  which resulted in a net loss of million in versus million in  as well as the gain of million on the sale of the credit card portfolio in non interest expense was million in versus million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was largely attributable to additional salaries and benefit costs and other operating expenses incurred as a result of recent acquisitions 
excluding the loss from the long term debt restructuring in  non interest expense was up million 
interest income and expense peoples earns interest income from loans  investment securities and short term investments and incurs interest expense on interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income  the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense  remains peoples largest source of revenue 
management periodically adjusts the mix of assets and liabilities  as well as the rates earned or paid on those assets and liabilities  in an attempt to manage and improve net interest income 
however  factors that influence market interest rates  such as interest rate changes by the federal reserve open market committee and peoples competitors  may have a greater impact on net interest income than adjustments made by management 
consequently  a volatile rate environment or extended periods of unusually low or high interest rates can make it extremely difficult to manage net interest margin and income in the short term  much less anticipate and position the balance sheet for future changes 
net interest income totaled  in compared to  a year ago 
interest income totaled  for the year ended december   down compared to last year 
this decrease was due mainly to lower yields attributable to assets repricing downward and competition for quality loans 
interest expense totaled  in versus  in  an decline reflecting peoples lower cost of funds resulting from the prolonged low rate environment and the long term debt restructuring in december peoples earns a portion of its interest income from loans to  and investments issued by  states and political subdivisions 
since these revenues generally are not subject to income taxes  management believes it is more meaningful to analyze net interest income on a fully tax equivalent fte basis  which adjusts interest income by converting tax exempt income to the pre tax equivalent of taxable income using an effective tax rate of 
net interest margin  calculated by dividing fte net interest income by average interest earning assets  serves as an important measurement of the net revenue stream generated by the mix and pricing of peoples earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table details the calculation of fte net interest income and margin for the years ended december dollars in thousands net interest income  as reported    taxable equivalent adjustments    fully tax equivalent net interest income    average earning assets    net interest margin the sustained low interest rate environment has challenged peoples generation of net interest income due to declining asset yields with limited opportunities for similar reduction in peoples cost of funds 
the fte yield on earning assets was in  down from the prior year  while the cost of funds was versus 
while the federal reserve s action to increase rates in the second half of has produced some benefits  intense competition for quality loans and management s efforts to secure longer term funding  which generally have higher rates than short term funds  have offset any improvement in current asset yields 
in the fourth quarter of  net interest margin was compared to for the prior quarter and for the fourth quarter of management remains committed to minimizing the impact of future rate increases on earnings by working to maintain a slightly asset sensitive risk position 
net loans comprise the largest portion of peoples earning assets  averaging million in  versus million in with the increase due primarily to internal growth 
since a significant portion of the loan growth involved prime based commercial loan originations  the fte yield on net loans dropped basis points to for the year ended december   from a year ago 
other factors contributing to the lower yield were loans repricing downward in the low rate environment and the impact from the sale of the credit card portfolio in late compared to the third quarter of  average net loans grew million to million in the fourth quarter of  and the fte yield improved to  from in  investment securities averaged million compared to million in  with fte yields of and  respectively 
the decrease in the average balance from a year ago is largely attributable to management using a portion of the principal runoff to manage liquidity  fund loan growth and other corporate purposes 
the reduced yield was due to the low rate environment and related reinvestment of funds at significantly lower rates 
for the quarter ended december   investment securities averaged million versus million for the prior quarter  while the fte yield was and for the same periods  respectively 
management anticipates maintaining  or slightly growing  the investment portfolio in depending on loan growth and other corporate liquidity needs 
peoples interest bearing liabilities averaged billion in compared to billion last year  while the overall cost of funds dropped basis points 
traditional deposits comprise the majority of peoples interest bearing liabilities  averaging million for the year ended december   compared to million in the lower level of deposits was due primarily to intense competition  particularly for certificates of deposit 
the cost of funds from interest bearing deposits was  down from a year ago 
peoples also utilizes a variety of borrowings as other funding sources to complement traditional deposits 
for the year ended december   total borrowed funds averaged million compared to million in this increase was the result of management using various borrowings to fund asset growth and offset declines in interest bearing deposits 
even with this increase  peoples overall cost of borrowed funds dropped to from last year  due in part to the long term debt restructuring 
peoples main source of borrowed funds is short term and long term advances from the fhlb 
short term fhlb borrowings averaged million in compared to million a year ago  with an average cost of and for the same periods  respectively 
long term fhlb borrowings averaged million  with an average cost of  in  versus million a year ago  with an average cost of 
these changes reflect the impact of the long term debt restructuring and management s continued use of fhlb borrowings to fund asset growth and manage interest rate sensitivity  as deemed appropriate 
in the second half of  management has match funded selected three and five year adjustable rate commercial loans using long term fhlb advances with similar amortization and repricing characteristics and continued to extend other debt to lock in rates 
as a result  average long term fhlb advances were million in the fourth quarter of  up from million in the prior quarter  while short term advances averaged million and million for the same periods  respectively 
the average cost of long term fhlb borrowing increased basis points to in the fourth quarter  compared to the prior quarter 
the average cost of short term borrowings was in the fourth quarter  up basis points from the third quarter  reflecting the fhlb rate increases in response to the federal reserve s action 
management expects to continue shifting to longer term borrowings  as appropriate  to lock in rates in anticipation of rising interest rates 
additional information regarding peoples advances from the fhlb can be found later in this discussion under the caption funding sources and notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in  management continued to take steps to position the balance sheet for the expected eventual increase in rates  which has produced some benefits 
however  like most other financial institutions  peoples net interest margin has been negatively affected by intense competition for loans and deposits 
while the basis point increase in rates by the federal reserve has eased some of the net interest income pressures  peoples proactive interest rate risk management  coupled with the lag in repricing of a sizeable portion of peoples variable rate loans and flattening yield curve  limits any short term improvement 
management believes additional interest rate increases could cause net interest income to increase modestly based on peoples interest rate risk position and asset liability simulations at december  even though management continues to focus on minimizing the impact of future rate changes on earnings  peoples net interest margin and income remain difficult to predict  and to manage  since changes in market interest rates and the timing of these changes remain uncertain 
provision for loan losses peoples provision for loan losses was  in  down from  in the prior year 
the lower overall provision was the result of peoples quarterly analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and is directionally consistent with peoples continued strong asset quality and lower level of loan delinquencies 
a portion of the provision relates to the overdraft privilege program  which totaled  in  compared to  in when expressed as a percentage of average loans  the provision was in compared to in management believes the provisions were appropriate for the overall quality  inherent risk and volume concentrations of peoples loan portfolio 
future provisions will continue to be based on management s quarterly procedural discipline described in the critical accounting policies section of this discussion 
gains and or losses on securities transactions in  peoples recognized a net loss of  on investment securities transactions compared to  a year ago 
the net loss in is largely the result of the investment portfolio repositioning during the fourth quarter  coupled with the  other than temporary impairment charge on fnma preferred stock 
the net loss in was attributable to the investment portfolio restructuring implemented during the fourth quarter 
non interest income peoples generates non interest income from six primary sources deposit account service charges  fiduciary activities  investment and insurance commissions  electronic banking e banking  mortgage banking and business owned life insurance boli 
in  non interest income was  up  or from  a year ago 
excluding losses on securities transactions  non interest income was  in compared to  an increase of  or 
the insurance agency acquisitions generated gross revenue of million in  accounting for most of the increase 
these revenues  coupled with enhanced deposit account service charges and boli income  were the primary reasons for the increased non interest income 
peoples largest source of non interest revenue remains service charges and other fees on deposit accounts  which are based on the recovery of costs associated with services provided 
for the year ended december   deposit account service charges totaled  up from  in this increase was the result of higher volumes of overdraft and non sufficient funds nsf fees  combined with an overall increase in the number of checking accounts  primarily due to acquisitions 
additionally  peoples increased certain cost recovery fees  including overdraft and nsf fees  effective january  management periodically evaluates its cost recovery fees to ensure the fees are reasonable based on operational costs  as well as similar to fees charged in peoples markets 
the following table details peoples deposit account service charges dollars in thousands overdraft fees    non sufficient funds fees    other fees and charges    total    insurance and investment commissions were  in  up  versus  in this increase was largely the result of higher insurance commissions  primarily from sales of property and casualty insurance  due to the insurance agency acquisitions completed in mid  which generated revenues of  the following table details peoples insurance and investment commissions dollars in thousands property and casualty insurance  life and health insurance brokerage fixed annuities  credit life and a h insurance total    compared to the third quarter  insurance and investment commissions were down to  in the fourth quarter of  from  this decrease is mostly attributable to seasonality of revenues generated by the acquired insurance agencies 
management expects insurance commissions to remain near fourth quarter levels throughout  although peoples ability to retain customer relationship acquired in the insurance agency acquisitions could impact future revenues 
peoples offers various e banking services  including atm and debit cards  direct deposit services and internet banking  as alternative delivery channels to traditional sales offices  for providing services to clients 
for the year ended december   peoples electronic banking services generated revenues of  compared to  a year ago  an increase of  or 
peoples e banking revenues have remained strong due in large part to an increase in the number of debit cards issued to customers and higher volumes of debit card activity 
at december   peoples had  cards issued  with of all eligible deposit accounts having a debit card  compared to  cards and a penetration rate a year ago 
peoples customers used their debit cards to complete million of transactions in  up from million a year ago 
peoples mortgage banking involves the origination and selling of long term  fixed rate real estate loans into the secondary market 
in  mortgage banking produced revenues of  compared to  in the prior year 
the reduction in mortgage banking income from last year reflects the expected decline in real estate loan refinancing activity in response to higher long term rates and the retention of more real estate loan productions 
while it appears future real estate loan refinancing activity will remain light compared to activity  mortgage banking is a key part of peoples long term business strategy 
peoples fiduciary revenues totaled  in  compared to  a year ago 
the kentucky bancshares acquisition added trust assets of about million  and the first full year s impact of associated fiduciary revenues accounted for the increase 
peoples future fiduciary revenues will be influenced by the relative performance of equity markets since a significant portion of fiduciary fees is based on the market value of assets managed 
peoples boli investment enhances operating efficiency by offsetting rising employee benefit costs 
for the year ended december   boli income totaled  compared to  in  a increase as a result of peoples investing an additional million in boli in early management believes boli continues to provide a better vehicle for funding future benefit costs than alternative investment opportunities with similar risk characteristics 
non interest expense for the year ended december   non interest expense totaled  up from  a year ago 
recent acquisitions caused peoples to incur million of additional expense in  primarily salaries and benefits expense  occupancy and equipment costs and intangible amortization  while peoples compliance with new sarbanes oxley regulatory requirements resulted in higher professional fee expense 
non interest expense in was impacted by fhlb advance prepayment fees of million incurred as part of the long term debt restructuring 
excluding the impact of the fhlb fees and intangible amortization  non interest expense was up million in compared to the prior year 
salaries and benefits remain peoples largest operating expense  which is inherent in a service based industry such as financial services 
in  salaries and benefits totaled  up  compared to  in  with million  or over half of the increase  attributable to the insurance agency acquisitions and full year s impact of the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
in addition  rising medical costs and higher sales related compensation accounted for million and million of the increase  respectively  while annual salary adjustments necessary to retain key associates and additional personnel in strategic sales and support positions  were also significant factors for the overall increase 
in the fourth quarter of  salaries and benefits were  virtually unchanged from the third quarter of management continues to explore ways  such as the boli investment  to offset the rising salaries and benefit costs in order to provide a reasonable level of benefits to associates and remain competitive in order to attract and hire talented professionals 
in  net occupancy and equipment expenses were  up  or from  the prior year 
the insurance agency acquisitions caused peoples to incur additional occupancy and equipment expenses of  particularly depreciation expense  representing of the increase  while a full year s impact of the kentucky bancshares acquisition and investments in technology also contributed to the increase 
management believes the continued investment in technology enhances peoples ability to serve clients and satisfy their financial needs  while acquisitions have allowed peoples to expand its customer base for economies of scale 
management continues to monitor capital expenditures to ensure the resources deployed either improve efficiencies or generate additional revenues 
acquisitions also caused an increase in amortization expense of customer relationship intangible assets 
in  intangible amortization was  compared to  in management expects total intangible amortization to be modestly higher in due to a full year s amortization of the customer relationship intangibles acquired in acquisitions during since peoples uses an accelerated method of amortization for these intangibles  amortization expense will be lower in subsequent years based on the intangible assets at december  for the year ended december   data processing and software costs totaled  up from  a year ago 
the higher level of data processing and software costs was attributable to an increase in software licensing fees for the additional office locations and users of key software packages  as well as amortization of peoples million investment in customer relationship management crm and profitability systems implemented in late  the majority of which was software related costs 
while the crm profitability investment has increased operating expenses  these new systems and processes will be a strategic part of peoples sales and marketing efforts for many years and are part of management s long term focus to build the best process to grow revenues and develop profitable customer relationships 
professional fees  which include fees for accounting  legal and other professional services  totaled  in  compared to  in professional fees were impacted by costs associated with peoples compliance with new reporting requirements mandated by the sarbanes oxley act  which apply to all public companies 
these increased costs were partially offset by the expiration of a consulting contract relating to the overdraft privilege program at the end of the first quarter of from april through march  peoples paid consulting fees  which were based on a percentage of the net improvement in overdraft fee income  to the firm that assisted with the implementation of the overdraft privilege program 
in  these fees totaled  compared to  in peoples bankcard costs  which consist primarily of debit card and atm processing fees  were  in versus  in this increase was largely the result of peoples increased customer base and additional cards issued during  coupled with customers using the atm and debit cards to complete more of their transactions 
peoples is subject to various state franchise taxes  which are based largely on peoples bank s equity at year end 
for the year ended december   franchise taxes totaled  up from  for the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to additional equity at peoples bank resulting from the kentucky bancshares acquisition and a million capital contribution from peoples bancorp in early despite the increased franchise taxes  management believes peoples bank s stronger capital level positions peoples for strategic growth 
in addition  management regularly evaluates the capital position of peoples other direct and indirect subsidiaries and seeks to maximize peoples consolidated capital position through allocation of capital  which is intended to enhance profitability and shareholder value 
the non interest leverage ratio serves as a measurement of peoples efficiency for management and is one of the key performance indicators for peoples incentive compensation plan for senior management and certain other associates 
the non interest leverage ratio is defined as non interest income as a percentage of operating expenses  excluding gains and losses on securities transactions  asset disposals  early debt extinguishment and sale of the credit card portfolio  as well as intangible asset amortization 
the followings details the components of the non interest leverage ratio calculation dollars in thousands total other income  as reported    add loss on asset disposals loss on securities transactions   deduct recovery of loss on sale of other real estate owned gain on securities transactions gain on sale of credit card portfolio  adjusted total other income    total other expense  as reported    add gain on early debt extinguishment deduct amortization of other intangible assets   loss on early debt extinguishment  adjusted total other expense    non interest leverage ratio return on equity in  peoples return on average equity roe was versus for the same period last year 
management uses roe to evaluate peoples long term performance 
however  management believes earnings per share eps serves as a more meaningful measurement of short term performance due to the volatility that can occur in equity from changes in the estimated fair values of peoples investment portfolio 
return on assets return on average assets roa was in compared to a year ago 
in recent years  peoples primary focus has shifted to eps enhancement and roe while reducing the emphasis on roa as a key performance indicator 
however  management continues to monitor roa and considers it a measurement of peoples asset utilization 
income tax expense in  peoples effective income tax rate was  unchanged from a year ago  due largely to tax advantaged income comprising a similar portion of peoples income before taxes 
peoples continues to make tax advantaged investments in order to manage its effective tax rate and overall tax burden 
at december   the amount of tax advantaged investments totaled million compared to million at december  depending on economic and regulatory conditions  peoples may make additional investments in various tax credit pools and other tax advantaged assets 
financial condition overview of balance sheet at december   total assets were billion compared to billion at year end  an increase of million which is attributable to loan growth  as well as recent acquisitions 
gross loans grew million or to billion at december   from million at december   a result of peoples bank acquiring million of loans in the ashland banking acquisition and internal loan generations of million 
investment securities totaled million at december  versus million at year end total liabilities were billion at december   compared to billion at year end  an increase of million 
at december   deposits totaled billion  up million from the prior year end  while borrowed funds used to fund asset growth totaled million  up million from million at december  stockholders equity totaled million at december   versus million at december   an increase of million 
this increase is largely due to the equity issued in conjunction with the insurance agency acquisitions 
cash and cash equivalents peoples considers cash and cash equivalents to consist of federal funds sold  cash and balances due from banks  interest bearing balances in other institutions and other short term investments that are readily liquid 
the amount of cash and cash equivalents fluctuates on a daily basis due to customer activity and peoples liquidity needs 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  down million or from million at december  this decrease is attributable to a million reduction in federal funds sold since year end  of which million was consumed by the boli investment in early since september   cash and cash equivalents decreased million  with the million reduction in federal funds sold accounting for most of the decline 
cash and balances due from banks comprised the largest portion of peoples cash and cash equivalents at december   totaling million 
since year end  the amount of cash and balances due from banks grew million or 
these changes are due to normal daily fluctuations in the amount of items in process of collection and cash on hand caused by customer activity 
management believes the current balance of cash and cash equivalents  along with the availability of other funding sources  will allow peoples to meet cash obligations  special needs and off balance sheet commitments  such as unfunded loan commitments  undrawn lines of credit  construction loans and letters of credit  as they come due 
peoples will actively manage the principal runoff from the investment and loan portfolios and seek to reinvest those funds appropriately  based on loan demand and investment opportunities  while maintaining adequate liquidity 
further information regarding peoples liquidity can be found later in this discussion under interest rate sensitivity and liquidity 
investment securities at december   the amortized cost of peoples investment securities totaled million compared to million at year end  while the fair market value of the investment portfolio was million at december   down from million at december  the difference in amortized cost and market value at december   resulted in unrealized appreciation in the investment portfolio of million and a corresponding increase in peoples equity of million  net of deferred taxes 
in comparison  the difference in amortized cost and market value at december   resulted in unrealized appreciation of million and an increase in equity of million  net of deferred taxes 
overall  the composition of peoples investment portfolio at december   was comparable to recent periods 
peoples investment in mortgage backed securities decreased compared to year end due primarily to management using the principal runoff from the investment portfolio to fund loan growth  the million boli investment and other corporate purposes during additional information regarding the composition of the investment portfolio can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
management monitors the earnings performance and liquidity of the investment portfolio on a regular basis through asset liability committee alco meetings 
the alco also monitors net interest income  sets deposit pricing and maturity guidelines  and manages peoples interest rate risk 
through active management of the balance sheet and investment portfolio  peoples seeks to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy depositor demand  other company liquidity requirements and various credit needs of its customers 
loans peoples bank originates various types of loans  including commercial  financial and agricultural loans commercial loans  real estate loans and consumer loans  focusing primarily on lending opportunities in central and southeastern ohio  northwestern west virginia  and northeastern kentucky markets 
at december   gross loans totaled billion  up million or compared to year end the majority of this growth is attributable to internal loan originations of million  with growth primarily occurring in commercial real estate loans 
peoples bank also acquired million of loans  primarily residential real estate loans  in the ashland banking acquisition 
commercial loans  including loans secured by commercial real estate  represent the largest portion of peoples total loan portfolio 
at december   commercial loan balances were million  or of total loans  up million or from million  or of total loans  at year end nearly all of this increase is attributable to internally generated growth from lending opportunities within peoples existing markets 
in addition  peoples bank acquired commercial loans of million in the ashland banking acquisition 
the portion of commercial loan balances secured by commercial real estate  excluding construction loans  totaled million  or of total loans  at december   versus million  or of total loans  at december  future commercial lending activities will be dependent on economic and related conditions  such as general demand for loans in peoples primary markets  interest rates offered by peoples and normal underwriting requirements 
in addition to in market opportunities  peoples will continue to lend selectively to creditworthy customers outside its primary markets 
while commercial loans comprise the largest portion of peoples loan portfolio  generating residential real estate loans remains a major focus of peoples lending efforts  whether the loans are ultimately sold into the secondary market or retained on peoples balance sheet 
at december   real estate loans  which include construction loans but exclude loans secured by commercial real estate  totaled million compared to million at december   an increase of million or 
excluding loans acquired in the ashland banking acquisition  total real estate loans were up million or primarily attributable to increased construction loans 
real estate loans comprised of peoples total loan portfolio at december   versus at year end included in real estate loans are home equity credit line balances of million at december   versus million at december   with the ashland banking acquisition accounting for million of the increase 
the remaining increase in home equity credit line balances is attributable to a shift in client preference for home equity loans over more traditional consumer loans  due in part to peoples marketing and sales efforts 
growth of real estate loan balances in recent periods has been impacted by customer demand for long term  fixed rate mortgages  which peoples generally sells to the secondary market with servicing rights retained 
in  peoples originated long term  fixed rate mortgage loans  with total loan amounts of million  versus loans  with total loan amounts of million  in this decrease reflects the slowdown in refinancing activity for traditional home lending 
at december   peoples was servicing million of real estate loans previously sold to the secondary market compared to million at year end in addition  peoples had million of fixed rate real estate loans held for sale to the secondary market at december  management anticipates selling these loans during the first quarter of consumer loans decreased million or since year end  totaling million at december  the indirect lending area represented a significant portion of peoples consumer loans  with balances of million and million at december  and  respectively 
strong competition for loans  particularly automobile loans  as well as availability of alternative credit products  such as home equity credit lines  have challenged the performance and growth of peoples consumer loan portfolio 
regardless of management s desire to maintain  or even grow  consumer loan balances  peoples commitment to quality loan origination based on sound underwriting practices and appropriate loan pricing discipline remains the paramount objective 
loan concentration peoples largest concentration of commercial loans are credits to lodging and lodging related companies  which comprised approximately of peoples outstanding commercial loans at year end  compared to at december  loans to assisted living facilities and nursing homes also represented a significant portion of peoples commercial loans  comprising of peoples outstanding commercial loans at december   versus at year end these lending opportunities have arisen due to the growth of these industries in markets served by peoples or contiguous areas  as well as sales associates efforts to develop other lending relationships 
management believes peoples loans to lodging and lodging related companies  as well as loans to assisted living facilities and nursing homes  do not pose abnormal risk when compared to risk assumed in other types of lending since these credits have been subjected to peoples normal underwriting standards  which includes an evaluation of the financial strength  market expertise and experience of the borrowers and principals in these business relationships 
in addition  a sizeable portion of the loans to lodging and lodging related companies is spread over various geographic areas and is guaranteed by principals with substantial net worth 
allowance for loan losses peoples allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   up slightly compared to million at year end when expressed as a percentage of total loans  the allowance was at year end  down from at december   a result of internal loan growth and the acquisition of million of loan balances 
the majority of the loans acquired in the ashland banking acquisition were secured by residential real estate with a lower credit risk profile 
the allowance is allocated among the loan categories based upon the consistent  quarterly procedural discipline described in the critical accounting policies section of this discussion 
however  the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb future loan losses in any loan category 
the following schedule details the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december dollars in thousands percent percent percent allocation of loans allocation of loans allocation of loans of in each of in each of in each allowance category allowance category allowance category for loan to total for loan to total for loan to total losses loans losses loans losses loans commercial    consumer    real estate    overdrafts credit card total    the allowance allocated to commercial loans has increased in recent periods  reflecting the higher credit risk associated with this type of lending and continued growth in this portfolio 
the allowance allocated to the real estate and consumer loan portfolios is based upon peoples allowance methodology for homogeneous pools of loans  which includes a consideration of changes in total balances in those portfolios 
the allowance for credit cards reflects an estimate of the loss from the retained recourse on the business cards included in the credit card portfolio sale 
this credit card recourse expires in the second quarter of additional information regarding peoples credit card recourse can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in  net chargeoffs were down compared to  totaling  versus  this decline was attributable to increased recoveries  while gross chargeoffs were virtually unchanged from the prior year 
net chargeoffs relating to the overdraft privilege program comprised the largest portion of peoples net chargeoffs in  totaling  versus  in consumer loans also comprised a significant portion of net chargeoffs  totaling  and  in and  respectively 
asset quality remains a key focus  as management continues to stress quality rather than growth 
at december   nonperforming assets totaled  or of total assets  versus  or of total assets  at year end this increase was largely the result of a single restructured loan of million in the fourth quarter and peoples reclassifying the net value  totaling  of the banking offices closed as part of the ashland banking acquisition  previously recorded as bank premises  to other real estate owned oreo in anticipation of their eventual sale 
however  management does not expect peoples to incur any losses from these two items in the near term 
in january  peoples sold one of the closed banking properties at a slight gain  reducing the balance of oreo by  a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that peoples will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of potential impaired loan losses is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s contractual effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if foreclosure is probable  impairment loss is measured based on the fair value of the collateral 
at december   the recorded investment in loans that were considered to be impaired was million  of which million were accruing interest  and million were nonaccrual loans 
included in this amount were million of impaired loans for which the related allowance for loan losses was million 
the remaining impaired loan balances do not have a related allocation of the allowance for loan losses because the loans have been previously written down  are well secured  or possess characteristics indicative of the ability to repay the loan 
for the year ended december   peoples average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately million and interest income of  was recognized on impaired loans during the period  representing of peoples total interest income 
funding sources peoples considers a number of sources when evaluating funding needs  including but not limited to deposits  short term borrowings and long term borrowings 
deposits  both interest bearing and non interest bearing  continue to be the most significant source of funds for peoples  totaling billion at december  versus billion at year end at december   borrowed funds totaled million  up million or from million at year end  as a result of an increase in long term borrowings 
non interest bearing deposits serve as a core funding source 
at december   non interest bearing deposit balances totaled million  up million or compared to the prior year end 
the majority of this increase is attributable to peoples efforts to grow non interest bearing deposits and reduce its reliance on high cost funding 
in addition  peoples bank acquired million of non interest bearing deposits in the ashland banking acquisition 
since customer activity can result in significant temporary changes in deposit balances at end of periods  management believes a comparison of average balances to be a more meaningful reflection of the trend in non interest bearing deposits 
in  non interest bearing deposits averaged million versus in  reflecting peoples efforts to increase non interest bearing deposits 
peoples strategies include continued emphasis on core deposit growth in products such as non interest bearing checking accounts 
interest bearing deposits totaled million at december   compared to million at december   a increase 
excluding the million of acquired deposits  total interest bearing deposits declined million  reflecting the intense competition for deposits  particularly certificates of deposits and other high cost funds  during this period of rising interest rates 
the following details peoples interest bearing deposits at december dollars in thousands certificates of deposit    interest bearing transaction accounts    savings accounts    money market deposit accounts    total interest bearing deposits    peoples short term borrowings include overnight repurchase agreements and fhlb advances  while long term borrowings include fhlb advances  a loan from an unrelated financial institution and term repurchase agreements 
advances from the fhlb comprise a significant portion of peoples borrowed funds 
short term fhlb advances are typically variable rate cash management advances used to manage peoples daily liquidity needs and may be repaid  in whole or part  at anytime without a penalty 
peoples also utilizes short term  repo advances ranging in terms from overnight to one year to manage its cost of funds and temporary cash needs 
approximately half of peoples long term fhlb advances are convertible rate advances  with the initial rate fixed for periods ranging from two to four years  depending on the specific advance 
after the initial fixed rate period  these advances are subject to conversion  at the discretion of the fhlb  to a libor based  variable rate product 
peoples has the option to prepay  without penalty  any advance that has been converted or allow the borrowing to reprice 
the balance of the long term fhlb advances are fixed rate advances  both amortizing and non amortizing  designed to help manage its interest rate sensitivity and liquidity 
further information regarding peoples management of interest rate sensitivity can be found later in this discussion under interest rate sensitivity and liquidity 
in addition to fhlb advances  peoples accesses national market repurchase agreements to diversify its funding sources 
at december   wholesale repurchase agreements totaled million versus million at year end this increase is due to peoples using wholesale repurchase agreements to fund asset growth during the year and to mitigate the interest rate risk of some investment security purchases 
peoples current wholesale repurchase agreements range in original terms of two to five years 
the repurchase agreements may not be repaid prior to maturity and must remain sufficiently collateralized during the entire term 
as a result  a decline in the market value of the investment securities associated with these agreements would require peoples to pledge additional investment securities 
capital stockholders equity at december   stockholders equity was million  versus million at december   an increase of million or  attributable to the common shares issued as part of the insurance agency acquisitions  which increased equity million 
peoples earnings  net of dividends paid  of million was almost entirely offset by treasury stock purchases  net of shares reissued  of million 
for the year ended december   peoples paid dividends of million  representing a dividend payout ratio of of earnings  compared to million  and a payout ratio of  a year ago 
while management anticipates peoples continuing its year history of consistent dividend growth in future periods  peoples bancorp s ability to pay dividends on its common shares is largely dependent upon dividends from peoples bank 
in addition  other restrictions and limitations may prohibit peoples from paying dividends even when sufficient cash is available 
further discussion regarding restrictions on peoples ability to pay future dividends can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  as well as the limits on dividends section under item of this form k 
included in peoples equity is accumulated comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes  which consists primarily of the adjustment for the net unrealized holding gains on available for sale securities 
at december   accumulated comprehensive income totaled million versus million at december   a change of million 
since all the investment securities in peoples portfolio are classified as available for sale  both the investment and equity sections of peoples consolidated balance sheet are more sensitive to the changing market values of investments than if the investment portfolio was classified as held to maturity 
at december   peoples had treasury stock totaling million compared to million at year end during  peoples repurchased  common shares or of the total authorized  at an average price of per share  under the stock repurchase program  and  common shares  at an average price of  in conjunction with the deferred compensation plan for directors of peoples and subsidiaries 
during the same period  peoples reissued  of the shares purchased under the stock repurchase program as part of the acquisition of putnam and stock option exercises 
peoples may repurchase additional common shares as authorized under the stock repurchase program 
management uses the tangible capital ratio as one measure of the adequacy of peoples equity 
the ratio  defined as tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets  excludes the balance sheet impact of intangible assets acquired through acquisitions 
at december   peoples tangible capital ratio was compared to at december  the lower ratio compared to the prior year end is the result of an increase in assets and a decline in tangible equity due to intangible assets acquired during through acquisitions 
in addition to monitoring performance through traditional capital measurements ie  dividend payout ratios and roe  peoples has also complied with the capital adequacy standards mandated by the banking industry 
peoples and peoples bank were categorized as well capitalized institutions at december   based on the most recent regulatory notification 
further information regarding peoples and peoples bank s risk based capital ratios can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
interest rate sensitivity and liquidity while peoples is exposed to various business risks  the risks relating to interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are typically the most complex and dynamic and could materially impact future results of operation and financial condition 
the objective of peoples asset liability management alm function is to measure and manage these risks in order to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity and safety 
this objective requires peoples to focus on interest rate risk exposure and adequate liquidity through management of the mix and characteristics of assets and liabilities 
ultimately  the alm function is intended to guide management in the acquisition and disposition of earning assets and selection of appropriate funding sources 
interest rate risk interest rate risk irr is one of the most significant risks for peoples  and the entire financial services industry  primarily arising in the normal course of business of offering a wide array of financial products to its customers  including loans and deposits  and from the complexity and characteristics of its own investment portfolio and borrowed funds 
irr is the potential for economic loss due to future interest rate changes that can impact both the earnings stream as well as market values of financial assets and liabilities 
peoples exposure to irr is due primarily to differences in the maturity  or repricing  of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  other factors  such as prepayments of loans and investment securities or early withdrawal of deposits  can expose peoples to irr and increase interest costs or reduce revenue streams 
peoples has charged the alco with the overall management of peoples balance sheet mix and off balance sheet commitments and hedging transactions related to the management of irr 
the alco consists of peoples chief financial officer  chief executive officer  president and chief lending officer  as well as other members of senior management 
the alco regularly reports to the board of directors 
it is the alco s responsibility to focus on the future by evaluating trends and potential future events  researching alternatives  then recommending and authorizing appropriate courses of action 
to this end  the alco has established an irr management policy that sets the minimum requirements and guidelines for monitoring and managing the level and amount of irr 
the objective of the irr policy is to encourage adherence to sound fundamentals of banking while allowing sufficient flexibility to exercise the creativity and innovation necessary to meet the challenges and opportunities of changing markets 
the ultimate goal of these policies is to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity and safety 
peoples alco relies on different methods of assessing irr  including simulation modeling  to project future net interest income under various interest rate scenarios and to monitor the sensitivity of the net present market value of equity 
the model is based on cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rate of certain assets and liabilities 
the model also includes management projections for activity levels in product lines offered by peoples 
the alco places emphasis on simulation modeling as the most beneficial measurement of irr because it is a dynamic measure 
by employing a simulation process that estimates the impact of potential changes in interest rates on the balance sheet structure and by establishing limits on these estimated changes to net interest income and net market value  the alco is better able to evaluate interest rate risks and their potential impact to earnings and the market value of equity 
the modeling process starts with a base case simulation using the current balance sheet and current interest rates held constant for the next twelve months 
at least two alternative interest rate scenarios  one with higher interest rates and one with lower interest rates  assuming parallel  immediate and sustained changes are also prepared using the same balance sheet structure as the base scenario 
comparisons produced from the simulation data  showing the earnings variance from the base interest rate scenario  illustrate the risks associated with the current balance sheet structure 
additional simulations  when deemed appropriate  are prepared using different interest rate scenarios than those used with the base case simulation and or possible changes in balance sheet structure 
the additional simulations are used to better evaluate risks and highlight opportunities inherent in the modeled balance sheet 
comparisons showing the earnings and equity value variance from the base case are provided to the alco for review and discussion 
the results from these model simulations are evaluated for indications of effectiveness of current irr management strategies 
as part of the evaluation of irr  the alco has established limits on changes in net interest income and the net value of the balance sheet 
the alco limits the decrease in net interest income of peoples to or less from base case for a basis point shift in interest rates measured over a twelve and twenty four month period 
the alco limits the negative impact on net equity to or less given an immediate and sustained basis points shift in interest rates 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities for specified periods of time is known as the gap 
the alco also reviews the gap for specific periods focusing on a one year cumulative gap 
based on historical trends and performance  the alco has determined the ratio of the one year cumulative gap should be within of earning assets at the date of measurement 
results that are outside of any of these limits will prompt a discussion by the alco of appropriate actions  if any  that should be taken 
at december   peoples one year cumulative gap amount was positive of earning assets 
the following table is provided to illustrate the estimated earnings at risk and value at risk positions of peoples  on a pre tax basis  at december  dollars in thousands immediate interest rate estimated estimated increase decrease in increase decrease decrease in economic value of basis points in net interest income equity the interest rate risk analysis shows peoples is asset sensitive  which means that increasing interest rates should favorably impact peoples net interest income while downward moving interest rates should negatively impact net interest income  based on the assumptions used 
however  the variability of cash flows from the investment and loan portfolios continue to have a significant influence on future net interest income and earnings  especially during periods of changing interest rates 
in general  the amount of principal runoff from these portfolios tends to decrease as interest rates increase due to fewer prepayments  limiting the amount of funds which can be reinvested at higher rates  while declining interest rates tend to result in a higher level of funds that must be reinvested at lower rates  due to an increase in prepayments 
the interest rate table also shows peoples is within the established irr policy limits for all simulations and all scenarios for the current period 
peoples has implemented hedge positions to help protect net interest income streams in the event of rising rates  which complements the current irr position 
peoples has an interest rate swap on a million long term  fixed rate borrowing from the federal home loan bank that may convert to a variable rate  at the option of the federal home loan bank 
in addition  the alco may consider additional hedging options  including  but not limited to  the purchase of other interest rate hedge positions  as available and appropriate  that would provide net interest income protection in a rising rate environment 
liquidity in addition to irr management  a primary objective of the alco is the maintenance of a sufficient level of liquidity 
the alco defines liquidity as the ability to meet anticipated and unanticipated operating cash needs  loan demand and deposit withdrawals  without incurring a sustained negative impact on profitability 
the alco s liquidity management policy sets limits on the net liquidity position of peoples and the concentration of non core funding sources  both wholesale funding and brokered deposits 
typically  the main source of liquidity for peoples is deposit growth 
liquidity is also provided by cash generated from earning assets such as maturities  calls  principal payments and net income from loans and investment securities 
in  cash used in financing activities totaled million  primarily treasury stock purchases 
in comparison  in  cash provided by financing activities was million as a result of increased long term borrowings used to fund an investment growth strategy 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in versus million last year  primarily due to lower level of investment securities purchases in when appropriate  peoples takes advantage of external sources of funds  such as advances from the fhlb  national market repurchase agreements  and brokered funds 
these external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that better enable peoples to match funding dates and pricing characteristics with contractual maturity dates and pricing parameters of earning assets 
at december   peoples had available borrowing capacity of approximately million through these external sources and unpledged securities in the investment portfolio of approximately million that can be utilized as an additional source of liquidity 
the net liquidity position of peoples is calculated by subtracting volatile funds from liquid assets 
peoples volatile funds consist primarily of short term growth in deposits  while liquid assets include short term investments and unpledged available for sale securities 
at december   peoples net liquidity position was million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  at december  the decrease in liquidity position was primarily the result of a lower level of liquid assets  due in large part to the reduction in federal funds sold and investment securities 
the liquidity position as of december   was within peoples policy limit of negative of total assets 
off balance sheet activities and contractual obligations peoples routinely engages in activities that involve  to varying degrees  elements of risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements 
these activities are part of peoples normal course of business and include traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments  interest rate contracts  operating leases  long term debt and commitments to make additional capital contributions in low income housing tax credit investments 
traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments are primarily commitments to extend credit  and standby letters of credit 
these activities are necessary to meet the financing needs of customers and could require peoples to make cash payments to third parties in the event certain specified future events occur 
the contractual amounts represent the extent of peoples exposure in these off balance sheet activities 
however  since certain off balance sheet commitments  particularly standby letters of credit  are expected to expire or be only partially used  the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
peoples also enters into interest rate contracts where peoples is required to either receive cash from or pay cash to counter parties depending on changes in interest rates 
peoples utilizes interest rate contracts to help manage the risk of changing interest rates 
interest rate contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
as a result  the amounts recorded on the balance sheet at december   do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid or received under these contracts 
peoples also has commitments to make additional capital contributions in low income housing tax credit funds  consisting of a pool of low income housing projects 
as a limited partner in these funds  peoples receives federal income tax benefits  which assist peoples in managing its overall tax burden 
since the future contributions are conditioned on certain future events occurring  the total amount of delayed equity contributions is not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet at december  further information regarding peoples delayed equity contributions can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in connection with the sale of the credit card portfolio  peoples provided credit recourse on the approximately million of business credit card loans sold to an unrelated third party during the fourth quarter of as a result  peoples is required to reimburse the third party in the event of any customer default  pursuant to the recourse provided on the business credit cards 
at december   the maximum amount of peoples exposure in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers was approximately million 
no loss was incurred by peoples in as a result of this credit card recourse  which expires in the second quarter of management does not anticipate peoples current off balance sheet activities will have a material impact on future results of operations and financial condition based on past experience 
further information regarding peoples financial instruments with off balance sheet risk can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
peoples continues to lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases with terms providing for fixed monthly payments over periods ranging from two to fifteen years 
many of peoples leased facilities are inside retail shopping centers and  as a result  are not available for purchase 
management believes these leased facilities increase peoples visibility within its markets and afford sales associates additional access to current and potential clients 
the following table details peoples future contractual obligations under certain contractual obligations payments due by period less more than than total year years years years long term debt      operating leases    time deposits     total      amounts reflect the minimum principal payments required under peoples long term debt agreements 
effects of inflation on financial statements substantially all of peoples assets relate to banking and are monetary in nature 
as a result  inflation does not impact peoples to the same degree as companies in capital intensive industries in a replacement cost environment 
during a period of rising prices  a net monetary asset position results in a loss in purchasing power and conversely a net monetary liability position results in an increase in purchasing power 
the opposite would be true during a period of decreasing prices 
in the banking industry  typically monetary assets exceed monetary liabilities 
the current monetary policy targeting low levels of inflation has resulted in relatively stable price levels 
therefore  inflation has had little impact on peoples net assets 
future outlook in  peoples results reflect a period of growth  expansion and revenue diversification  as well as continued positioning of the balance sheet for the expected increases in interest rates 
management maintains a positive outlook on peoples ability to grow earnings  as prospects for loan growth and continued strong asset quality  coupled with a full year s impact of acquisitions  should produce better operating results in however  the flattening yield curve causes some concern and emphasizes the need to enhance non interest income through increased cross sales 
peoples capital position  coupled with management s commitment to sound underwriting discipline and peoples solid asset quality  serves as a foundation of strength in the current business environment 
management continues its efforts to position peoples for long term earnings growth in anticipation of a rising interest rate environment  which will pose additional challenges as competition for loans and deposits intensifies 
cost control remains a key focus of management  especially during tougher times of net interest revenue growth 
while peoples implementation of new sarbanes oxley requirements caused an increase in professional fee expense  management does not expect some of these costs to be repeated in  which could result in slightly lower professional fees 
however  the new accounting rules requiring companies to expense stock options will have an impact on expenses in the second half of management estimates the expense will be  to  or approximately per diluted share after tax 
in  management will continue to monitor expenses and explore opportunities to enhance peoples operating efficiency 
one of peoples successes in was strong internal loan growth 
with economic conditions improving in many of peoples markets  management looks to continue growing loans in a disciplined manner that preserves peoples already solid asset quality 
as peoples works to generate new loans  management is evaluating the possibility of selling between and million of long term  fixed rate residential real estate loans acquired in the ashland banking acquisition 
the proceeds from this sale  which is not expected to generate any significant gain or loss  would be used to fund new loans at rates and terms more consistent with peoples mortgage portfolio and interest rate risk parameters 
peoples ability to retain  and even grow  deposits has been challenged by fierce competition for interest bearing deposits  especially certificates of deposits 
in  management will continue to focus on attracting core deposits and adjusting the mix of funding sources as a means of managing peoples overall cost of funds 
as part of this strategy  peoples has introduced a new interest bearing checking product ultimate freedom checking in early this new product offers customers with higher balances attractive rates that are comparable to money market products offered by peoples competitors 
in march  peoples will expand its operations in central ohio with the opening of a loan production office in westerville 
loan production offices have served as an effective means for peoples to enter new markets or expand its presence in existing markets 
central ohio and its vibrant economic conditions have been good for peoples  and the westerville office is expected to provide opportunities for additional growth and complements existing offices in the region 
management s long term goal is to expand to more full service offerings of peoples financial services and develop client relationships in the westerville market 
acquisitions continue to serve as a means of growing and diversifying peoples revenues and decreasing its reliance on margin based revenues 
as expected  the insurance agency acquisitions are having a positive impact on revenues and earnings  while the ashland banking acquisition added many new customers and allowed peoples to streamline its operations in the ashland market 
in  non interest revenues are expected to be slightly higher  due largely to a full year s impact of recent acquisitions 
with strong regulatory capital ratios and an acceptable level of tangible equity to total assets  management believes mergers and acquisitions remain a viable means of expanding peoples operations and customer base 
while peoples has completed several traditional banking and branch acquisitions in recent years  management s evaluation of future acquisitions will also include insurance agency and professional investment services firms 
ultimately  the assessment of potential acquisitions will emphasize opportunities to complement peoples core competencies and strategic intent more than geographic location  size or nature of business 
peoples remains a service oriented company with a sales focus that strives to satisfy clients through a relationship sales process 
through this process  sales associates work to anticipate  uncover  and solve their clients every financial need  from insurance to banking to investment services 
in  management expects earnings catalysts to include loan growth  a full year s impact of recent acquisitions  controlled operating expenses and possible improvement in net interest revenue due to interest rate increases
