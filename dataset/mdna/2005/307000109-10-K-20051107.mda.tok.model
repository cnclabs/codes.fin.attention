subsequent to the company s fiscal year end  hurricane katrina and hurricane rita struck the us gulf coast  impacting numerous stores in the afflicted areas 
the company has property insurance that covers most of its property damage 
since the company s stores are widely dispersed  lost sales due to closed stores are generally limited and are often offset by increased sales in other stores 
therefore  these storms have not had a material impact in the aggregate on the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
the long term impact of these storms is more difficult to forecast 
the potential increase in energy costs over the long term could negatively impact the company and its customers 
however  the resources received by customers from government and private organizations and the funds contributed in the rebuilding effort could positively impact sales 
therefore  the company has not included any impact from these storms in its fiscal outlook

cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal and in both fiscal and fiscal the increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  during fiscal was due primarily to the continuing shift in the merchandise mix of sales to more lower margin consumables and fewer higher margin discretionary goods  increased inventory shrinkage and increased freight costs due to higher fuel expense

in addition  as part of its urban initiative  the company modified its field management structure to increase management presence and the frequency of inspections in urban markets 
the opening of the company s eighth distribution center in marianna  florida  in the second quarter of fiscal positively impacted freight costs by lowering the average distance to the stores from the distribution centers 
increases in productivity and efficiency  such as increased back hauls and optimization and consolidation of inbound routing have also offset some of the cost increases 
however  these savings did not fully offset the impact of higher year over year fuel costs 
the company expects that the opening of the ninth distribution center in rome  new york  during the third quarter of fiscal will positively impact freight costs and continue to offset higher fuel costs 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  in fiscal was unchanged from fiscal the percentage was favorably impacted by a change in the treatment of certain vendor allowances in conformity with an accounting pronouncement  as well as from lower merchandise markdowns

each of these percentages was negatively impacted by the lower than planned increase in sales in comparable stores 
a cumulative charge to correct property tax accruals on leased properties and the incremental costs of three additional advertising circulars also impacted this percentage approximately of net sales  but these amounts were offset by a reduction in bonus costs as the company did not reach the earnings target necessary for payment of management bonuses 
in addition  most other costs  as a percentage of net sales  were negatively impacted by the lower than planned increase in sales in comparable stores 
the increase in sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  in fiscal was due primarily to below plan sales which negatively impacted the company s ability to leverage its cost structure 
in addition  the effect of the change in treatment of certain vendor allowances negatively impacted expense leverage 
continued increases in insurance costs  primarily workers compensation  and increased rent expense also adversely impacted expense leverage 
the increase in sg a expense  as a percentage of net sales  for fiscal was offset slightly by a reduction in bonus costs as the company did not reach the earnings target necessary for payment of full bonuses

the company had no borrowings against these facilities during fiscal merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal were higher than at the end of fiscal this increase was due primarily to additional inventory for net new stores 
inventory on a per store basis at the end of fiscal was higher than at the end of fiscal  excluding merchandise in transit to the distribution centers 
all of this increase was in hardline merchandise  which increased approximately per store  reflecting the early receipt of holiday merchandise and new inventory associated with the cooler program 
average softline merchandise inventory per store  excluding merchandise in transit to the distribution centers  decreased approximately as the company aggressively managed these items to prevent an inventory buildup 
the increase in capital expenditures to million in fiscal from million in fiscal was due primarily to greater distribution center construction expenditures

critical accounting policies management believes the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories inventories are valued using the retail method  based on retail prices less markon percentages  which approximates the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
the company records adjustments to inventory through cost of goods sold when retail price reductions  or markdowns  are taken against on hand inventory 
in addition  management makes estimates and judgments regarding  among other things  initial markups  markdowns  future demand for specific product categories and market conditions  all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation 
if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional markdowns may be necessary 
this risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal goods 
the company also provides for estimated inventory losses for damaged  lost or stolen inventory for the period from the physical inventory to the financial statement date 
these estimates are based on historical experience and other factors 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost 
depreciation for financial reporting purposes is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
for leasehold improvements  this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease generally five years or the asset s useful economic life 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the company generally assigns no salvage value to property and equipment 
property and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
historically  impairment losses on fixed assets have not been material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
insurance liabilities the company is primarily self insured for health care  property loss  workers compensation and general liability costs 
these costs are significant primarily due to the large number of the company s retail locations and employees 
because the nature of these claims is such that there can be a significant lag from the incurrence of the claim which is when the expense is accrued until payment is made  the percentage increase in the accrual can be much more pronounced than the percentage increase in the expense 
the company s self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported  less amounts paid against such claims  and are not discounted 
management reviews current and historical claims data in developing its estimates 
the company also uses information provided by outside actuaries with respect to workers compensation and general liability claims 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends  then the company may be required to record additional expense or a reduction to expense which could be material to the reported financial condition and results of operations 
lease accounting the company leases substantially all of its store properties and accounts for store leases in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases 
for purposes of recognizing incentives  premiums and minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over terms of the leases  the company uses the date of initial possession to begin amortization  which is generally when the company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation of intended use 
for tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays  the company records a deferred rent liability at the inception of the lease term and amortizes the deferred rent over the terms of the leases as reductions to rent expense on the consolidated statements of income
