item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the forward looking statements included below the table of contents  selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
overview prudential financial has two classes of common stock outstanding 
the common stock  which is publicly traded nyse pru  reflects the performance of the financial services businesses  while the class b stock  which was issued through a private placement and does not trade on any exchange  reflects the performance of the closed block business 
the financial services businesses and the closed block business are discussed below 
financial services businesses our financial services businesses consist of three operating divisions  which together encompass seven segments  and our corporate and other operations 
the insurance division consists of our individual life and annuities and group insurance segments 
the investment division consists of our asset management  financial advisory  and retirement segments 
in the first quarter of  we combined the former other asset management segment with the former investment management segment to form the asset management segment 
the international insurance and investments division consists of our international insurance and international investments segments 
our corporate and other operations include our real estate and relocation services business  as well as corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments 
corporate and other operations also include businesses that have been or will be divested and businesses that we have placed in wind down status 
we attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing used by each segment  excluding financing costs associated with corporate debt 
the net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of equity that management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment 
we seek growth internally and through acquisitions  joint ventures or other forms of business combinations or investments 
our principal acquisition focus is in our current business lines  both domestic and international 
closed block business in connection with the demutualization  we ceased offering domestic participating products 
the liabilities for our domestic in force participating products were segregated  together with assets  in a regulatory mechanism referred to as the closed block 
the closed block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations for future policy dividends after demutualization of holders of participating individual life insurance policies and annuities included in the closed block by allocating assets that will be used exclusively for payment of benefits  including policyholder dividends  expenses and taxes with respect to these products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the closed block 
we selected the amount of closed block assets so that the closed block assets initially had a lower book value than the closed block liabilities 
we expect that the closed block assets will generate sufficient cash flow  together with anticipated 
table of contents revenues from the closed block policies  over the life of the closed block to fund payments of all expenses  taxes  and policyholder benefits to be paid to  and the reasonable dividend expectations of  holders of the closed block policies 
we also segregated for accounting purposes the assets that we need to hold outside the closed block to meet capital requirements related to the closed block policies 
no policies sold after demutualization will be added to the closed block  and its in force business is expected to ultimately decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full 
we also expect the proportion of our business represented by the closed block to decline as we grow other businesses 
concurrently with our demutualization  prudential holdings  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential financial that owns the capital stock of prudential insurance  issued billion in senior secured notes  which we refer to as the ihc debt 
the net proceeds from the issuances of the class b stock and ihc debt  except for million used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a portion of the bond insurance cost associated with that debt  were allocated to the financial services businesses 
however  we expect that the ihc debt will be serviced by the net cash flows of the closed block business over time  and we include interest expenses associated with the ihc debt when we report results of the closed block business 
the closed block business consists principally of the closed block  assets that we must hold outside the closed block to meet capital requirements related to the closed block policies  invested assets held outside the closed block that represent the difference between the closed block assets and closed block liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve  deferred policy acquisition costs related to closed block policies  the principal amount of the ihc debt and related hedging activities  and certain other related assets and liabilities 
revenues and expenses we earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums  mortality  expense  and asset management fees from insurance and investment products  and investment of general account and other funds 
we earn premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance and group life and disability insurance 
we earn mortality  expense  and asset management fees from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities 
we also earn asset management and administrative fees from the distribution  servicing and management of mutual funds  retirement products and other asset management products and services 
our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided  general business expenses  dividends to policyholders  commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products we sell and interest credited on general account liabilities 
profitability our profitability depends principally on our ability to price and manage risk on insurance products  our ability to attract and retain customer assets and our ability to manage expenses 
specific drivers of our profitability include our ability to manufacture and distribute products and services and to introduce new products that gain market acceptance on a timely basis  our ability to price our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring customers and administering those products  our mortality and morbidity experience on individual and group life insurance  annuity and group disability insurance products  our persistency experience  which affects our ability to recover the cost of acquiring new business over the lives of the contracts  our cost of administering insurance contracts and providing asset management products and services  our returns on invested assets  net of the amounts we credit to policyholders accounts  our ability to earn commissions and fees from the distribution and servicing of mutual funds  annuities  retirement products  and other investment products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the expense of providing such services  the performance of our investment in wachovia securities financial holdings  llc  or wachovia securities  
table of contents the amount of our assets under management and changes in their fair value  which affect the amount of asset management fees we receive  our ability to generate favorable investment results through asset liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocation  and our ability to maintain our credit and financial strength ratings 
in addition  factors such as regulation  competition  interest rates  taxes  foreign exchange rates  securities market conditions and general economic conditions affect our profitability 
in some of our product lines  particularly those in the closed block business  we share experience on mortality  morbidity  persistency and investment results with our customers  which can offset the impact of these factors on our profitability from those products 
historically  the participating products included in the closed block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses 
as we have ceased offering domestic participating products  we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age  and we grow other businesses 
however  the relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years 
our common stock reflects the performance of our financial services businesses  but there can be no assurance that the market value of the common stock will reflect solely the performance of these businesses 
executive summary prudential financial  one of the largest financial services firms in the us  offers clients a wide array of financial products and services  including life insurance  mutual funds  annuities  pension and retirement related services and administration  asset management  banking and trust services  real estate brokerage and relocation services  and  through a joint venture  securities brokerage 
we offer these products and services through one of the largest distribution networks in the financial services industry 
significant developments and events in reflect our continued efforts to redeploy capital effectively to seek enhanced returns 
these developments included the acquisition  on april   of the retirement business of cigna corporation for cash consideration of billion 
the continuation of our share repurchase program 
in  we repurchased million shares of common stock at a total cost of billion and are authorized  under a new stock repurchase program authorized by prudential financial s board of directors in november  to repurchase up to an additional billion of common stock during a increase in our annual common stock dividend  to per share 
the acquisition  on february   of an interest in hyundai investment and securities co  ltd 
and its subsidiary hyundai investment trust management co  ltd  which we refer to together as hyundai  a korean asset management firm  subsequently renamed prudential investment securities co  ltd 
on february   am best company upgraded the financial strength ratings of prudential insurance and our domestic insurance operations to a superior from a excellent 
on october   moody s investors service  inc upgraded the financial strength rating of prudential insurance to aa excellent from a good 
on november   standard poor s rating services upgraded the financial strength ratings of prudential insurance and our domestic insurance operations to aa very strong from a strong 
these ratings are of concern to policyholders  agents and intermediaries 
they are not directed toward stockholders and do not in any way reflect evaluations of the safety and security of the common stock 
we analyze performance of the segments and corporate and other operations of the financial services businesses using a measure called adjusted operating income 
see consolidated results of operations for a definition of adjusted operating income and a discussion of its use as a measure of segment operating performance 

table of contents shown below are the contributions of each segment to our adjusted operating income for the years ended december   and and a reconciliation of adjusted operating income of our segments to income from continuing operations before income taxes  extraordinary gain on acquisition and cumulative effect of accounting change

significantly improved results of our individual life and annuities segment reflecting a million improvement from in our individual life business and a million improvement from in our annuities business 
results of the annuity business we acquired from american skandia contributed million of pre tax adjusted operating income in and million in  which represented the initial eight months of results from that business following the may acquisition 
pre tax adjusted operating income from our original individual annuity business  excluding american skandia  increased million from  as the business benefited from higher asset based fees and increased net interest spread on general account annuities 
improved results of our retirement segment reflecting million in pre tax adjusted operating income in from the retirement business acquired from cigna on april  pre tax adjusted operating income from our original retirement business of million in  reflected improved results from our defined contribution business  partially offset by a decline in adjusted operating income from our guaranteed products business 
improved results of our asset management segment  which benefited from increased asset based fees  primarily as a result of increases in assets under management due to the acquisition of cigna s retirement business  market appreciation and positive net inflows 
continued strong results from our group insurance segment  which contributed pre tax adjusted operating income of million in improved results from our international investments segment  which benefited from our february acquisition of an stake in hyundai investment and securities co  ltd  a korean asset management firm

the segment s losses also included costs of million for related to obligations we retained in connection with the businesses we contributed to the joint venture  primarily retained litigation and regulatory matters 
realized investment gains losses  net  and related charges and adjustments for the financial services businesses in included impairments and credit related losses of million  down from million in results of the closed block business for included realized investment gains of million in  compared to million in accounting policies pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements 
if management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances  results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly 
the following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
valuation of investments as prescribed by gaap  we present our investments classified as available for sale  including fixed maturity and equity securities  and our investments classified as trading  such as our trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  at fair value in the statements of financial position 
the fair values for our public fixed maturity securities and our public equity securities are based on quoted market prices or estimates from independent pricing services 
however  for our investments in private securities such as private placement fixed maturity securities  which comprise of our investments as of december   this information is not available 
for these private fixed maturities  fair value is determined typically by using a discounted cash flow model  which considers current market credit spreads for publicly traded issues with similar terms by companies of comparable credit quality  and an additional spread component for the reduced liquidity associated with private placements 
this additional spread component is determined based on surveys of various third party financial institutions 
see realized investment gains and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities private fixed maturities credit quality for information regarding the credit quality of the private fixed maturity securities included in our general account 
for our investments classified as available for sale  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net  a separate component of equity 
for our investments classified as trading  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within commissions and other income 
in addition  investments classified as available for sale  as well as those classified as held to maturity  are subject to impairment reviews to identify when a decline in value is other than temporary 
factors we consider in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary include the extent generally if greater than and duration generally if greater than six months of the decline  the reasons for the decline in value credit event or interest rate related  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time that will allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
when it is determined that a decline in value is other than temporary  the carrying value of the security is reduced to its fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings 
this corresponding charge is referred to as an impairment and is reflected in realized investment gains losses  net in the statements of operations 
the level of impairment losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when 
table of contents economic conditions improve 
see realized investment gains and general account investments realized investment gains for a discussion of the effects of impairments on our operating results for the years ended december   and commercial loans  which comprise of our investments as of december   are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances  net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses 
this allowance includes a loan specific portion as well as a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses 
the loan specific portion is based on management s judgment as to ultimate collectibility of loan principal 
the portfolio reserve is based on a number of factors  such as historical experience and portfolio diversification 
adjustments to the allowance are reflected in realized investment gains losses  net  in our statements of operations 
similar to impairment losses discussed above  the allowance for losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve 
see realized investment gains and general account investments general account investments commercial loans commercial loan quality for a discussion of the effects of the valuation allowance on our operating results for the years ended december  and see realized investment gains and general account investments general account investments for a discussion of our investment portfolio  including the gross unrealized gains and losses as of december   related to the fixed maturity and equity securities of our general account  our policies and procedures regarding the identification of other than temporary declines in investment value  and the carrying value  credit quality  and allowance for losses related to the commercial loans of our general account 
policyholder liabilities future policy benefit reserves we establish reserves for future policy benefits to or on behalf of policyholders in the same period in which the policy is issued 
these reserves relate primarily to the traditional participating whole life policies of our closed block business and the non participating whole life  term life  group disability insurance and group pension and structured settlement products of our financial services businesses 
the future policy benefit reserves for the traditional participating life insurance products of our closed block business  which as of december   represented of our total future policy benefit reserves  are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by gaap 
in applying this method  we use mortality assumptions to determine our expected future benefits and expected future premiums  and apply an interest rate to determine the present value of both the expected future benefit payments and the expected future premiums 
the mortality assumptions we used were based on data from the standard industry experience studies that were used to determine the cash surrender value of the policies and the interest rates used are the contractually guaranteed interest rates used to calculate the cash surrender value of the policy 
gains or losses in our results of operations for each period resulting from deviations in actual experience compared to the experience assumed in establishing our reserves for this business are included in the determination of our annual dividends to these policyholders 
given our current level of policy dividends  we do not anticipate significant volatility in our results of operations in future periods as a result of these deviations 
the future policy benefit reserves for our international insurance segment and our domestic individual life business  which as of december   represented of our total future policy benefit reserves combined  relate primarily to non participating whole life and term life products and are determined in accordance with gaap as the present value of expected future benefits to or on behalf of policyholders plus the present value of future expenses less the present value of future net premiums 
the expected future benefits and expenses are based on mortality  lapse  maintenance expense  and interest rate assumptions 
reserves for new business are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation 
after our reserves are initially established  we perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation 
if reserves determined based on these assumptions are greater than the existing reserves  the existing reserves are adjusted to the greater amount 
our mortality assumptions are generally based on the company s historical experience or standard industry tables  as applicable  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 
we review 
table of contents our mortality assumptions annually and conduct full actuarial studies every three years 
generally  we do not expect our mortality trends to change significantly in the short term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
the reserves for future policy benefits of our retirement segment  which as of december  represented of our total future policy benefit reserves  relate primarily to our group pension and structured settlement products 
these reserves are generally determined as the present value of expected future benefits and expenses based on mortality  retirement  maintenance expense  and interest rate assumptions 
reserves for new business are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the contract is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation 
after our reserves are initially established  we perform premium deficiency testing by product group using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation 
if reserves determined based on these assumptions are greater than the existing reserves  the existing reserves are adjusted to the greater amount 
our best estimate assumptions are determined by product group 
our mortality and retirement assumptions are based on company experience  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 
unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses our liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses relates primarily to the group long term disability products of our group insurance segment 
this liability represents our estimate of future expenses and disability claim payments as well as estimates of claims that we believe have been incurred  but have not yet been reported as of the balance sheet date 
we do not establish loss liabilities until a loss has occurred 
as prescribed by gaap  our liability is determined as the present value of future claim payments and expenses 
future claims payments are estimated using assumed mortality and claim termination factors and an assumed interest rate 
the mortality and claim termination factors are based on standard industry tables and company experience 
our interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns 
of these assumptions  our claim termination assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of liability 
we regularly review our claim termination assumptions compared to actual terminations and conduct full actuarial studies every two to three years 
these studies review actual claim termination experience over a number of years with more weight placed on the actual experience in the more recent years 
if actual experience results in a materially different assumption  we adjust our liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses accordingly with a charge or credit to current period earnings 
generally  we do not expect our actual claim termination experience to deviate significantly from the experience we assumed in determining our level of liability 
deferred policy acquisition costs we capitalize costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts 
these costs include primarily commissions  costs of policy issuance and underwriting  and variable field office expenses 
we amortize these deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac  over the expected lives of the contracts  based on the level and timing of either gross margins  gross profits  or gross premiums  depending on the type of contract 
as of december   dac in our financial services businesses was billion and dac in our closed block business was billion 
dac associated with the traditional participating products of our closed block business is amortized over the expected lives of those contracts in proportion to gross margins 
gross margins consider premiums  investment returns  benefit claims  costs for policy administration  changes in reserves  and dividends to policyholders 
we evaluate our estimates of future gross margins and adjust the related dac balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of actual gross margins and changes in our expected future gross margins 
since many of the factors that affect gross margins are included in the determination of our dividends to these policyholders  we do not anticipate significant volatility in our results of operations as a result of dac adjustments  given our current level of dividends 
dac associated with the term life policies of our domestic individual life insurance business and the non participating whole life  term life and health policies of our international insurance businesses is amortized in proportion to gross premiums 
we evaluate the recoverability of our dac related to these policies as part of 
table of contents our premium deficiency testing 
if a premium deficiency exists  we reduce dac by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings 
if the deficiency is more than the dac balance  we then increase the reserve for future policy benefits by the excess by means of a charge to current period earnings 
generally  we do not expect significant short term deterioration in experience  and therefore do not expect significant writedowns of the related dac 
dac associated with the variable and universal life policies of our domestic individual life insurance and international insurance businesses and the variable and fixed annuity contracts of our individual annuities business is amortized over the expected life of these policies in proportion to gross profits 
in calculating gross profits  we consider mortality  persistency  and other elements as well as rates of return on investments associated with these contracts 
we regularly evaluate and adjust the related dac balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of our actual gross profits and changes in our assumptions regarding estimated future gross profits 
our evaluation of dac related to variable annuity contracts considers expected gross profits that would be generated within a pre established reasonably possible range  or corridor  of future rate of return scenarios 
adjustments to dac are made only when our long term view of investment returns considered in our estimates of future gross profits results in a dac balance outside of the corridor 
however  notwithstanding our corridor approach  we may determine that a revision of our expected gross profits and a related adjustment to our dac is necessary if changes in additional factors  such as policyholder activity  suggest that our current view of expected gross profits may no longer represent our best estimate 
for variable annuity contracts  dac is more sensitive to the effects of changes in our estimates of gross profits due primarily to the significant portion of gross profits that is dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options  and the shorter average life of the contracts 
this rate of return influences the fees we earn  costs we incur associated with minimum death benefit and other contractual guarantees specific to our variable annuity contracts  as well as other sources of profit 
this is also true  to a lesser degree  for our variable life policies  however  the variable life policies derive a significant portion of their gross profits from margins in the cost of insurance charge 
in evaluating the dac for our domestic variable life insurance and annuity products  future rate of return assumptions are evaluated using a reversion to mean approach  a common industry practice 
under this approach  we consider actual returns over a period of time and project returns for the future period so that the assets grow at the expected rate of return for the entire period 
if the projected future rate of return is greater than our maximum future rate of return  we use our maximum reasonable future rate of return 
for variable annuities products  our expected rate of return is per annum  which reflects an expected rate of return of per annum for equity type assets 
the future equity rate of return used varies by product  but was under per annum for all of our variable annuity products for our evaluation of deferred policy acquisition costs as of december  to demonstrate the sensitivity of our variable annuity dac balance relative to our future rate of return  increasing or decreasing our future rate of return by basis points would have required us to consider adjustments  subject to our application of the corridor approach  to that dac balance as follows 
the information provided in the table below considers only the effect of changes in our future rate of return and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency  mortality  or expenses included in our evaluation of dac

goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december of each year and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
impairment testing requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying 
table of contents amount  including goodwill  and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the determination of a reporting unit s fair value is based on management s best estimate  which generally considers the unit s expected future earnings and market based earning multiples of peer companies 
as of december   we have million of goodwill reflected on our statements of financial position 
during  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million relating to our dryden wealth management business and  during  we recorded goodwill impairments of million relating primarily to our property and casualty business 
there were no goodwill impairment charges during pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specific eligibility requirements 
our net periodic costs for these plans consider an assumed interest rate  an expected rate of return on plan assets and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs 
of these assumptions  our expected rate of return assumptions have historically had the most significant effect on our net period costs associated with these plans 
we determine our expected return on plan assets based upon the arithmetical average of prospective returns  which is based upon a risk free rate as of the measurement date adjusted by a risk premium that considers historical statistics and expected investment manager performance  for equity  debt and real estate markets applied on a weighted average basis to our asset portfolio 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for our actual asset allocations by asset category and the asset allocation ranges prescribed by our investment policy guidelines for both our pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
our assumed long term rate of return for was for our pension plan and for our other post retirement benefit plans 
given the amount of plan assets as of september   the beginning of the measurement year  if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was percentage point lower or percentage point higher than the rates we assumed  the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below 
the information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed long term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the measurement year  without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long term rate of return 
for the year ended december  increase decrease in net periodic pension benefit increase decrease in net periodic other postretirement benefit cost in millions increase in expected rate of return by percentage point decrease in expected rate of return by percentage point for a discussion of our expected rate of return on plan assets for see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment corporate and other operations 
in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions  our net periodic pension benefit and our net periodic cost for other postretirement benefits may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions  special benefits to terminated employees  or changes in benefits provided under the plans 
taxes on income our effective tax rate is based on expected income and statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans  planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times from the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than the actual rate applied on the tax return 
some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences are temporary  reversing over time  such as valuation of insurance reserves 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or expenditures for which we have already taken a 
table of contents deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized in our financial statements 
the application of gaap requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carry forward periods 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  will be realized 
our accounting represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 
certain changes or future events  such as changes in tax legislation  geographic mix of earnings and completion of tax audits could have an impact on our estimates and effective tax rate 
to the extent our effective tax rate increases or decreases by percent of income from continuing operations before income taxes  extraordinary gain on acquisition and cumulative effect of accounting change  consolidated income from continuing operations before extraordinary gain on acquisition and cumulative effect of accounting change would have increased or declined by million in the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions 
we reserve for our best estimate of potential payments settlements to be made to the internal revenue service and other taxing jurisdictions for audits ongoing or not yet commenced 
we anticipate that the internal revenue service will complete its examination of through during the first half of although the results of these audits are not final  based on currently available information  we believe that the outcome will not have an adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
reserves for contingencies a contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events 
under gaap  reserves for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated 
an example is the establishment of a reserve for losses in connection with an unresolved legal matter 
the initial reserve reflects management s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately  when the matter is brought to closure

 accounting to stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  an allowable alternative method under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no  accounting for stock based compensation 
under apb no 
 we did not recognize any stock based compensation expense for employee stock options as all employee stock options had an exercise price equal to the market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
effective january   we changed our accounting for employee stock options to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 as amended  prospectively for all new awards granted to employees on or after january  under these provisions  the fair value of all employee stock options awarded on or after january   is included in the determination of net income  but not for options awarded prior thereto 
accordingly  the amount we include in the determination of net income is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards since inception of the employee stock option plan 
the fair value of employee stock options issued prior to january  was estimated using a black scholes option pricing model 
for options issued on or after january   the fair value of each option was estimated using a binomial option pricing model 
both option pricing models consider the following assumptions in estimating fair value dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected life of the option 
if we had recognized stock option expense for all employee stock options under the fair value based accounting method  net income of the financial services businesses for the year ended december   would have been reduced by million or  per share of common stock on a both basic and diluted basis 
the net income of the closed block business for the year ended december   would have been reduced by million with no change in earnings per share of the class b stock

table of contents in managing our business  we analyze operating performance separately for our financial services businesses and our closed block business 
for the financial services businesses  we analyze our segments operating performance using adjusted operating income 
results of the closed block business for all periods are evaluated and presented only in accordance with gaap 
adjusted operating income does not equate to income from continuing operations before income taxes  extraordinary gain on acquisition and cumulative effect of accounting change as determined in accordance with gaap but is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources  and consistent with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  is our measure of segment performance 
adjusted operating income is calculated for the segments of the financial services businesses by adjusting each segment s income from continuing operations before income taxes  extraordinary gain on acquisition and cumulative effect of accounting change to exclude the following items realized investment gains net of losses  except as indicated below  and related charges and adjustments  net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes  life insurance sales practices remedies and costs  and the contribution to income loss of divested businesses that have been or will be sold or exited that do not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment under gaap 
we include in adjusted operating income the portion of our realized investment gains and losses on derivatives that arises from the termination of contracts used to hedge our foreign currency earnings in the same period that the expected earnings emerge 
similarly  we include in adjusted operating income the portion of our realized gains and losses on derivatives used to manage interest rate and currency exposure on asset and liability mismatches that represents current period yield adjustments for these assets and liabilities 
the contributions to income loss of wind down businesses that we have not divested remain in adjusted operating income 
the excluded items are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations 
adjusted operating income is not a substitute for net income determined in accordance with gaap  and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies 
however  we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of the financial services businesses 
adjusted operating income excludes net realized investment gains and losses  other than those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments 
a significant element of realized investment losses is impairments and losses from sales of credit impaired securities  the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles and can vary considerably across periods 
the timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities 
trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions 
similarly  adjusted operating income excludes investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes  because these recorded changes in asset and liability values will ultimately inure to the contractholders 
adjusted operating income also excludes life insurance sales practices remedies and costs relating to the settlement of individual life insurance sales practices issues for the period from through because they relate to a substantial and identifiable non recurring event 
adjusted operating income excludes the results of divested businesses because they are not relevant to understanding our ongoing operating results

international insurance and investments division international insurance our international insurance operations are subject to currency fluctuations that can materially affect their us dollar results from period to period even if results on a local currency basis are relatively constant 
exchange rates fluctuated significantly for the years ended december   and the financial results of our international insurance segment reflect the impact of a currency hedging program designed to mitigate the risk that unfavorable exchange rate changes will reduce the segment s us dollar equivalent earnings 
this program is primarily associated with our japanese and korean insurance businesses 
under the program  local earnings are translated into us dollar equivalent earnings at fixed rates based upon forward currency contracts executed with third parties reflected in corporate and other operations 
results of corporate and other operations include any differences between gains or losses from the contracts with third parties and the translation adjustments recorded by the international insurance segment 
these hedging transactions decreased revenues and adjusted operating income of the international insurance segment by million and million in and  respectively  and increased adjusted operating income by million in unless otherwise stated  we have translated all information in this section  including the impact of the currency hedging program  on the basis of actual exchange rates for the periods indicated

sales results in managing our international insurance business  we analyze new annualized premiums  which do not correspond to revenues under gaap  as well as revenues  because new annualized premiums measure the current sales performance of the segment  while revenues reflect the renewal persistency and aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income  in addition to current sales 
new annualized premiums on an actual and constant exchange rate basis are as follows for the periods indicated

there was no similar benefit to an increase in the life planner count also contributed to the growth in sales 
sales in all other countries  also on a constant exchange rate basis  were unchanged  primarily as a result of the benefit to sales in in our operation in korea  from sales activity in anticipation of a premium rate increase in april investment margins and other profitability factors many of our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at mandated guaranteed interest rates 
japanese authorities regulate interest rates guaranteed in our japanese insurance contracts 
the regulated guaranteed interest rates do not necessarily match the actual returns on the underlying investments 
the spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is an element of the profit or loss that we will experience on these products 
with regulatory approval  guaranteed rates may be changed on new business 
while these actions enhance our ability 
table of contents to set rates commensurate with available investment returns  the major sources of profitability on our products sold in japan  other than at gibraltar  are margins on mortality  morbidity and expense charges rather than investment spreads 
we base premiums and cash values in most countries in which we operate on mandated mortality and morbidity tables

table of contents to million in the costs in include the impact of a reduction in our policy dividend scale 
our obligations under these settlements relate to both variable life and traditional dividend paying policies that were issued before our demutualization 
a reduction in the dividend scale determined by the board of directors of prudential insurance in late resulted in an increase in the obligation for net premiums on traditional dividend paying policies to be absorbed by us under these settlements  which was recognized within corporate and other results 
for purposes of calculating pension income from our own qualified pension plan for the year ended december   we will continue to apply a discount rate of and we will reduce the expected return on plan assets to from in in addition  the rate of increase in compensation levels will remain unchanged at in we determined our expected return on plan assets based upon the arithmetic average of prospective returns  which is based upon a risk free rate as of the measurement date adjusted by a risk premium that considers historical statistics and expected investment manager performance  for equity  debt and real estate markets applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio 
giving effect to the foregoing assumptions  we expect that on a consolidated basis income from our own qualified pension plan will continue to contribute to adjusted operating income in  but at a level of about million to million below the contribution of million 
in  pension service costs related to active employees will continue to be allocated to our business segments 
the allocated expenses to our business segments will be partially offset by a reduction in the allocation of other benefit costs related to non active employees that will be retained in corporate level activities

as required by gaap  we developed an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in the closed block  and if actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expect  we will record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation 
we will subsequently pay this excess to closed block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future closed block performance that is less favorable than we originally expected 
the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the closed block business will include any policyholder dividend obligations that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expect in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the board of directors of prudential insurance 
if cumulative performance is less favorable than we expected  the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the closed block business will be the actual dividends declared by the board of directors 
subsequent to the date of demutualization  there was no required charge to expense to recognize a policyholder dividend obligation for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expect 
however  net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the closed block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation to be paid to closed block policyholders  unless otherwise offset by future experience  with an offsetting amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
accordingly  we have recorded a policyholder dividend obligation to closed block policyholders of billion as of december  operating results management does not consider adjusted operating income to assess operating performance of the closed block business

table of contents we perform impairment reviews on an ongoing basis to determine when a decline in value is other than temporary 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the extent generally if greater than and duration generally if greater than six months of the decline in value  the reasons for the decline credit event or interest rate related  our ability and intent to hold our investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer 
when we determine that there is an other than temporary impairment we write down the value of the security to its fair value  with a corresponding charge recorded in realized investment gains losses  net 
the causes of the impairments discussed below were specific to each individual issuer and did not directly result in impairments to other securities within the same industry or geographic region

for a further discussion of our policies regarding other than temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording equity impairments  see general account investments equity securities impairments of equity securities below 
additionally  see accounting policies pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates valuation of investments above for a discussion on investment valuations 
the level of impairments generally reflects economic conditions and is expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve 
we may realize additional credit related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives 
we require most issuers of private fixed maturity securities to pay us make whole yield maintenance payments when they prepay the securities 
prepayments are driven by factors specific to the activities of our borrowers as well as the interest rate environment 
we use derivative contracts to hedge the risk that changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates will affect the market value of certain investments 
we also use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will reduce us dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non us businesses 
derivative contracts also include forward purchases and sales of to be announced mortgage backed securities primarily related to our mortgage dollar roll program 
many of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  and consequently we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings  although we do not necessarily account for the hedged assets or liabilities the same way 
accordingly  realized investment gains and losses from our hedging activities can contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income 
the comparisons below describe realized investment gains  net of losses and related charges and adjustments 
related charges  which are not applicable to the closed block business  pertain to policyholder dividends  deferred policy acquisition costs  reserves for future policy benefits  and payments associated with the market value adjustment features related to certain of the annuity products we sell 
a percentage of net realized investment gains on specified gibraltar life assets is required to be paid as dividends to gibraltar life policyholders 
we amortize deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products based on estimated gross profits  which include net realized investment gains on the underlying invested assets 
the related charge for deferred policy acquisition costs represents the amortization related to net realized investment gains 
we adjust the reserves for some of our policies when cash flows related to these policies are affected by net realized investment gains  and the related charge for reserves for future policy benefits represents that adjustment 
certain of our annuity products contain a market value adjustment feature that requires us to pay to the contractholder or entitles us to receive from the contractholder  upon surrender  a market value adjustment based on the crediting rates on the contract surrendered compared to crediting rates on newly issued contracts or based on an index rate at the time of purchase compared to an index rate at time of surrender  as applicable 
these payments offset the realized investment gains or losses incurred upon the disposition of the underlying invested assets 
the related charge represents the payments or receipts associated with these market value adjustment features 
the changes in these related charges from one period to another may be disproportionate to the changes in realized investment gains  net of losses  because the indicated adjustments relate to realized investment gains evaluated over several periods 
a portion of realized gains  pertaining to certain derivative results  is included in adjusted operating income 
pursuant to a currency hedging program  we execute forward sale contracts in the hedged currencies in exchange 
table of contents for us dollars at a specified exchange rate 
the maturities of these contracts correspond with future periods in which non us earnings are expected to be generated 
these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under gaap 
all resulting profits or losses from such contracts  including mark to market adjustments of open contracts  are included in realized investment gains losses  net 
when the contracts are terminated in the same period that the expected earnings emerge  the resulting positive or negative cash flow is included in adjusted operating income 
in addition  we utilize interest and currency swaps and other derivatives to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities  including duration mismatches 
for the derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  mark to market adjustments of open contracts as well as periodic swap settlements are included in realized investment gains losses  net 
however  the periodic swap settlements as well as other derivative related yield adjustments are included in adjusted operating income to reflect the after hedge yield of the underlying instruments 
as part of the acquisition of cigna s retirement business  we entered into reinsurance agreements with cigna  including a modified coinsurance with assumption arrangement that applies to the defined benefit guaranteed cost contracts acquired 
the net results of these contracts are recorded in commissions and other income  as a result of the reinsurance arrangement  and such net results include realized investment gains and losses 
adjustments to realized investment gains losses  net include the adjustment necessary to exclude these realized investment gains and losses from adjusted operating income

general account investments we maintain a diversified investment portfolio in our insurance companies to support our liabilities to customers in our financial services businesses and the closed block business  as well as our other general liabilities 
our general account does not include assets of our securities brokerage  securities trading  and banking operations  assets of our asset management operations  including assets managed for third parties  and assets classified as separate account assets on our balance sheet 
the general account portfolio is managed pursuant to the distinct objectives of the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
the primary investment objectives of the financial services businesses include matching the liability characteristics of the major products and other obligations of the company  and maximizing the portfolio book yield within risk constraints 
the primary investment objectives of the closed block business include providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the closed block business and the class b shareholders  and maximizing total return and preserving principal  within risk constraints  while matching the liability characteristics of the major products in the closed block business 
management of investments we design asset mix strategies for our general account to match the characteristics of our products and other obligations and seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities 
we achieve income objectives through asset liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocations within a disciplined risk management framework 
our asset allocation also reflects our desire for broad diversification across asset classes  sectors and issuers 
the investment committee of our board of directors oversees our proprietary investments 
it also reviews performance and risk positions quarterly 
our senior vice president  asset liability and risk management  approves the investment policy for the general account assets of our insurance subsidiaries and oversees the investment process for our general account 
under his direction  the asset liability and risk management group works with our business units to develop investment objectives  performance factors and measures and asset allocation ranges 
the asset liability and risk management group also works closely with each of our business units to ensure that the specific characteristics of our products are incorporated into its processes 
the asset liability and risk management group has the authority to initiate tactical shifts within exposure ranges approved annually by the investment committee 
the asset management segment manages virtually all of our investments  other than those of our international insurance segment  under the direction of the asset liability and risk management group 
our international insurance segment manages the majority of its investments locally 
asset liability management the asset liability and risk management group uses a disciplined  risk controlled approach to asset liability management 
the methodology focuses on aligning assets to the effective sensitivity of the cash flow and return requirements of our liabilities 
the asset liability and risk management group consults with the product experts in the businesses on an ongoing basis to arrive at asset liability matching policies and decisions 
we adjust this dynamic process as products change  as we develop new products and as changes in the market environment occur 

table of contents we develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and attributed or accumulated surplus  each with distinct risk characteristics 
most of our products can be categorized into the following three classes interest crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual investment experience  such as fixed annuities  participating individual and experience rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual dividends  interest or return of premium  and guaranteed products for which there are price or rate guarantees for the life of the contract  such as gics 
we determine a target asset mix for each product class  which we reflect in our investment policies 
our asset liability management process has permitted us to manage interest sensitive products successfully through several market cycles 
portfolio composition our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities  commercial loans  equity securities and other invested assets 
the composition of our general account reflects  within the discipline provided by our risk management approach  our need for competitive results and the selection of diverse investment alternatives available primarily through our asset management segment 
the size of our portfolio enables us to invest in asset classes that may be unavailable to the typical investor 
our total general account investments were billion and billion as of december  and december   respectively  which are segregated between the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
total general account investments attributable to the financial services businesses were billion and billion as of december  and december   respectively  while total general account investments attributable to the closed block business were billion and billion as of december  and december   respectively

the increase in general account investments attributable to the financial services businesses and resulting change in portfolio composition in was due primarily to approximately billion of investments added during as part of the acquisition of the retirement business of cigna corporation 
the majority of the investments added from this acquisition are reflected in trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and commercial loans 
the acquisition of aoba life on november  also added approximately billion of investments  primarily reflected in fixed maturities  available for sale 
upon the adoption of sop on january   billion in separate account assets were reclassified  primarily resulting in a billion increase in fixed maturities  available for sale and a billion increase in trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities

the increase in general account investments attributable to the closed block business in was primarily due to portfolio growth as a result of the reinvestment of net investment income  partially offset by net operating outflows

the overall income yield on our general account investments after investment expenses  excluding realized investment gains losses  was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net investment income yield attributable to the financial services businesses was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in yield between periods was primarily due to declines in fixed maturities and commercial loan yields primarily attributable to the impact of investment activities in a low interest rate environment and the inclusion of investments related to cigna s retirement business at yields below the average portfolio yields 
the yields on the investments related to cigna s retirement business reflect the adjustment to fair value at the purchase date 
the yield on the financial services businesses portfolios includes the income yield on the investment portfolio of our japanese insurance operations  which was for the year ended december   compared to 
table of contents for the year ended december  the increase in yield on the japanese insurance portfolio between periods is primarily attributable to an increase in us dollar investments and more favorable foreign exchange rates 
the net investment income yield attributable to the closed block business was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase in yield for the year ended december  is primarily due to more favorable results from limited partnerships within other investments 
continuation of the current low interest rate environment will result in our reinvestment of maturing securities at lower rates and would reduce the yield we are able to earn on our investments  which support our obligations for certain products  including traditional whole life insurance  fixed annuities and guaranteed investment contracts 
this reduction in yield would also have a corresponding impact on the spread  which is the difference between the yield on our investments and the amounts that we are required to pay our customers related to these products  which could have a negative impact on our future profitability 
fixed maturity securities investment mix our fixed maturity securities portfolio consists of publicly traded and privately placed debt securities across an array of industry categories 
our international insurance portfolios are predominantly comprised of foreign government securities 
we manage our public portfolio to a risk profile directed by the asset liability and risk management group and  in the case of our international insurance portfolios  to a profile that reflects local market regulations and our investment competencies in these markets 
we seek to employ relative value analysis both in credit selection and in purchasing and selling securities 
the total return that we earn on the portfolio will be reflected both as investment income and also as realized gains or losses on investments 
we use our private placement and asset backed portfolios to enhance the diversification and yield of our overall fixed maturity portfolio 
within our domestic portfolios  we maintain a private fixed income portfolio that is larger than the industry average as a percentage of total fixed income holdings 
over the last several years  our investment staff has directly originated more than half of our annual private placement originations 
our origination capability offers the opportunity to lead transactions and gives us the opportunity for better terms  including covenants and call protection  and to take advantage of innovative deal structures

impairments of fixed maturity securities we maintain separate monitoring processes for public and private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that require special scrutiny and management 
our public fixed maturity asset managers formally review all public fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or industry specific concerns 
we classify public fixed maturity securities of issuers that have defaulted as securities not in good standing and all other public watch list assets as closely monitored 
for private placements our credit and portfolio management processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management 
we have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish checks and balances for new investments 
we apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due diligence for all transactions  whether they originate through our own in house origination staff or through agents 
our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions 
we set all valuation standards centrally  and we assess the fair value of all investments quarterly 
our private fixed maturity asset managers conduct specific servicing tests on each investment on an ongoing basis to determine whether the investment is in compliance or should be placed on the watch list or assigned an early warning classification 
we assign early warning classifications to those issuers that have failed a servicing test or experienced a minor covenant default  and we continue to monitor them for improvement or deterioration 
in certain situations  the general account benefits from negotiated rate increases or fees resulting from a covenant breach 
we assign closely monitored status to those investments that have been recently restructured or for which restructuring is a possibility due to substantial credit deterioration or material covenant defaults 
we classify as not in good standing securities of issuers that are in more severe conditions  for example  bankruptcy or payment default 
fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity are those securities where we have the intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity 
these securities are reflected at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of financial position 
other fixed maturity securities are considered available for sale  and  as a result  we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent that amortized cost is different from estimated fair value 
all held to maturity securities and all available for sale securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other than temporary impairments in value 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the extent generally if greater than and the duration generally if greater than six months of the decline  the reasons for the decline in value credit event or interest rate related  our ability and intent to hold our investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer 
when we determine that there is an other than temporary impairment  we record a writedown to estimated fair value  which reduces the cost basis 
the new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value 
estimated fair values for fixed maturities  other than private placement securities  are based on quoted market prices or prices obtained from independent pricing services 
estimated fair values for private placement fixed maturities are determined primarily by using a discounted cash flow model which considers the current market spreads between the us treasury yield curve and corporate bond yield curve  adjusted for type of issue  its current credit quality and its remaining average life 
the estimated fair value of certain non performing private placement fixed maturities is based on management s estimates

sources of capital prudential financial is a holding company with insubstantial assets other than investments in subsidiaries 
its capitalization and use of financial leverage are consistent with its ratings targets 
its subsidiaries and 
table of contents businesses are also capitalized in accordance with their ratings targets 
our financial strength rating targets for our domestic life insurance companies are aa aa aa for standard poor s rating services  or s p  moody s investors service  inc  or moody s  and fitch ratings ltd  or fitch  respectively  and a for am best company  or am best 
for prudential financial  our long term senior debt rating objectives are a for s p  moody s and fitch and a for am best 
for our current ratings information  see business ratings 
the primary components of capitalization for the financial services businesses consist of the equity we attribute to the financial services businesses excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments and outstanding borrowings of the financial services businesses that are ascribed to general corporate purposes as discussed below under financing activities 
based on these components  the capital position of the financial services businesses as of december   was as follows in millions attributed equity excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments debt used for general corporate purposes total capital as shown in the table above  as of december   the financial services businesses had approximately billion in capital  all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its three divisions and its corporate and other operations 
based on our assessments of these businesses and operations  we believe that the capital of the financial services businesses exceeds the amount required to support its current business risks 
we believe that this excess capital  combined with unused borrowing capacity as discussed below  exceeds billion 
although some of these resources are in our regulated subsidiaries  and their availability is subject to prior regulatory notice  approval or non disapproval  we believe these resources give us substantial financial flexibility 
the risk based capital  or rbc  ratio is the primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of prudential insurance  which encompasses businesses of both the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
we manage prudential insurance s rbc ratio to a level consistent with our ratings targets 
rbc is determined by statutory formulas that consider risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets  insurance related risks associated with prudential insurance s products  interest rate risks and general business risks 
the rbc ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of prudential insurance s statutory capitalization 
we are continuing the process of arranging reinsurance of the closed block 
as of december   we have reinsured of the closed block 
entering into these arrangements allows the rbc formula treatment of the closed block to reflect more closely its economic risk profile 
the closed block continues to be adequately capitalized to meet its future obligations as discussed under overview closed block business 
on april   prudential insurance purchased cigna s retirement business  which was subsequently renamed prudential retirement insurance and annuity company  or priac  for billion 
given the effects of the acquisition of priac  the prudential insurance distribution to prudential holdings  llc see uses of capital restrictions on dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries  closed block reinsurance  and the results of its operations  prudential insurance continues to meet or exceed its rbc target level 
we also consider borrowing capacity in evaluating the capital position and financial flexibility of the financial services businesses 
we believe that a ratio of debt used for general corporate purposes to total capital equal to or less is consistent with our ratings objectives for prudential financial 
our ratio as of december  of implies that the financial services businesses could incur up to billion in additional borrowing for general corporate purposes and remain consistent with our ratings objectives 
uses of capital cigna retirement acquisition 
as noted above  we used billion of capital within prudential insurance to fund the purchase price for the acquisition of cigna s retirement business  which closed on april  
table of contents share repurchases 
for the year ended december   the company acquired million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately billion 
on november   prudential financial s board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which prudential financial is authorized to purchase up to billion of its outstanding common stock in the timing and amount of any repurchases under the authorization will be determined by management based on market conditions and other considerations  and such repurchases may be effected in the open market or through negotiated transactions 
this stock repurchase program supersedes all previous repurchase programs 
demutualization consideration 
in the year ended december   prudential financial paid out million in demutualization consideration to eligible policyholders whom we have located since the time of demutualization and to governmental authorities in respect of other eligible policyholders we continue to be unable to locate 
we remain obligated to disburse million of demutualization consideration to state agencies if we are unable to establish contact with eligible policyholders within time periods prescribed by state unclaimed property laws 
these laws historically required remittance after periods ranging from three to seven years  but many states have enacted laws that reduce these holding periods to accelerate the reporting of unclaimed demutualization property 
liabilities relating to demutualization consideration payments were established at the time of demutualization in restrictions on dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries our insurance and various other companies are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and on other transfers of funds to affiliates 
with respect to prudential insurance  new jersey insurance law provides that  except in the case of extraordinary dividends or distributions  all dividends or distributions paid by prudential insurance may be declared or paid only from unassigned surplus  as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles  less unrealized investment gains and revaluation of assets 
as of december  and  prudential insurance s unassigned surplus was billion and billion  respectively 
there were applicable adjustments for unrealized investment gains of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
prudential insurance also must notify the new jersey insurance regulator of its intent to pay a dividend 
if the dividend  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  would exceed a specified statutory limit  prudential insurance must also obtain a non disapproval from the new jersey insurance regulator 
the current statutory limitation applicable to new jersey life insurers generally is the greater of of the prior calendar year s statutory surplus billion as of december  or the prior calendar year s statutory net gain from operations excluding realized investment gains and losses billion for the year ended december  
in addition to these regulatory limitations  the terms of the ihc debt contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by prudential insurance applicable to the financial services businesses in the event the closed block business is in financial distress and under other circumstances 
in  prudential insurance made a distribution of million to prudential holdings  llc 
prudential holdings  llc in turn paid million of such distribution to prudential financial 
the remainder of the distribution is held as collateral at prudential holdings  llc for the benefit of the ihc debt holders 
the laws regulating dividends of the other states and foreign jurisdictions where our other insurance companies are domiciled are similar  but not identical  to new jersey s 
pursuant to gibraltar life s reorganization  in addition to regulatory restrictions  there are certain restrictions on gibraltar life s ability to pay dividends to prudential financial 
there are also regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by prudential life insurance company  ltd 
or prudential of japan 
we anticipate that it will be several years before these restrictions will allow gibraltar life and prudential of japan to pay dividends 
the ability of our asset management subsidiaries  and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries  to pay dividends is unrestricted 
liquidity of subsidiaries domestic insurance subsidiaries general liquidity liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations 
we manage the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources 
table of contents of cash flows to meet all of our obligations 
liquidity is provided by a variety of sources  as described more fully below  including portfolios of liquid assets 
the investment portfolios of our domestic and foreign insurance operations are integral to the overall liquidity of those operations 
we segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset liability management approach specific to the requirements of our product lines 
this enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity  as well as the interest and credit risk profiles  of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities 
a projection process for cash flows from operations serves to ensure there is sufficient liquidity to meet projected cash outflows  including claims 
liquidity is measured against internally developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of the asset portfolio 
the results are affected substantially by the overall quality of our investments 
cash flow the principal sources of liquidity of prudential insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries are premiums and annuity considerations  investment and fee income and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance  annuities and guaranteed products operations 
principal uses of liquidity relate to benefits  claims  dividends paid to policyholders  and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders  withdrawals and net policy loan activity 
uses of liquidity also include commissions  general and administrative expenses  purchases of investments  and payments in connection with financing activities 
we believe that cash flows from our insurance  annuity and guaranteed products operations are adequate to satisfy the liquidity requirements of these operations based on our current liability structure and considering a variety of reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
the continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors such as future securities market conditions  changes in interest rate levels and policyholder perceptions of our financial strength  which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows 
the domestic insurance operations cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal  proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income  net of amounts reinvested 
the primary liquidity risks with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors  our counterparties willingness to extend repurchase and or securities lending arrangements  and market volatility 
we closely manage these risks through our credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our liquidity position 
in managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations  we also consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations 
we use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent  timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers from annuity contracts and deposit liabilities 
the following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities based on statutory liability values as of the dates indicated 
december  december  amount of total amount of total in millions not subject to discretionary withdrawal provisions subject to discretionary withdrawal  with adjustment with market value adjustment at market value at contract value  less surrender charge of or more subtotal subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value with no surrender charge or surrender charge of less than total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities 
table of contents gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations products amounted to billion  including billion associated with the businesses of priac  and billion for and  respectively 
these withdrawals include contractually scheduled maturities of general account guaranteed investment contracts of  million and  million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
since these contractual withdrawals  as well as the level of surrenders experienced  were consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management  the associated cash outflows did not have an adverse impact on our overall liquidity 
individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than our annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
annuity benefits under group annuity contracts are generally not subject to early withdrawal 
total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities as of december   shown in the table above  include billion related to the businesses of priac 
approximately of the reserves and deposit liabilities of priac are subject to discretionary withdrawal with a market value adjustment 
liquid assets liquid assets include cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  fixed maturities and public equity securities 
as of december  and december   our domestic insurance operations had billion  including billion related to priac  and billion in liquid assets  respectively 
as of december   billion  or  of the fixed maturity investments held in our domestic insurance company general account portfolios were rated investment grade 
the remaining billion  or  of fixed maturity investments were rated non investment grade 
we consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets for example  type of asset and credit quality in calculating internal liquidity benchmark results in order to evaluate the adequacy of our domestic insurance operations liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios 
we believe that the liquidity profile of our assets is sufficient to satisfy liquidity requirements under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
given the size and liquidity profile of our investment portfolios  we believe that claim experience varying from our projections is not a significant liquidity risk 
our asset liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected payment of loss reserves as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities 
historically  there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of our investments and the payment of loss reserves 
for a further discussion of asset liability management  see realized investment gains and general account investments general account investments asset liability management 
our domestic insurance companies liquidity is managed through access to substantial investment portfolios as well as a variety of instruments available for funding and or managing short term cash flow mismatches  including from time to time those arising from claim levels in excess of projections 
to the extent we need to pay claims in excess of projections  we may borrow temporarily or sell investments sooner than anticipated to pay these claims  which may result in realized capital gains or losses or increased borrowing costs affecting results of operations 
for a further discussion of realized gains or losses  see realized investment gains and general account investments realized investment gains 
we believe that borrowing temporarily or selling investments earlier than anticipated will not have a material impact on the liquidity of our domestic insurance companies 
payment of claims and sale of investments earlier than anticipated would have an impact on the reported level of cash flow from operating and investing activities  respectively  in our financial statements 
prudential funding  llc prudential funding  llc  or prudential funding  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential insurance  continues to serve as a source of financing for prudential insurance and its subsidiaries  as well as for other subsidiaries of prudential financial 
prudential funding operates under a support agreement with prudential insurance whereby prudential insurance has agreed to maintain prudential funding s positive tangible net worth 
table of contents at all times 
prudential funding borrows funds primarily through the direct issuance of commercial paper 
prudential funding s outstanding loans to other subsidiaries of prudential financial have declined over time as it transitions into a financing company primarily for prudential insurance and its remaining subsidiaries 
while other subsidiaries continue to borrow from prudential funding  they also borrow from prudential financial and directly from third parties 
the impact of prudential funding on liquidity is considered in the internal liquidity benchmarks of the domestic insurance operations 
as of december   prudential financial  prudential insurance and prudential funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling billion 
currently  prudential insurance and prudential funding have access to billion of these lines and there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of december  or december  for a further discussion on lines of credit  see financing activity lines of credit and other credit facilities 
international insurance subsidiaries in our international insurance operations  liquidity is provided through ongoing operations as well as portfolios of liquid assets 
in managing the liquidity and the interest and credit risk profiles of our international insurance portfolios  we employ a discipline similar to the discipline employed for domestic insurance subsidiaries 
liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity benchmarks taking into account the liquidity of the asset portfolios 
similar to our domestic operations  in managing the liquidity of these operations we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations 
as of december  and december   our international insurance subsidiaries had total general account insurance related liabilities other than dividends payable to policyholders of billion and billion  respectively 
of those amounts  billion and billion  respectively  are associated with gibraltar life  our largest international insurance subsidiary 
concurrent with our acquisition of gibraltar life in april  substantially all of its insurance liabilities were restructured  under a reorganization  to include special surrender penalties on existing policies 
these charges mitigate the extent  timing  and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers and apply to billion and billion of gibraltar life s insurance related reserves as of december   and december   respectively 
the following table sets forth the schedule for each fiscal year ending march of special surrender charges on policies that were in force at the time of the acquisition policies issued by gibraltar life post acquisition are not subject to the above restructured policy surrender charge schedule 
policies issued post acquisition are subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value  less applicable surrender charges  which are currently or more 
in the years and  a special dividend to certain gibraltar life policyholders will be payable based on of net realized investment gains  if any  over the value of real estate and loans  net of transaction costs and taxes  included in the reorganization plan 
as of december   a liability of million is included in policyholders dividends to cover the special dividend 
the special dividend will take the form of either additional policy values or cash 
we expect that the installment will be approximately million  based upon realized investment gains as of december   and will be mostly in the form of additional policy values 
gibraltar s investment portfolio is structured to provide adequate liquidity for the special dividend 
prudential of japan  with billion and billion of general account insurance related liabilities other than dividends to policyholders as of december   and december   respectively  is our second largest international insurance subsidiary 
prudential of japan did not have a material amount of general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities subject to discretionary withdrawal as of december  or december  additionally  we believe that the individual life insurance policies sold by prudential of japan do not 
table of contents have significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
in november  prudential of japan purchased aoba life insurance company  ltd  or aoba life 
aoba life is a japanese life insurer with a run off book of insurance contracts and is the successor entity to the former nissan mutual life insurance company  which was restructured in june aoba life was merged into prudential of japan in february aoba life had billion of general account insurance related liabilities other than dividends to policyholders as of december  aoba life did not have a material amount of general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities subject to discretionary withdrawal as of december  additionally  we believe that the individual life insurance policies sold by aoba life do not have significant withdrawal risk because of the time elapsed since the restructuring and policyholders must undergo a new underwriting process to obtain a new insurance policy 
as of december  and december   our international insurance subsidiaries had cash and short term investments of approximately billion  including billion from aoba life  and billion  respectively  and fixed maturity investments with fair values of billion  including billion from aoba life  and billion  respectively

the facility expiring in may includes financial institutions  many of which are also among the financial institutions participating in the october facility 
we use these facilities primarily as back up liquidity lines for our commercial paper programs  and there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of december  or december  effective june  we formally allocated the billion of the may facility to prudential financial 
our ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on our continued satisfaction of customary conditions  including maintenance at all times by prudential insurance of total adjusted capital of at least billion based on statutory accounting principles prescribed under new jersey law 
prudential insurance s total adjusted capital as of december   was approximately billion and continues to be above the billion threshold

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our major contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt operating leases other long term liabilities insurance liabilities undistributed demutualization consideration total see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
insurance liabilities  reflected in the contractual obligations table above  include products for which we are currently making periodic payments  including but not limited to  structured settlements  supplemental contracts  pension closeouts  group short and long term disability products and certain annuity contracts 
insurance liabilities  reflected in the contractual obligations table above  also include products for which we are not currently making periodic payments  but for which we believe the amount and timing of future payments is essentially fixed and determinable 
the contractholders generally cannot readily withdraw funds on these contracts 
these amounts include  but are not limited to  structured settlements  pension closeouts  certain annuity contracts  guaranteed interest contracts and funding agreements with contractually scheduled maturities and group long term disability products 
liabilities for future policy benefits of approximately billion  policyholder account balances of approximately billion and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of approximately billion as of december  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table 
such excluded liabilities include  but are not limited to  future policy benefits relating to life insurance products  individual disability income claim reserves that are coinsured  and endowments and policyholder account balances relating to deferred accumulation annuities and universal life products 
significant uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality  morbidity  expenses  persistency  investment returns  inflation and the timing of payments 
amounts included in insurance liabilities within the contractual obligations table reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders 
such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality  retirement  and other appropriate factors  but 
table of contents are undiscounted with respect to interest 
as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion included in the consolidated financial statements as of december  the liability amount in the consolidated financial statements reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above 
prudential financial remains obligated to disburse demutualization consideration for eligible policyholders that we have been unable to locate 
to the extent we continue to be unable to establish contact with these policyholders within a prescribed period of time specified by state escheat laws the funds must be remitted to governmental authorities 
the amounts reflected in the table above are reflective of state escheat laws as of december  these liabilities are reflected within other liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position 
we enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business  however  these purchase obligations are not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position as of december  off balance sheet arrangements guarantees in the course of our business  we provide certain guarantees and indemnities to third parties pursuant to which we may be contingently required to make payments now or in the future 
a number of guarantees provided by us relate to real estate investments  in which the investor has borrowed funds  and we have guaranteed their obligation to their lender 
in some cases  the investor is an affiliate  and in other cases the unaffiliated investor purchases the real estate investment from us 
we provide these guarantees to assist the investor in obtaining financing for the transaction on more beneficial terms 
our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was billion as of december  any payments that may become required of us under these guarantees would either first be reduced by proceeds received by the creditor on a sale of the assets  or would provide us with rights to obtain the assets 
these guarantees expire at various times over the next years 
as of december   no amounts were accrued as a result of our assessment that it is unlikely payments will be required 
certain contracts underwritten by the retirement segment s guaranteed products business include guarantees related to financial assets owned by the guaranteed party 
these contracts are accounted for as derivatives  at fair value  in accordance with sfas no 
as of december   such contracts in force carried a total guaranteed value of billion 
our commercial mortgage banking business provides guarantees related to debt instruments owned by the guaranteed party 
as of december   such arrangements carried a total guaranteed value of million  with remaining contractual maturities of up to years 
we anticipate the extinguishment of our obligation under these guarantees prior to maturity as we intend to aggregate and pool individual items for transfer to substitute guarantors 
these guarantees are secured by rights to properties valued at million as of december  as of december   we have accrued liabilities of million representing unearned fees on these guarantees 
we write credit default swaps requiring payment of principal due in exchange for the referenced credits  depending on the nature or occurrence of specified credit events for the referenced entities 
in the event of a specified credit event  our maximum amount at risk  assuming the value of the referenced credits become worthless  is million as of december  the credit default swaps generally have maturities of five years or less 
in connection with certain acquisitions  we agreed to pay additional consideration in future periods  based upon the attainment by the acquired entity of defined operating objectives 
in accordance with gaap  we do not accrue contingent consideration obligations prior to the attainment of the objectives 
as of december   maximum potential future consideration pursuant to such arrangements  to be resolved over the following five years  is million 
any such payments would result in increases in intangible assets  including goodwill 
we are also subject to other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements 
we have provided indemnities and guarantees related to acquisitions  dispositions  investments or other transactions that are 
table of contents triggered by  among other things  breaches of representations  warranties or covenants provided by us 
these obligations are typically subject to various time limitations  defined by the contract or by operation of law  such as statutes of limitation 
in some cases  the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations  while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable 
since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations  it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under these guarantees 
as of december   we have accrued liabilities of million associated with all other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements 
other contingent commitments in connection with our commercial mortgage banking business  we originate commercial mortgage loans 
as of december   we had outstanding commercial mortgage loan commitments with borrowers of billion 
in certain of these transactions  we prearrange that we will sell the loan to an investor after we fund the loan 
as of december   million of our commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans are subject to such arrangements 
we also have other commitments  some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control  including those at the discretion of our counterparties 
these other commitments amounted to billion as of december  reflected in these other commitments are billion of commitments to purchase or fund investments  including billion that we anticipate will be funded from the assets of our separate accounts 
other off balance sheet arrangements we do not have retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities  or variable interests in unconsolidated entities or other similar transactions  arrangements or relationships that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support  that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or our access to or requirements for capital resources 
in addition  we do not have relationships with any unconsolidated entities that are contractually limited to narrow activities that facilitate our transfer of or access to assets 
deferred policy acquisition costs we capitalize costs that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new insurance and annuity business 
these costs include commissions  costs to issue and underwrite the policies and certain variable field office expenses 
the capitalized amounts are known as deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac 
our total dac  including the impact of unrealized investment gains and losses  amounted to billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   approximately of our total dac relates to our individual life and annuities segment  approximately relates to our international insurance segment and approximately relates to our closed block business 
if we were to experience a significant decrease in asset values or increase in lapse or surrender rates on policies for which we amortize dac based on estimated gross margins or gross profits  such as participating and variable life insurance  we would expect acceleration of the amortization of dac for the affected blocks of policies 
additionally  for all policies on which we have outstanding dac  we would be required to evaluate whether this experience called into question our ability to recover all or a portion of the dac  and we would be required to accelerate the amortization for some or all of the dac if we concluded that we could not recover it 
an accelerated amortization of dac would negatively affect our reported earnings and level of capital under generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management  market risk and derivative instruments risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk  the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns on the underlying assets or liabilities 
we consider risk management an integral part of our core business 
market risk is the risk of change in the value of financial instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates or equity or commodity prices 
to varying degrees  the investment and trading activities supporting all of our products and services generate market risks 
the market risks incurred and our strategies for managing these risks vary by product 
with respect to non variable life insurance products  fixed rate annuities  the fixed rate options in our variable life insurance and annuity products  consumer banking products  and other finance businesses  we incur market risk primarily in the form of interest rate risk 
we manage this risk through asset liability management strategies that seek to match the interest rate sensitivity of the assets to that of the underlying liabilities 
our overall objective in these strategies is to limit the net change in value of assets and liabilities arising from interest rate movements 
while it is more difficult to measure the interest sensitivity of our insurance liabilities than that of the related assets  to the extent that we can measure such sensitivities we believe that interest rate movements will generate asset value changes that substantially offset changes in the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying products 
for variable annuities and variable life insurance products  excluding the fixed rate options in these products  mutual funds and most separate accounts  our main exposure to the market is the risk that asset management fees decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in prices of securities 
we also run the risk that asset management fees calculated by reference to performance could be lower 
for variable annuity and variable life insurance products with minimum guaranteed death and other benefits  we also face the risk that declines in the value of underlying investments as a result of changes in prices of securities may increase our net exposure to these death and other benefits under these contracts 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for financial services businesses by segment insurance division individual life and annuities for payments made under the guaranteed minimum death benefit provision of certain individual annuity contracts 
we manage our exposure to equity price risk relating to our general account investments primarily by seeking to match the risk profile of equity investments against risk adjusted equity market benchmarks 
we measure benchmark risk levels in terms of price volatility in relation to the market in general 
the sources of our exposure to market risk can be divided into two categories  other than trading activities conducted primarily in our insurance  annuity and guaranteed products operations  and trading activities conducted primarily in our equity and derivatives trading operations  as well as  historically  in our former domestic retail securities brokerage business 
as part of our management of both other than trading and trading market risks  we use a variety of risk management tools and techniques 
these include sensitivity and value at risk  or var  measures  position and other limits based on type of risk  and various hedging methods 
other than trading activities we hold the majority of our assets for other than trading activities in our segments that offer insurance  annuities and guaranteed products 
we incorporate asset liability management techniques and other risk management policies and limits into the process of investing our assets 
we use derivatives for hedging purposes in the asset liability management process 
insurance  annuities and guaranteed products asset liability management we seek to maintain interest rate and equity exposures within established ranges  which we periodically adjust based on market conditions and the design of related products sold to customers 
our risk managers establish investment risk limits for exposures to any issuer  geographic region  type of security or industry sector and oversee efforts to manage risk within policy constraints set by management and approved by the investment committee of the board of directors 

table of contents we use duration and convexity analyses to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes 
duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates 
convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates 
we seek to manage our interest rate exposure by legal entity by matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes  or controlling duration mismatch of assets and liabilities 
we have target duration mismatch constraints for each entity 
as of december  and  the difference between the pre tax duration of assets and the target duration of liabilities in our duration managed portfolios was within our constraint limits 
we consider risk based capital implications in our asset liability management strategies 
we also perform portfolio stress testing as part of our regulatory cash flow testing 
in this testing  we evaluate the impact of altering our interest sensitive assumptions under various moderately adverse interest rate environments 
these interest sensitive assumptions relate to the timing and amount of redemptions and prepayments of fixed income securities and lapses and surrenders of insurance products and the potential impact of any guaranteed minimum interest rates 
we evaluate any shortfalls that this cash flow testing reveals to determine if we need to increase statutory reserves or adjust portfolio management strategies 
market risk related to interest rates our other than trading assets that subject us to interest rate risk include primarily fixed maturity securities  commercial loans and policy loans 
in the aggregate  the carrying value of these assets represented of our consolidated assets  other than assets that we held in separate accounts  as of december  and as of december  with respect to other than trading liabilities  we are exposed to interest rate risk through policyholder account balances relating to interest sensitive life insurance  annuity and investment type contracts and through outstanding short term and long term debt 
we assess interest rate sensitivity for other than trading financial assets  financial liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward basis point parallel shifts in the yield curve from prevailing interest rates 
the following tables set forth the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical basis point upward shift as of december  and  because this scenario results in the greatest net exposure to interest rate risk of the hypothetical scenarios tested at those dates 
while the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed income markets  it is a near term  reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events 
these test scenarios do not measure the changes in value that could result from non parallel shifts in the yield curve  which we would expect to produce different changes in discount rates for different maturities 
as a result  the actual loss in fair value from a basis point change in interest rates could be different from that indicated by these calculations

the billion increase in the total estimated potential loss as of december  from december  resulted primarily from the increase in our portfolio of fixed maturities including those acquired as part of the purchase of the retirement business of cigna corporation during the estimated changes in fair values of our financial assets shown above relate primarily to assets invested to support our insurance liabilities  but do not include assets associated with products for which investment risk is borne primarily by the contractholders rather than by us 
market risk related to equity prices we actively manage investment equity price risk against benchmarks in respective markets 
we benchmark our return on equity holdings against a blend of market indices  mainly the s p and russell  and we target price sensitivities that approximate those of the benchmark indices 
we estimate our equity price risk from a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels and measure this risk in terms of the decline in fair market value of equity securities we hold 
using this methodology  our estimated equity price risk as of december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
our estimated equity price risk using this methodology as of december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
in calculating these amounts  we exclude equity securities related to products for which the investment risk is borne primarily by the contractholder rather than by us 
while these scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future performance of equity markets or of our equity portfolio  they represent near term reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact of such events 
market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our general account investment portfolios and through our operations in foreign countries 
in our international life insurance business  we generally invest in assets denominated in the same currencies as our insurance liabilities  which mitigates our foreign currency exchange rate risk for these operations 
our exposure to foreign currency risk within the general account investment portfolios supporting our us insurance operations arises primarily from purchased investments that are denominated or payable in foreign 
table of contents currencies 
we generally hedge substantially all foreign currency denominated fixed income investments supporting our us operations into us dollars in order to mitigate the risk that the fair value of these investments fluctuates as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our equity investments in unaffiliated foreign entities 
our operations in foreign countries create two additional sources of foreign currency risk 
first  we reflect the operating results of our foreign branches and subsidiaries in our financial statements based on the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
we hedge some of these foreign currency operating results as part of our overall risk management strategy 
we generally hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations primarily in japan and korea 
second  we translate our equity investment in foreign branches and subsidiaries into us dollars using the foreign currency exchange rate at the financial statement period end date 
we have chosen to partially hedge this exposure 
we actively manage investment foreign currency exchange rate risk within specified limits at the consolidated level using var based analysis 
this statistical technique estimates  at a specified confidence level  the potential pre tax loss in portfolio market value that could occur over an assumed time horizon due to adverse market movements 
we calculate this using a variance covariance approach 
we calculate var estimates of exposure to loss from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates for one month time periods 
our estimated var as of december  for foreign currency assets not hedged to us dollars within our general account investment portfolios supporting our us insurance operations  including the portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries not hedged  measured at the confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from billion to billion 
our estimated var as of december  for foreign currency assets not hedged to us dollars within our general account investment portfolios supporting our us insurance operations  including the portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries not hedged  measured at the confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from million to million 
our average monthly var for foreign currency assets not hedged to us dollars within our general account investment portfolios supporting our us insurance operations  including the portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries not hedged  from foreign currency exchange rate movements  measured at the confidence level over a one month time horizon  was million during and million during these calculations use historical price volatilities and correlation data at a confidence level 
we discuss limitations of var models below 
our estimated var for instruments used to hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations  measured at the confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million as of december  and million as of december  derivatives derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates  foreign exchange rates  financial indices  or the prices of securities or commodities 
derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps  futures  options and forward contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our derivative activities as of december  and under insurance statutes  our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities  to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities 
these statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily to seek to reduce market risk from changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates  and to alter interest rate or foreign currency exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities 
trading activities we engage in trading activities primarily in connection with our equity and derivatives trading operations  as well as  historically  in our former domestic retail securities brokerage business 
we maintain trading positions 
table of contents in various equity  foreign exchange instruments and commodities  primarily to facilitate transactions for our clients 
market risk affects the values of our trading positions through fluctuations in absolute or relative interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  securities and commodity prices 
we seek to use short security positions and forwards  futures  options and other derivatives to limit exposure to interest rate and other market risks 
we also trade derivative financial instruments that allow our clients to manage exposure to interest rate  currency and other market risks 
our derivative transactions involve both exchange listed and over the counter contracts and are generally short term in duration 
we act both as a broker  buying and selling exchange listed contracts for our customers  and as a dealer  by entering into futures and security transactions as a principal 
as a broker  we assume counterparty and credit risks that we seek to mitigate by using margin or other credit enhancements and by establishing trading limits and credit lines 
as a dealer  we are subject to market risk as well as counterparty and credit risk 
we manage the market risk associated with trading activities through hedging activities and formal policies  risk and position limits  counterparty and credit limits  daily position monitoring  and other forms of risk management 
value at risk var is one of the tools we use to monitor and manage our exposure to the market risk of our trading activities 
we calculate a var that encompasses our trading activities using a confidence level 
the var method incorporates the risk factors to which the market value of our trading activities is exposed  which consist of interest rates  including credit spreads  foreign exchange rates  equity prices and commodity prices  estimates of volatilities from historical data  the sensitivity of our trading activities to changes in those market factors and the correlations of those factors 
we test our var model by comparing actual adverse results to those estimated by the var model with a confidence level over a one day time horizon 
the var for our trading activities expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value at the confidence level over a one day time horizon was million as of december  and million as of december  the average daily var for our trading activities  expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value with a confidence level over a one day time horizon  was million during and million during the following table sets forth a breakdown of this var by risk component as follows as of december  average for as of december  average for in millions interest rate risk equity risk commodities risk total as of december  and  and during the years then ended  var from foreign currency exchange rate risk in our trading activities was immaterial 
limitations of var models although var models are a recognized tool for risk management  they have inherent limitations  including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns 
accordingly  you should not view var models as a predictor of future results 
we may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time  and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by our var models 
a var model does not estimate the greatest possible loss 
the results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the judgment of our risk management personnel
