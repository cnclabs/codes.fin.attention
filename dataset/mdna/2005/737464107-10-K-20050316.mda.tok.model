table of contents current development activity at december   the company had one community under development  containing apartment and for sale condominium units 
this community is summarized in the table below 
costs estimated estimated incurred quarter of quarter of quarter of number of construction as of construction first units stabilized metropolitan area units cost start available occupancy in millions construction lease up communities washington dc post carlyle tm apartments and condominiums q q q construction lease up communities the company defines stabilized occupancy for apartment communities as the earlier to occur of i the attainment of physical occupancy on the first day of any month or ii one year after completion of construction 
the condominium component of the project  consisting of units  will be developed through a taxable reit subsidiary in a majority owned joint venture with a washington dc based developer 
competition all of the company s apartment and for sale condominium communities are located in developed markets that include other upscale apartments and for sale condominium projects owned by numerous public and private companies 
some of these companies may have substantially greater resources and greater access to capital than the company  allowing them to grow at rates greater than the company 
the number of competitive upscale apartment and for sale condominium properties and companies in a particular market could have a material effect on the company s ability to lease apartment units at its apartment communities  including any newly developed or acquired communities  and on the rents charged  and could have a material effect on the company s ability to sell for sale condominium units and on the selling prices of such units 
in addition  other forms of residential properties  including single family housing  condominiums and town homes  provide housing alternatives to potential residents of upscale apartment communities 
the company competes for residents in its apartment communities based on its high level of resident service  the quality of its apartment communities including its landscaping and amenity offerings and the desirability of its locations 
resident leases at its apartment communities are priced competitively based on market conditions  supply and demand characteristics  and the quality and resident service offerings of its communities 
the company does not seek to compete solely on the basis of providing the low cost solution for all residents 
americans with disabilities act the company s apartment communities and any newly acquired apartment communities must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act the ada to the extent that such properties are public accommodations and or commercial facilities as defined by the ada 
compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of the company s apartment communities where such removal is readily achievable 
the ada does not  however  consider residential properties  such as apartment communities  to be public accommodations or commercial facilities  except to the extent portions of such facilities  such as the leasing office  are open to the public 
the company believes that its properties comply  in all material respects  with all present requirements under the ada and applicable state laws 
noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
if required to make material additional changes  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
environmental regulations the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations that apply to the development of real property  including construction activities  the ownership of real property  and the operation of multifamily apartment and for sale condominium communities 
post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents the company has instituted a policy that requires an environmental investigation of each property that it considers for purchase or that it owns and plans to develop 
the environmental investigation is conducted by a qualified third party environmental consultant in accordance with recognized industry standards 
the environmental investigation report is reviewed by the company and counsel prior to purchase and or development of any property 
if the environmental investigation identifies evidence of potentially significant environmental contamination that merits additional investigation  sampling of the property is performed by the environmental consultant 
if necessary  remediation or migration of contamination  including removal of underground storage tanks  is undertaken either prior to development or at another appropriate time 
when performing remediation activities  the company is subject to a variety of environmental requirements 
in some cases  the company obtains state approval of the selected remediation measures by entering into voluntary environmental cleanup programs administered by state agencies 
in developing properties and constructing apartment and for sale condominium communities  the company utilizes independent environmental consultants to determine whether there are any flood plains  wetlands or other environmentally sensitive areas that are part of the property to be developed 
if flood plains are identified  development and construction work is planned so that flood plain areas are preserved or alternative flood plain capacity is created in conformance with federal and local flood plain management requirements 
if wetlands or other environmentally sensitive areas are identified  the company plans and conducts its development and construction activities and obtains the necessary permits and authorizations in compliance with applicable legal standards 
in some cases  however  the presence of wetlands and or other environmentally sensitive areas could preclude  severely limit  or otherwise alter the proposed site development and construction activities 
storm water discharge from a construction site is subject to the storm water permit requirements mandated under the clean water act 
in most jurisdictions  the state administers the permit programs 
the company currently anticipates that it will be able to obtain and materially comply with any storm water permits required for new development 
the company has obtained and is in material compliance with the construction site storm water permits required for its existing development activities 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  usc sec 
et seq 
cercla  and comparable state laws subject the owner or operator of real property or a facility and persons who arranged for off site disposal activities to claims or liability for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances that are released at  in  on  under  or from real property or a facility 
in addition to claims for cleanup costs  the presence of hazardous substances on or the release of hazardous substances from a property or a facility could result in a claim by a private party for personal injury or property damage or could result in a claim from a governmental agency for other damages 
liability under cercla and comparable state laws can be imposed on the owner or the operator of real property or a facility without regard to fault or even knowledge of the release of hazardous substances and other regulated materials on  at  in  under  or from the property or facility 
environmental liabilities associated with hazardous substances also could be imposed on the company under other applicable environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state laws  or common law principles 
the presence of hazardous substances in amounts requiring response action or the failure to undertake necessary remediation may adversely affect the owner s ability to use or sell real estate or borrow money using such real estate as collateral 
various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the company s ongoing operation of its communities 
such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos containing materials in buildings  management of surfaces with lead based paint and notices to residents about the lead based paint  use of active underground petroleum storage tanks  and waste management activities 
the failure to comply with such requirements could subject the company to a government enforcement action and or claims for damages by a private party 
the company has not been notified by any governmental authority of any material noncompliance  claim  or liability in connection with environmental conditions associated with any of its apartment and for sale condominium communities 
the company has not been notified of a material claim for personal injury or property damage by a private party relating to any of its apartment and for sale condominium communities in connection with environmental conditions 
the company is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of its apartment and for sale condominium communities that could be considered to be material 
it is possible  however  that the environmental investigations of the company s properties might not have revealed all potential environmental liabilities associated with the company s real property and its apartment and for sale condominium communities or the company might have underestimated any potential environmental issues post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents identified in the investigations 
it is also possible that future environmental laws  ordinances  or regulations or new interpretations of existing environmental laws  ordinances  or regulations will impose material environmental liabilities on the company  the current environmental conditions of properties that the company owns or operates will be affected adversely by hazardous substances associated with other nearby properties or the actions of third parties unrelated to the company  or our residents and or commercial tenants may engage in activities prohibited by their leases or otherwise expose the company to liability under applicable environmental laws  ordinances  or regulations 
the costs of defending any future environmental claims  performing any future environmental remediation  satisfying any such environmental liabilities  or responding to any changed environmental conditions could materially adversely affect the company s financial conditions and results of operations

risk factors the following risk factors apply to post properties  inc the company and post apartment homes  lp the operating partnership 
all indebtedness described in the risk factors has been incurred by the operating partnership 
unfavorable changes in apartment markets and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates 
market and economic conditions in the various metropolitan areas of the united states where the company operates  particularly atlanta  georgia  dallas  texas  tampa  florida and the greater washington  dc area where a substantial majority of the company s apartment communities are located  may significantly affect occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore profitability 
factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following the economic climate  which may be adversely impacted by a reduction in jobs  industry slowdowns and other factors  local conditions  such as oversupply of  or reduced demand for  apartment homes  continued or worsened weak economic and market conditions that simultaneously affect one or more of the company s geographic markets  declines in household formation  favorable residential mortgage rates  rent control or stabilization laws  or other laws regulating rental housing  which could prevent the company from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs  and competition from other available apartments and other housing alternatives and changes in market rental rates 
any of these factors could adversely affect the company s ability to achieve desired operating results from its communities 
development and construction risks could impact the company s profitability 
the company intends to continue to develop and construct apartment communities and may convert existing apartment communities into condominiums or develop for sale condominium housing 
development activities may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties 
the company s development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks the company may be unable to obtain  or face delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased development costs  post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents the company may incur construction costs for a property that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs  which could make completion of the property uneconomical  and the company may not be able to increase rents or for sale condominium unit sales prices to compensate for the increase in construction costs  the company may abandon development opportunities that it has already begun to explore  and it may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring those opportunities  the company has been and may continue to be unable to complete construction and lease up of a community on schedule and meet financial goals for development projects  because occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including market and economic conditions  the company may be unable to meet its profitability goals for that community  and land costs and construction costs have been increasing in the company s existing markets  and may continue to increase in the future and  in some cases  the costs of upgrading acquired communities have  and may continue to  exceed original estimates and the company may be unable to charge rents  or sales prices with respect to for sale condominium product  that would compensate for these increases in costs 
possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit the company s operational and financial flexibility 
purchasers may not be willing to pay acceptable prices for apartment communities that the company wishes to sell 
a weak market may limit the company s ability to change its portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions 
also  if the company is unable to sell apartment communities or if it can only sell apartment communities at prices lower than are generally acceptable  then the company may have to take on additional leverage in order to provide adequate capital to execute its development and construction and acquisitions strategy 
furthermore  a portion of the proceeds from the company s overall property sales in the future may be held in escrow accounts in order for some sales to qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  the company may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from property sales 
changing interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of the company s securities 
the company has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  debt bearing interest at rates that vary with market interest rates 
therefore  if interest rates increase  the company s interest costs will rise to the extent its variable rate debt is not hedged effectively 
further  while the company s stated goal is to limit variable rate debt to not more than to of total indebtedness  management may adjust these levels over time 
in addition  an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of the company s securities to demand a higher annual yield  which could adversely affect the market price of the company s common and preferred stock and debt securities 
failure to generate sufficient cash flows could affect the company s debt financing and create refinancing risk 
the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest 
although the company may be able to use cash flow to make future principal payments  it cannot assure investors that sufficient cash flow will be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy the distribution requirements that the company must satisfy in order to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes 
the following factors  among others  may affect the cash flows generated by the company s apartment communities the national and local economies  local real estate market conditions  such as an oversupply of apartment homes  the perceptions by prospective residents of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the company s communities and the neighborhoods in which they are located  the company s ability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  and rental expenses  including real estate taxes and utilities 
post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents expenses associated with the company s investment in apartment communities  such as debt service  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in cash flows from operations from that community 
if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and the company is unable to make the mortgage payments  the company could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgagee 
the company is likely to need to refinance at least a portion of its outstanding debt as it matures 
there is a risk that the company may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt 
as of december   the company had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of approximately million and senior unsecured debt of approximately million of which approximately million matures in 
the company could become more highly leveraged which could result in an increased risk of default and in an increase in its debt service requirements 
the company s stated goal is to generally maintain total effective leverage debt and preferred equity as a percentage of undepreciated real estate assets in a range of to  to generally limit variable rate indebtedness as a percentage of total indebtedness to not more than to of aggregate indebtedness  and to maintain adequate liquidity through the company s unsecured lines of credit 
at december   the company s total effective leverage debt and preferred equity as a percentage of undepreciated real estate assets and the company s total variable rate indebtedness as a percentage of total indebtedness were within or below these ranges 
if management adjusts the company s stated goal in the future  the company could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect funds from operations  the company s ability to make expected distributions to its shareholders and the operating partnership s ability to make expected distributions to its limited partners and in an increased risk of default on the obligations of the company and the operating partnership 
in addition  the company s and the operating partnership s ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in bank and other credit agreements and in the company s outstanding senior unsecured notes 
the company manages its debt to be in compliance with its stated policy and with these debt covenants  but subject to compliance with these covenants  the company may increase the amount of outstanding debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in the company s ability to service the additional debt 
accordingly  the company could become more leveraged  resulting in an increased risk of default on its obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements  both of which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 
debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to the company s shareholders 
the company s ability to execute its business strategy depends on its access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt  and equity financing  including common and preferred equity 
debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts  or on favorable terms or at all 
if the company issues additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt  the interests of existing shareholders could be diluted 
acquired apartment communities may not achieve anticipated results 
the company may selectively acquire apartment communities that meet its investment criteria 
the company s acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks an acquired community may fail to achieve expected occupancy and rental rates and may fail to perform as expected  the company may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations  and the company s estimates of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate  causing the company to fail to meet its profitability goals 
increased competition and increased affordability of residential homes could limit the company s ability to retain its residents  lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 
the company s apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents  including other apartment communities and single family rental homes  as well as owner occupied single and multi family homes 
competitive housing in a particular area and the increasing affordability of owner occupied single and multi family homes caused by declining mortgage interest rates and government programs to promote post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents home ownership could adversely affect the company s ability to retain its residents  lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 
expansion of the company s operations into condominium conversion and for sale condominium housing involves new business risks and challenges for management 
expansion into condominium conversions and for sale condominium housing is a new area of the company s operations 
the company s ability to successfully complete a condominium conversion or other for sale housing project  sell the units and achieve management s economic goals in connection with the transaction is subject to various risks and challenges  which if they materialize  may have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition including the inability to obtain approvals to rezone the property and releases from financing obligations and increases in costs resulting from delays in obtaining such approvals and releases  increases in costs of improving the property  lack of demand by prospective buyers  over supply of condominiums in a given market  the inability of buyers to qualify for financing  lower than anticipated sale prices  the inability to close on sales of individual units under contract  competition from other condominiums and other types of residential housing  and liability claims 
in addition  if the company is unable to sell for sale units  the expenses and carrying costs associated with the ownership of such units would continue 
limited investment opportunities could adversely affect the company s growth 
the company expects that other real estate investors will compete to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties 
these competitors include insurance companies  pension and investment funds  developer partnerships  investment companies and other apartment reits 
this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that the company would likely pursue  and competitors may have greater resources than the company 
as a result  the company may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms  which could adversely affect its growth 
the company may not be able to maintain its current dividend level 
for the full year of  management of the company currently expects to maintain its current quarterly dividend payment rate to common shareholders of per share 
at this dividend rate  the company currently expects that net cash flows from operations reduced by annual operating capital expenditures for will not be sufficient to fund the dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders by approximately to million 
the company intends to use primarily the proceeds from asset including condominium sales to fund the additional cash flow necessary to fully fund the dividend payments to common shareholders 
in prior periods  the additional funding  in excess of cash flows from operating activities less operating capital expenditures  required to pay the quarterly dividends was funded through a combination of line of credit borrowings and proceeds from asset sales 
the company reduced the level of its quarterly dividend from per share to per share effective with the quarterly dividend paid for the first quarter of the company s board of directors reviews the dividend quarterly  and there can be no assurance that the current dividend level will be maintained 
interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges 
from time to time when the company anticipates issuing debt securities  it may seek to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
the company may do this to increase the predictability of its financing costs 
also  from time to time  the company may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit its exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates 
if the pricing of new debt securities is not within the parameters of  or market interest rates produce a lower interest cost than the company incurs under  a particular interest rate hedging contract  the contract is ineffective 
furthermore  the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents may in the future involve material charges 
these charges are typically related to the extent and timing of fluctuations in interest rates 
despite the company s efforts to minimize its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company cannot guarantee that it will maintain coverage for all of its outstanding indebtedness at any particular time 
if the company does not effectively protect itself from this risk  it may be subject to increased interest costs resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
failure to succeed in new markets may limit the company s growth 
the company may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of its existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise 
the company s historical experience in its existing markets does not ensure that it will be able to operate successfully in new markets 
the company may be exposed to a variety of risks if it chooses to enter new markets 
these risks include  among others an inability to evaluate accurately local apartment market conditions and local economies  an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities  an inability to hire and retain key personnel  and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 
any weaknesses identified in the company s system of internal controls by the company and its independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  the company s independent registered public accounting firm must report on management s evaluation of those controls 
in future periods  the company may identify deficiencies in its system of internal controls over financial reporting that may require remediation 
there can be no assurances that any such future deficiencies identified may not be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that would be required to be reported in future periods 
losses from natural catastrophes may exceed insurance coverage 
the company carries comprehensive liability  fire  flood  extended coverage and rental loss insurance on its properties  which are believed to be of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets 
the company intends to obtain similar coverage for properties acquired in the future 
however  some losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as losses from floods or earthquakes  may be subject to limitations 
the company exercises discretion in determining amounts  coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance  with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on its investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms  however  the company may not be able to maintain its insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect it against potential losses 
further  the company s insurance costs could increase in future periods 
if the company suffers a substantial loss  its insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of the lost investment 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 
potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 
the company is in the business of owning  operating  developing  acquiring and  from time to time  selling real estate 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  as a current or former owner or operator  the company could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances  often regardless of its knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of its current or former ownership or operation of the real estate 
in addition  the company could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination 
these costs could be substantial  and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment 
the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect the company s ability to borrow against  sell or rent an affected property 
post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to the company s properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost 
the americans with disabilities act  the fair housing act of and other federal  state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons 
noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants 
these laws may require the company to modify its existing properties 
these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require the company to add other structural features that increase construction costs 
legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by disabled persons 
the company cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws  which may be substantial 
the company may fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
the company s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes depends upon its ability to meet on a continuing basis  through actual annual operating results  distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership  the various qualification tests and organizational requirements imposed upon reits under the internal revenue code 
the company believes that it has qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended december   and plans to continue to meet the requirements to qualify as a reit in the future 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
the company cannot guarantee  therefore  that it has qualified or will continue to qualify in the future as a reit 
the determination that the company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within the company s control 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the company s reit status 
furthermore  congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  and the courts might issue new decisions that make it more difficult  or impossible  for the company to remain qualified as a reit 
the company does not believe  however  that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize its reit status 
if the company were to fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year  and certain relief provisions of the internal revenue code did not apply  the company would be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates  leaving less money available for distributions to its shareholders 
in addition  distributions to shareholders in any year in which the company failed to qualify would not be deductible by the company for federal income tax purposes nor would they be required to be made 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  the company also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a reit 
it is not possible to predict whether in all circumstances the company would be entitled to such statutory relief 
the company s failure to qualify as a reit likely would have a significant adverse effect on the value of its securities 
the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
management believes that the operating partnership qualifies  and has so qualified since its formation  as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation 
no assurance can be provided  however  that the irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge 
if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates 
in addition  the treatment of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause the company to fail to qualify as a reit 
see the company may fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes above 
the company s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets for impairment indicators 
factors considered in evaluating impairment of the company s existing real estate assets held for investment include significant declines in property operating profits  recurring property operating losses and other significant adverse changes in general market conditions that are considered permanent in nature 
generally  a real estate asset held for investment is not considered impaired if the undiscounted  estimated future cash flows of the asset over its estimated holding period are in excess of the asset s net book value at the balance sheet date 
assumptions used to estimate annual and residual cash flow and the estimated holding period of such assets require the judgment of management 
post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents in and in prior years  the company recorded impairment charges on assets held for investment and assets designated as held for sale 
there can be no assurance that the company will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of its assets 
for the years ended december   and  management believes it has applied reasonable estimates and judgments in determining the proper classification of its real estate assets 
however  should external or internal circumstances change requiring the need to shorten the holding periods or adjust the estimated future cash flows of certain of the company s assets  the company could be required to record additional impairment charges 
if any real estate asset held for investment is considered impaired  a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value  less selling costs 
any future impairment could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and funds from operations in the period in which the charge is taken 
the company s shareholders may not be able to effect a change in control 
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the company and the partnership agreement of the operating partnership contain a number of provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company s shareholders or otherwise be in their best interests  including the following preferred shares 
the company s articles of incorporation provide that the company has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  of which  were outstanding as of december  the board of directors has the authority  without the approval of the shareholders  to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to establish the preferences and rights of such shares 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company  even if a change of control were in the shareholders interest 
consent rights of the unitholders 
under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership  the company may not merge or consolidate with another entity unless the merger includes the merger of the operating partnership  which requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding units of the operating partnership 
if the company were to ever hold less than a majority of the units  this voting requirement might limit the possibility for an acquisition or a change of control 
ownership limit 
one of the requirements for maintenance of the company s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes is that no more than in value of its outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals  including entities specified in the internal revenue code  during the last half of any taxable year 
to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the ownership limit under the company s articles of incorporation prohibits ownership  directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the internal revenue code  by any person or persons acting as a group of more than of the issued and outstanding shares of the company s common stock  subject to certain exceptions  including an exception for shares of common stock held by mr 
john a 
williams and mr 
john t 
glover  the company s former chairman and former vice chairman and certain investors for which the company has waived the ownership limit 
together  these limitations are referred to as the ownership limit 
further  the company s articles of incorporation include provisions allowing it to stop transfers of and redeem its shares that are intended to assist the company in complying with these requirements 
while the company has committed that it will not utilize the ownership limit in its articles of incorporation as an anti takeover device  these provisions could still deter  delay or defer someone from taking control of the company 
terrorist attacks and the possibility of wider armed conflict may have an adverse effect on the company s business and operating results and could decrease the value of the company s assets 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact one or more of the company s apartment communities could significantly affect the company s ability to operate those communities and thereby impair its ability to achieve the company s expected results 
further  the company s insurance coverage may not cover any losses caused by a terrorist attack 
in addition  the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
finally  if the united states enters into and remains engaged in a wider armed conflict  the company s business and operating results could be adversely effected

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except apartment unit data company overview post properties  inc and its subsidiaries develop  own and manage upscale multifamily apartment communities in selected markets in the united states 
as used in this report  the term company includes post properties  inc and its subsidiaries  including post apartment homes  lp the operating partnership  unless the context indicates otherwise 
the company  through its wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner and owns a majority interest in the operating partnership which  through its subsidiaries  conducts substantially all of the on going operations of the company 
at december   the company owned  apartment units in apartment communities  including apartment units in three communities held in unconsolidated entities  including apartment units currently under development in one community and including units in one community that will be converted into for sale condominium homes through a taxable reit subsidiary starting in the company is also developing for sale condominium homes through a taxable reit subsidiary 
subsequent to december   the company announced plans to convert another community  containing units  into for sale condominium homes through a taxable reit subsidiary 
at december   approximately   and on a unit basis of the company s operating communities were located in the atlanta  dallas  tampa and the greater washington dc metropolitan areas  respectively 
the company has elected to qualify and operate as a self administrated and self managed real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes 
a reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and  through payments of dividends to shareholders  in practical effect is not subject to federal income taxes at the corporate level 
at december   the company owned approximately of the common limited partnership interests common units in the operating partnership 
common units held by persons other than the company represented a common minority interest in the operating partnership 
over the past several years  the multifamily apartment sector has been adversely impacted by the supply of multifamily apartments outpacing demand 
while the construction of new multifamily apartments had continued at historical norms due primarily to the availability of capital and the low interest rate environment  demand for multifamily apartments was adversely impacted by overall weakness in the economy and the job market  as well as increased rates of homeownership due primarily to historically low mortgage interest rates 
these factors contributed to the company reporting declining apartment rental rates  same store revenue and net operating income since in  however  there have been gradual signs of stabilization as the company has reported increased year over year average economic occupancy rates  positive growth in year over year same store revenues in the later half of the year and positive growth in year over year same store net operating income in the fourth quarter 
on a sequential basis  the company has also reported positive growth in quarterly average effective rents during the later half of see results of operations below where the company s operating results are discussed in more detail 
over the past several years  the company has also been a net seller of apartment assets in an effort to exploit opportunities to harvest value and recycle capital through the sale of non core assets that no longer met the company s growth objectives 
the company s asset sales program is consistent with its strategy of reducing its concentration in atlanta  georgia and dallas  texas  building critical mass in fewer markets and leveraging the post brand in order to improve operating efficiencies 
the company has redeployed capital raised from asset sales to strengthen its balance sheet  through the reduction of high coupon preferred equity and debt  and to reinvest in assets that the company believes demonstrate better growth potential  such as the company s acquisition of a unit apartment community in the tysons corner submarket of suburban washington  dc and the company s start of a unit apartment and for sale condominium development project in in the master planned carlyle submarket of suburban washington  dc at december   the company had classified five apartment communities  containing  units as held for sale in addition to one community being converted to condominiums 
subsequent to december   the company classified as held for sale one additional apartment community  containing  units 
as of february   the company is currently marketing for sale six apartment communities in addition to the condominium conversion activities at two communities discussed below  containing a total of  units  that it expects to sell in for aggregate gross purchase prices in the range of approximately  to  including the assumption and or repayment of approximately  of tax exempt secured indebtedness encumbering three of post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents the communities 
four of the six communities currently held for sale are garden style communities located in atlanta  georgia and dallas  texas  containing  units and with an average age of approximately years 
one of the properties held for sale is the company s only property located in nashville  tennessee 
the remaining property held for sale is an urban redevelopment community located in dallas  texas 
the company s planned asset sales are expected to close in in early  the company  through a taxable reit subsidiary  commenced the conversion of two existing apartment communities to for sale condominium housing units 
these communities are located in dallas  texas and tampa  florida 
the company transferred these communities to a taxable reit subsidiary at their aggregate fair value of approximately  the company expects to begin selling these for sale condominium units in the company also announced the launch of a new for sale housing brand  post preferred homes tm  which will serve as the new unified marketing umbrella for the company s for sale ventures  including developing new communities  such as the condominiums at carlyle square  and converting existing assets into upscale for sale housing in several key markets 
the company expects to utilize net asset sales proceeds including net proceeds from sales of for sale condominium units primarily to repay a portion of its debt that matures in the company may also consider utilizing asset sales proceeds to repurchase its common stock  if the company is able to do so at prices it considers attractive relative to its estimates of net asset value per share  or to pay a special dividend to common shareholders depending on the level of undistributed taxable gains  if any  during based on current expectations regarding the timing of asset sales and related capital reinvestment activities  the company expects that disposition activities will result in earnings dilution in  in part  due to the assumption and or repayment of low floater  tax exempt debt encumbering three of the atlanta  georgia communities held for sale 
the timing and amount of these asset sales  and the related capital reinvestment activities  could significantly impact short term operating results 
there can be no assurances that these asset sales including the sale of for sale condominium units will close 
see liquidity and capital resources below where the company s capital activities are discussed in more detail 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and with all of the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report

critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements in the preparation of financial statements and in the determination of company operating performance  the company utilizes certain significant accounting polices and these accounting policies are discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
also discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  there are several new accounting pronouncements issued in and that may have an impact on future reported results 
the potential impact of certain new pronouncements on the company is discussed below and in the consolidated financial statements 
as the company is in the business of developing  owning and managing apartment communities  its critical accounting policies  ones that are subject to significant management estimates and adjustments  relate to cost capitalization and asset impairment evaluation 
for communities under development  the company capitalizes interest  real estate taxes  and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to apartment communities under development and construction 
interest capitalized to projects under development can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on the level of projects under development and to a lesser extent  changes in the weighted average interest rate used in the calculation 
for the years ended december   and  the company capitalized interest totaling   and  respectively 
this decline was principally due to an intentional reduction in the size of the company s development pipeline 
the weighted average interest rates used in the calculation of the capitalized interest amounts ranged from in to in and  as a result  were not the primary driver of the reduction in interest capitalization discussed above 
in future periods  the company anticipates an increase in development activity which will result in increased interest capitalization over levels 
aggregate interest capitalization increases are expected even as the average interest rate used in the calculation is expected to decline 
the decline in the weighted average rate is expected to result from the maturity of high rate debt in  the expected refinancing of a portion of this debt at lower rates and expected higher average balances outstanding under the company s lower variable rate credit facilities 
post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents internal personnel and associated costs are capitalized to the projects under development based upon the effort identifiable with such projects 
as the company intentionally slowed its development efforts due to a weaker economic environment in and  the company capitalized less to development projects 
the company elected to retain certain development personnel and capabilities during this period in order to position the company for increased development activities in future years 
in and  the company expensed  and  respectively  of development personnel and associated costs 
if future development volume increases over levels  some or all of such costs may be capitalized to development projects 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets using the methodology summarized in its accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under current accounting literature  the evaluation of the recoverability of the company s real estate assets requires the judgment of company management in the determination of the value of the future cash flows expected from the assets and the estimated holding period for the assets 
the company uses market capitalization rates to determine the estimated residual value of its real estate assets capitalization rates ranged from to at december  and  generally  takes a long term view on the holding period of its assets unless specific facts and considerations warrant shorter holding periods expected sales  departures from certain markets  etc 
at december  and  management believes it has applied reasonable estimates and judgments in determining the proper classification of its real estate assets 
should external or internal circumstances change requiring the need to shorten the holding periods or adjust the estimated future cash flows of certain of the company s assets  the company could be required to record future impairment charges 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company recorded impairment losses in and on assets held for sale or for investment under the application of its policies

results of operations the following discussion of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of operations  the accompanying selected financial data and the community operations segment performance information included below 
the company s revenues and earnings are generated primarily from the operation of its apartment communities 
for purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance  the company categorizes its operating communities based on the period each community reaches stabilized occupancy 
the company generally considers a community to have achieved stabilized occupancy on the earlier to occur of attainment of physical occupancy on the first day of any month or one year after completion of construction 
for the year ended december   the company s portfolio of operating apartment communities  excluding three communities held in unconsolidated entities and six communities held for sale  consisted of the following communities that were completed and stabilized for all of the current and prior year  two communities that achieved full stabilization during  one community that was in the lease up stage during the year  and one community that was acquired in sold communities include communities sold in that were not reflected in discontinued operations under sfas no 
see discussion under discontinued operations 
these operating segments exclude the operations of apartment communities classified as discontinued operations and apartment communities held in unconsolidated entities for the years presented 
post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents the company has adopted an accounting policy related to communities in the lease up stage whereby substantially all operating expenses including pre opening marketing and management and leasing personnel expenses are expensed as incurred 
during the lease up phase  the sum of interest expense on completed units and other operating expenses including pre opening marketing and management and leasing personnel expenses will initially exceed rental revenues  resulting in a lease up deficit  which continues until such time as rental revenues exceed such expenses 
lease up deficits for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
in order to evaluate the operating performance of its communities for the comparative years listed below  the company has presented financial information which summarizes the rental and other revenues  property operating and maintenance expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and net operating income on a comparative basis for all of its operating communities and for its stabilized operating communities 
net operating income is a supplemental non gaap financial measure

all other expenditures necessary to maintain a community in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred

the condominium component of the project  consisting of units  will be developed through a taxable reit subsidiary in a majority owned joint venture with a washington dc based developer 
inflation substantially all of the leases at the communities allow  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder  and thus may enable the company to seek increases in rents 
the substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less and the remaining leases are for up to two years 
at the expiration of a lease term  the company s lease agreements generally provide that the term will be extended unless either the company or the lessee gives at least sixty days written notice of termination

funds from operations the company uses the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of funds from operations ffo 
ffo is defined by nareit as net income available to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of property  plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with gaap 
ffo is a supplemental non gaap financial measure 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies because not all real estate companies use the same definition 
the company s ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the current nareit definition 
the company also uses ffo as an operating measure 
accounting for real estate assets using historical cost accounting under gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its april white paper on funds from operations since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result  the concept of ffo was created by nareit for the reit industry to provide an alternate measure 
since the company agrees with the concept of ffo and appreciates the reasons surrounding its creation  management believes that ffo is an important supplemental measure of operating performance 
in addition  since most equity reits provide ffo information to the investment community  the company believes ffo is a useful supplemental measure for comparing the company s results to those of other equity reits 
the company believes that the line on the company s consolidated statement of operations entitled net income available to common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income available to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance 
while management believes that ffo is an important supplemental non gaap financial measure  management believes it is also important to stress that ffo should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity 
further  ffo is not necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs or ability to service indebtedness or make distributions
