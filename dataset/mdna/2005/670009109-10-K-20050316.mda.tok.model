item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following section addresses aspects of noven s financial condition and results of operations 
the contents of this section include an overview of noven and our novogyne joint venture  a review of certain items that affect the historical or future comparability of our results of operations  an analysis of our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources  a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and the application of our critical accounting policies  an outlook that includes our current financial guidance for  and a review of cautionary factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with noven and novogyne s financial statements and the related notes included in this form k 
overview we develop and manufacture advanced transdermal patches and presently derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of transdermal patches for use in menopausal hormone therapy 
in the united states  our ht products are marketed and sold by novogyne pharmaceuticals  the joint venture that we formed with novartis in our business  financial position and results of operations currently depend on novogyne and its marketing of our three principal ht products vivelle  vivelle dot and combipatch in the united states 
a discussion of novogyne s results and their impact on our results can be found under the caption results of operations equity in earnings of novogyne 
in all countries other than the united states  canada and japan  we have licensed the marketing rights to these products to novartis pharma  which is an affiliate of novartis 
in most of these markets  vivelle is marketed under the brand name menorest  vivelle dot is marketed under the brand name estradot and combipatch is marketed under the brand name estalis 
we hold a equity interest in novogyne  and novartis holds a equity interest 
under the terms of the joint venture agreements  we manufacture and supply vivelle  vivelle dot and combipatch to novogyne  perform marketing  sales and promotional activities  and receive royalties from novogyne based on novogyne s sales of the et products 
novartis distributes vivelle  vivelle dot and combipatch and provides certain other services to novogyne 
novartis is entitled to an annual million preferred return  which has the effect of reducing our share of novogyne s income in the first quarter of each year 
after the annual preferred return to novartis  our share of novogyne s income increases as product sales increase  subject to a maximum of 
our share of novogyne s income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the income we recognize from novogyne is a non cash item 
any cash we receive from novogyne is in the form of cash distributions declared by novogyne s management committee 
accordingly  the amount of cash that we receive from 
table of contents novogyne in any period may not be the same as the amount of income we recognize from novogyne for that period 
in  and  we received million  million and million in cash distributions from novogyne  which accounted for a substantial portion of our net cash flows provided by operating activities for these periods 
we expect that a significant portion of our earnings and cash flow for the next several years will be generated through our interest in novogyne  but we cannot assure that novogyne will continue to be profitable or make cash distributions 
any failure by novogyne to remain profitable or to continue to make distributions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the market for ht products  including our transdermal ht products  has contracted since the july publication of the whi study that found adverse health risks associated with ht products 
comparing the second quarter of the quarter immediately preceding the publication of initial data from the whi study to the fourth quarter of  total prescriptions dispensed in the ht market in the united states decreased by 
for the same period  aggregate prescriptions for noven s united states ht products decreased 
the estrogen segment of the ht market in the united states declined  while our vivelle line of products decreased 
vivelle dot  which represented of our total united states prescriptions in the fourth quarter of  increased from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter of we believe vivelle dot patch prescriptions have benefited from patient conversions from the original vivelle product 
united states prescriptions for our combipatch product which represented approximately of our total united states prescriptions in the fourth quarter of declined from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter of  while prescriptions for the total united states market for fixed combination hormone therapy decreased 
the combination therapy arm of whi involved an oral combination estrogen progestin product and  accordingly  the combination therapy segment of the ht market has experienced the most significant decrease 
further decreases for our combipatch product whether as a result of the whi studies  the production issues discussed below or otherwise could require novogyne which holds the combipatch marketing rights to record an impairment loss related to these marketing rights  which would adversely affect the results of operations of both noven and novogyne 
see critical accounting policies investment in novogyne 
certain items that affect historical or future comparability production issues we maintain in house product stability testing for our commercialized products 
this process includes  among other things  testing samples from commercial lots under a variety of conditions to confirm that the samples remain within required specifications for the shelf life of the product 
in  our product stability testing program revealed that certain lots of combipatch and vivelle dot patches did not maintain required specifications throughout the products shelf lives  resulting in product recalls of certain lots 
as a result  in  noven and novogyne established allowances for the return of recalled product  which had the effect of reducing noven s and novogyne s net revenues by million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  based on a review of available relevant information  including actual product returns and future expected returns  noven and novogyne reduced these allowances during the year 
table of contents ended december   which had the effect of increasing net revenues for the year ended december  by million and million for noven and novogyne  respectively 
the effect on noven of these adjustments by noven and novogyne was to increase noven s income before income taxes by million for the year ended december  the effect on novogyne of novogyne s adjustment was to increase novogyne s income before income taxes by million for the year ended december  at december   noven s allowances for recall related returns and reserves for expected costs related to the product recalls were immaterial 
there are no remaining allowances at novogyne related to the recall 
as a result of the recall of vivelle dot patches  noven initiated a series of special stability protocols to monitor commercial lots in distribution as well as future production of vivelle dot 
in the first quarter of  a total of ten lots of vivelle dot manufactured in were identified for recall when one of our stability protocols revealed that these lots did not meet required specification or were associated with lots that did not meet specification 
because these lots were manufactured in  we estimate that an immaterial number of patches from these lots currently remain in distribution 
marketing  general and administrative expense in includes an allowance of million for estimated costs related to these recalls 
based on testing and analysis to date  noven believes that the probable cause of the recent vivelle dot stability failures remains related to the same problematic patch backing material that led to the recall 
noven and novartis have established a joint task force to identify the definitive root cause of the vivelle dot stability failures 
if the root cause determination or additional testing including noven s routine stability testing indicates that the production issue affects more product than noven s current testing and analysis suggests  additional recalls may be required 
the final field alert for the recall of the additional lots of vivelle dot was submitted to the fda on march   and we cannot predict what action  if any  the fda may take as a result of the recalls of vivelle dot 
although noven and novartis are working together in assessing the vivelle dot production issues  novartis  as the holder of the vivelle dot regulatory application  possesses the sole authority to initiate a recall and novartis decision is not within our control 
among others risks  the recent  or any additional  recalls of vivelle dot could result in a decision to recall all or a significant portion of the product in distribution until a definitive root cause has been identified and any required corrective action has been completed  cease production or shipment of new product until a definitive root cause has been identified and any required corrective action has been completed  or reduce the shelf life of vivelle dot 
vivelle dot represented over percent of the total prescriptions written for noven s products in the fourth quarter of and noven s and novogyne s results of operations and prospects would be materially and adversely affected in the event these or similar actions were to occur 
as previously disclosed  in late october  our product stability testing program indicated that one commercial lot of combipatch product did not maintain required specifications throughout the product s shelf life due to the formation of crystals 
this issue is unrelated to the issue that led to the combipatch recall referenced above 
novartis has recalled the affected lot 
the recall of this lot did not have a material impact on noven s and novogyne s financial statements for the year ended december  we continue to manufacture and ship combipatch to novogyne 
we continue to maintain our stability testing for combipatch  and are undertaking additional testing related to the october stability failure 
if our testing indicates that additional combipatch lots do not meet specifications or are affected by the issue impacting the lot recalled  there could be additional recalls 
although noven and novartis work together in assessing production issues  the decision to recall product resides with novartis as the holder of the combipatch regulatory application and is not 
table of contents within our control 
if our estimates concerning product returns associated with the recall are incorrect  or if our continued testing indicates that more than one lot is affected  or if novartis should initiate additional recalls for any reason  then noven s and novogyne s business and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
the recent recalls may result in an fda inspection of our facilities and procedures and we cannot assure that the fda will be satisfied with our operations and procedures  which could result in more frequent and stringent inspections and monitoring 
if the fda were to conclude that our manufacturing controls and procedures are not sufficient  we could be required to suspend production until we demonstrate to the fda that our controls and procedures are sufficient 
shire we are developing a transdermal methylphenidate patch for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
global rights to the developmental product were licensed to shire in the first quarter of for payments up to million  including million paid at closing of the license transaction 
in april  we received a not approvable letter from the fda relating to our new drug application nda for our methylphenidate patch 
beginning in the third quarter of  we ceased amortization of the unamortized balance of license revenue received in the shire transaction due to the planned initiation of an additional clinical trial and the significant costs expected to be incurred in pursuing approval of our methylphenidate patch 
in may  noven and shire met with the fda to review noven s and shire s jointly prepared development plan intended to address issues raised in the not approvable letter 
based on feedback resulting from the meeting  noven and shire are proceeding with the development of our methylphenidate patch 
development efforts include additional clinical studies  including another phase iii study 
pursuant to the agreements between the parties  shire is managing these studies and noven has committed to fund them 
noven s direct costs incurred in pursuit of approval are being deferred and offset against a portion of the million deferred revenue previously received from shire 
such expenses did not impact noven s research and development expenses in and are not expected to impact research and development expenses in  although the direct expenses incurred in pursuit of fda approval will reduce noven s cash position and will have the effect of reducing the amount of deferred revenues that noven may recognize in future periods 
as of december   the amount of deferred revenues was million which excludes the million of deferred revenues related to shire s repurchase right and noven does not expect its prospective cost in pursuit of approval to exceed this amount 
if the additional studies are successful and completed on schedule  the parties would intend to file an amendment to the pending nda during the amendment is expected to receive a six month review by the fda  and there is no assurance that the data to be obtained from the additional studies will address the fda s issues or that the fda may not raise additional issues following any submission of an amendment to the nda for our methylphenidate patch 

table of contents results of operations revenues total revenues are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands change change product revenues novogyne product sales royalties product revenues third parties product sales royalties total product revenues contract and license revenues contract license net revenues net revenues as described in more detail below  the increase in revenues as compared to was primarily attributable to higher contract revenue due to the attainment of certain product development milestones and an increase of product sales in the united states to novogyne 
in addition  net revenues for the period also benefited from a reduction in allowances for returns 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in sales of our international products 
as described in more detail below  the decline in revenues as compared to was primarily attributable to lower unit sales for both our us and international products  as well as approximately million in allowances for returns related to product recalls 
product revenues novogyne product revenues novogyne consists of our sales of vivelle  vivelle dot and combipatch to novogyne at a fixed price for resale primarily in the united states as well as the royalties we receive as a result of novogyne s sales of vivelle and vivelle dot 
for additional information on the components of product revenues novogyne as well as our other sources of revenues  see critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
the million increase in revenues from novogyne for as compared to primarily relates to million in higher sales of vivelle dot 
the increase in vivelle dot sales was primarily due to inventory reduction initiatives in the first half of intended to align inventories with post whi demand  which reduced our sales to novogyne during the period 
in addition  product revenues in included a million allowance for returns related to product 
table of contents recalls 
based upon our review and analysis of historical and expected future returns  we reduced this allowance by million in the net effect of these two events accounts for million of the increase in net revenues for as compared to these increases are offset by a million decrease in combipatch product revenues  which reflect the continuing decline in prescription trends following the publication of the combination therapy arm of the whi study and other studies 
price was not a factor contributing to the overall increase 
the decline in revenues from novogyne for as compared to relates to volume declines of product sold to novogyne  which reflect lower prescription trends following the publication of the whi and other ht studies and the impact of inventory reduction initiatives in intended to align inventories with post whi demand 
a million allowance for returns related to product recalls established in also contributed to the decline 
price was not a factor contributing to this decline 
product revenues third parties product revenues third parties consists primarily of sales of menorest  estradot and estalis to novartis pharma at a price based on a percentage of the licensee s net selling price subject to certain minima for resale primarily outside the united states and japan  together with royalties generated from novartis pharma s sales of vivelle and estradot in canada 
the million decline in product revenues from third parties for as compared to primarily related to million in lower unit sales of all products other than estradot 
the decline in sales reflected lower prescription trends following the publication of the combination therapy arm of the whi study and other studies 
in addition  novartis pharma has indicated that it has reduced orders for menorest in certain countries in anticipation of planned transitions to estradot 
these declines were partially offset by million in higher sales of estradot and an increase of million in royalties generated from novartis pharma s sales of vivelle and estradot in canada 
the higher sales of estradot is related to an increase of million in price adjustment payments in  which were recorded upon determining that novartis pharma s sales price of estradot entitled noven to receive amounts in excess of the minimum transfer price 
the remaining increase in estradot is mostly attributable to higher unit sales 
revenues from third parties declined million for as compared to  of which million related to volume declines of all products for the reasons discussed above and million related to price declines  primarily of estalis 
contract and license revenues contract revenues consists of the recognition of payments received as work is performed on research and development projects 
the payments received may take the form of non refundable up front payments  payments received upon the completion of certain phases of work and success milestone payments 
license revenues consist of the recognition of up front  milestone and similar payments under license agreements 
the increase in contract revenues for as compared to is primarily attributable to million earned in in connection with our p g pharmaceuticals collaboration 
of the million  million was earned in the fourth quarter of and related to the attainment of a product development milestone as determined by p g 
license revenues were consistent in 
table of contents and  which reflects a decrease due to the recognition of license revenues in connection with the shire transaction in  which was not repeated in the current year 
beginning in the third quarter of  we ceased amortization of the deferred balance of license revenues received in the shire transaction due to the planned initiation of an additional clinical trial and the significant costs expected to be incurred in seeking approval of our methylphenidate patch 
in the fourth quarter of  we began to defer and offset our direct costs incurred in pursuit of approval which totaled million in against a portion of the million deferred revenue previously received from shire 
the decrease in license revenues recognized from the shire transaction during was partially offset by license revenue recognized in in connection with our endo collaboration 
the increase in contract revenues for as compared to is primarily attributable to the attainment of certain product development milestones and the completion of certain product development contracts in the increase in license revenues for as compared to is due to the recognition of license revenues in connection with the shire transaction 
as noted above  we ceased amortization of the deferred balance of license revenues received in the shire transaction at the beginning of the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we began to defer and offset against the deferred revenue balance our direct expenses incurred in seeking regulatory approval for our methylphenidate patch including the costs of any clinical studies  which totaled million in gross margin gross margin is summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands change change total product revenues cost of products sold gross profit product revenues less cost of products sold gross margin gross profit as a percentage of product revenues changes in deferred profit on sales of product to novogyne gross margin excluding impact of deferred profit noven s cost of products sold is affected by deferred profits on noven s sale of products to novogyne 
as a result of our equity investment in novogyne  we are required to defer of our profit on product that we sell to novogyne until that product is sold by novogyne to trade customers 
since our cost of products sold is adjusted to reflect changes in deferred profit  our gross margin can vary from period to period based on the timing of our shipments to novogyne and novogyne s sale of our products to trade customers 
if novogyne sells more product than we provide it in a given period ie  if novogyne s inventories decline  we will defer less profit from novogyne 
the amount of deferred profit has fluctuated significantly in the past three years  particularly in when novogyne reduced its inventory of our ht products after the publication of the whi studies 
in light of the significant historic fluctuations in our deferred profit on sales of 
table of contents product to novogyne  we have included our gross margin net of the changes in deferred profit on sales of product to novogyne  which  noven s management believes for the reasons described above  is more meaningful and useful to an understanding of noven s gross margin 
the increase in gross margin excluding the impact of deferred profit in as compared to was primarily related to the million net effect of reductions in of allowances for returns established in the prior year related to product recalls  an increase of million in price adjustment payments received in and a million increase in product royalties 
all of these items increased product revenues without affecting cost of products sold 
these factors causing gross margin to increase were partially offset by lower overhead absorption due to a decline in product sales coupled with an increase in overall overhead costs to accommodate expansion for future products 
the decline in gross margin excluding the impact of deferred profit in as compared to was related to lower overhead absorption due to a million decline in product sales coupled with slightly higher overhead costs 
an unfavorable geographic mix also contributed to the decline 
product sales to novogyne declined million  while product sales to third parties declined million 
the majority of product sales to novogyne are comprised of united states product  which have a higher gross margin than foreign product  which makes up the majority of product sales to third parties 
gross margin excluding the impact of deferred profit in was also adversely affected by allowances for returns established in related to product recalls  which decreased product revenues without affecting cost of goods sold 
these factors that caused gross margin to decline were partially offset by a million increase in royalties 
including deferred profit on sales of product to novogyne in the calculation of gross margin would increase gross margin by and in and and would decrease gross margin by in operating expenses operating expenses are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands change change research and development marketing  general and administrative research and development the million increase for as compared to was primarily attributable to a million increase in non clinical development expenses related to our fentanyl transdermal system and a million increase in development expenses for ht products 
in addition  there was a million increase in personnel costs related to increased regulatory and clinical development activities for fentanyl and other developmental products 
this increase was partially offset by a million reduction in development and clinical expenses related to our methylphenidate patch 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  our direct costs incurred in pursuit of approval of our methylphenidate patch are being deferred and offset against a portion of the million deferred revenue previously received from shire 
accordingly  those expenses are not reflected in our reported research and development expenses 

table of contents the million decline for as compared to was primarily attributable to million lower expenses for our methylphenidate patch due to the completion of a phase iii clinical trial in marketing  general and administrative expenses the million increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to a million increase in compensation and employee benefit costs attributable to expansion for anticipated new product launches and a million increase in consulting  professional  legal  accounting and audit fees  a substantial portion of which relates to new internal control requirements resulting from the sarbanes oxley act and other regulatory requirements 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction of million in pre launch marketing expenses for our methylphenidate patch  which ceased in early as a result of the license of this product to shire  as well as a million reduction in recall related expenses 
the million increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to million in costs associated with product recalls  a million increase in insurance costs  a million increase in legal fees  primarily related to the shire transaction  and a million increase in consulting  professional  accounting and audit fees primarily related to new internal control requirements resulting from the sarbanes oxley act and other regulatory requirements 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction of million in pre launch marketing expenses for our methylphenidate patch  which ceased in early as a result of the shire transaction 
other income and expenses income taxes our effective tax rate was for and for and the provision for income taxes is based on the federal statutory and state income tax rates 
the decrease in our effective tax rate for as compared to the prior year relates primarily to a reduction in accruals for outstanding internal revenue service audits 
from time to time  we are subject to audits by taxing authorities covering a wide range of matters  and the internal revenue service is currently auditing our federal income tax returns for certain open years 
such matters are subject to various uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us 
since  we have established accruals for pending matters that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable 
in the fourth quarter  the provision for income taxes benefited from a million reduction in these accruals for ongoing tax audits due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters 
as of december   we had million in accruals related to these matters 
management believes that any liability that may ultimately result from the resolution of pending matters in excess of the amount accrued will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
net deferred income tax assets are measured using the average graduated tax rate for the estimated amount of annual taxable income in the years that the liability is expected to be settled or the asset recovered 
the effect of adjusting the expected tax rate related to the net deferred income tax assets is included in the provision for income taxes 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million 
realization of this deferred tax asset depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is 
table of contents more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will be realized based upon estimated future taxable income 
equity in earnings of novogyne we share in the earnings of novogyne  after satisfaction of an annual preferred return of million to novartis  according to an established formula 
novogyne produced sufficient income in each of  and for us to recognize earnings from novogyne under the formula 
we report our share of novogyne s earnings as equity in earnings of novogyne on our statements of operations 
the financial results of novogyne are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands change change gross revenues sales allowances sales returns allowances sales and returns allowances net revenues cost of sales gross profit gross margin percentage selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangible asset income from operations interest income net income noven s equity in earnings of novogyne novogyne revenues novogyne s gross revenues increased million for as compared to  primarily due to million in increased sales of vivelle dot and million in increased sales of estradot to canada  partially offset by a million decrease in volume sales of vivelle  our first generation estrogen patch  and a million decrease in volume sales of combipatch 
we believe the increase in estradot sales to canada was due to novartis pharma stocking inventory as they transitioned from vivelle  our first generation product  to estradot  our second generation product 
approximately million of the vivelle dot increase was due to price increases  while the remaining million increase related to increased unit sales based on increased prescription trends 
the decline in volume sales of vivelle for as compared to is primarily attributable to vivelle being in a declining trend due to product maturity 
the lower volume sales of combipatch 
table of contents in were due to a continuing decline in the market for combination therapies after the publication of the combination therapy arm of the whi study 
novogyne s gross revenues declined million for as compared to  as a result of a million decrease in volume sales of vivelle and combipatch  partially offset by increased volume sales and price for vivelle dot 
the decline in volume sales of vivelle and combipatch in as compared to was attributable to the same factors described above for compared to inventory reduction initiatives did not have a material impact on results for as compared to sales allowances consist of chargebacks  medicaid rebates  managed healthcare rebates  cash discounts and other allowances  which tend to fluctuate based on changes in gross revenues 
these sales allowances were  and of gross revenues for the year ended december   and  respectively 
sales returns allowances consist of i changes in allowances for returns of expiring product  and ii changes in allowances for returns for product recalls 
the activity for sales returns allowances for the fiscal years ended december   and was as follows changes in allowances for returns of expiring product changes in allowances for returns for product recalls sales returns allowances actual returns for expiring product actual returns for product recalls actual returns during the year ended balance of sales returns allowances at december  the increase in allowances for returns of expiring product for as compared to is primarily related to higher expected returns as a result of increased sales of vivelle dot as well as higher actual returns of vivelle 
the reduction in allowances for returns for product recalls in is based on a review of available relevant information  including actual product returns and future expected returns for the combipatch and vivelle dot recalls 
the decline in allowances for returns of expiring product for as compared to is primarily attributable to increases in allowances for returns of expiring product in as a result of the publication of the whi study and higher actual product returns in in  product sales and actual returns of expired product declined  resulting in substantially lower allowances for returns of expiring product 
the allowances for returns for product recalls in were related to the combipatch and vivelle dot recalls during that year 
novogyne gross margin gross margin percentage was stable for as compared to the increase in gross margin for as compared to was primarily due to lower sales allowances and returns for 
table of contents expiring product  which increased net revenues without affecting cost of sales  and lower inventory obsolescence reserves 
novogyne selling  general and administrative novogyne s selling  general and administrative expenses increased for as compared to  due to increased sales force costs  higher advertising and promotion expenses  million higher products liability insurance and million in ht litigation reserves established in the fourth quarter of  which are partially offset by a million estimated insurance recovery 
these increases were partially offset by decreased administrative expenses as a result of implementing a new sales force automation system and reduced sample expenses which was primarily attributable to timing of sample orders by novogyne 
novogyne s selling  general and administrative expenses declined for as compared to  due to lower advertising and promotion expenses  primarily related to combipatch  and expense reductions associated with the co promotion of novartis famvir product 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  and  we had million and million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital current assets less current liabilities of million and million  respectively 
cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities is summarized as follows amounts in thousands cash flows operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in primarily resulted from the receipt of an million license payment upon the closing of the endo transaction in february and million in distributions from novogyne 
the increase was partially offset by changes in working capital due to the timing of payments and receipts  specifically for payment of income taxes  expenses incurred in pursuit of regulatory approval for our methylphenidate patch  purchases of inventory for our fentanyl product  and amounts due from novogyne 
net cash provided by operating activities in primarily resulted from the receipt of a million license payment upon the closing of the shire transaction in april and million in distributions from novogyne 
the increase was partially offset by changes in working capital due to the timing and amount of product shipments  payment of director s and officer s insurance premiums and payment of income taxes 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities in primarily resulted from an million distribution from novogyne 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in  and was primarily attributable to the purchase of fixed assets to expand production capacity for future products and payment of patent development costs 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in was attributable to million received in connection with the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities for was primarily attributable to cash received in connection with the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by the repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in was attributable to cash received in connection with the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by payments made on capital leases 
short term and long term liquidity our principal sources of short term liquidity are existing cash  cash generated from product sales  fees and royalties under development and license agreements and distributions from novogyne 
for the year ended december   substantially all of our income before income taxes was comprised of equity in earnings of novogyne  a non cash item 
accordingly  our net income may not be reflective of our short term liquidity 
although we expect to receive distributions from novogyne  there can be no assurance that novogyne will have sufficient profits or cash flow to pay distributions or that novogyne s management committee will authorize such distributions 
our short term cash flow is dependent on sales  royalties and license fees associated with transdermal ht products 
any decrease in sales of those products by us or our licensees or any increase in returns of products to novogyne including any such changes resulting from the ht studies  the further decline of the ht market  or the inability or failure of novogyne to pay distributions would have a material adverse effect on our short term liquidity and require us to rely on our existing cash balances or on borrowings to support our operations and business 
we also expect our funding of additional studies for our methylphenidate patch will have a negative impact on our short term liquidity 
for the year ended december   million in deferred license revenues were used to offset development expenses related to our methylphenidate patch  of which million remained payable to shire as of december  in early  we received invoices for approximately million of this amount 
we expect to pay shire the full million in the first half of we cannot assure that our methylphenidate patch will be approved by the fda  particularly in light of the not approvable letter we received from the fda in april  and there is no assurance that the additional studies will address the fda s issues or that the fda may not raise additional issues following any submission of an amendment to our methylphenidate patch nda 
additionally  even if the fda approves our methylphenidate patch  
table of contents we cannot assure that shire will generate sales at levels that would trigger our milestone payments  therefore  we cannot assure that we will receive any further payments from shire with respect to our methylphenidate patch or that we will be able to recover those expenses through sales of the product 
as of december   we have incurred million for the cost of pre launch inventories for our fentanyl patch 
if approval is not ultimately received or is delayed  our agreement with endo provides that the parties will share the cost of manufacturing product that cannot be sold by endo in accordance with an agreed upon formula and we may be unable to recover our share of such costs  which could be up to approximately million 
if the product has not been approved by july  endo may have the right to terminate the license  depending on the number of generic competitors in the market 
capital expenditures were million in  primarily to fund plant and equipment purchases for the manufacture of our fentanyl patch 
we expect that our capital expenditures will increase significantly in as we continue to expand our manufacturing and storage facilities for products under development  including those under development with shire  p g pharmaceuticals and others 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures from our existing cash balances 
as a general matter  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our operating needs and anticipated short term capital requirements 
in february  we entered into an industrial long term lease the lease for approximately  square feet of newly constructed space located in close proximity to our manufacturing facility in miami  florida 
we intend to use the leased space for the storage and  as needed  the manufacture of new product 
the lease term is years  which may be extended for up to an additional years pursuant to four renewal options of five years each and a one time option to renew for one year 
the annual base rent is per square foot 
we also pay a monthly management fee equal to percent of the base rent 
the rent for the first year is discounted to per square foot 
the base rent is subject to annual increases of three percent during the initial year term 
after the initial term  the rent will be percent of the fair market rate of the leased space as determined under the lease 
the landlord will reimburse us up to  for leasehold improvements 
for accounting purposes  we expect to amortize the aggregate expected rental payments on a straight line basis over the initial year term of the lease 
the renewal terms have not been included for amortization purposes because we cannot reasonably estimate the rental payments after the initial term and we cannot assure that we will renew the lease after the initial term 
any leasehold improvements will be recorded at cost and will be amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the initial year lease term 
reimbursements of leasehold improvements by the landlord will be recorded as a deferred rent credit and will be amortized on a straight line basis over the initial year lease term as a reduction of rent expense 
for our long term operating needs  we intend to utilize funds derived from the above sources  as well as funds generated through sales of products under development or products that we may license or acquire from others 
we expect that such funds will be comprised of payments received pursuant to future development and licensing arrangements  as well as direct sales of our own products 
we expect that our cash requirements will continue to increase  primarily to fund plant and equipment purchases to expand production capacity for new products 
if our products under development  including those being developed with shire  p g pharmaceuticals and others  are 
table of contents successful  these expenditures  which may include an additional manufacturing plant  are expected to be significant 
we cannot assure that we will successfully complete the development of such products  that we will obtain regulatory approval for any such products  that any approved product may be produced in commercial quantities  at reasonable costs  and be successfully marketed  or that we will successfully negotiate future licensing or product acquisition arrangements 
because much of the cost associated with product development and expansion of manufacturing facilities is incurred prior to product launch  if we are unsuccessful in out licensing  or if we are unable to launch additional commercially viable products that we develop or that we license or acquire from others  we will have incurred the up front costs associated with product development or acquisition without the benefit of the liquidity generated by sales of those products  which could adversely affect our long term liquidity needs 
factors that could impact our ability to develop or acquire and launch additional commercially viable products are discussed under factors affecting our business and prospects 
to the extent that capital requirements exceed available capital  we will seek alternative sources of financing to fund our operations 
no assurance can be given that alternative financing will be available  if at all  in a timely manner  or on favorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain satisfactory alternative financing  we may be required to delay or reduce our proposed expenditures  including expenditures for research and development and plant and equipment  in order to meet our future cash requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements

the amounts that may be paid by noven to fund the clinical trials for our methylphenidate patch are not included in the foregoing table because total costs cannot be determined at this time

new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities which have one or both of the following characteristics i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity  and ii the equity investors lack one or more of the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
we have applied this statement for our calendar year beginning january  our investment in novogyne is not considered a variable interest in a variable interest entity vie under the provisions of fin therefore  the consolidation and disclosure rules of fin are not applicable to us and the adoption of this interpretation has had no impact on our financial statements 
these conclusions are based on currently available information and require us to assess our investment interest and ownership rights in novogyne 
if our conclusions or our underlying assumptions of factual information concerning our investment in novogyne were to change  novogyne may be considered a vie and our investment in novogyne could become subject to the consolidation and disclosure rules of fin in that case  a determination would have to be made as to the primary beneficiary of novogyne s interest 
the primary beneficiary would then consolidate novogyne 
we believe that even if a determination were made that novogyne was a vie at december   novartis is the primary beneficiary due to its preferred return and equity interest in novogyne and would continue to consolidate novogyne 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  or wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the so abnormal criterion outlined in accounting research bulletin  chapter  inventory pricing 
sfas also introduces the concept of normal capacity and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overheads must be recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently assessing sfas and we are unable to currently estimate the impact it will have on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
r share based payment revised sfas r that will require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award  which is generally over the vesting period 
sfas r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
for public companies such as noven  the statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we anticipate applying this statement for our third quarter beginning july   which we expect will result in compensation expenses of approximately million not including tax effects for the second half of  based on option grants outstanding at december  the foregoing amount does not include compensation expense for any stock options that may be granted after january  see critical accounting estimates fair value of stock options for a discussion on fair value option valuation models and assumptions used in making this estimate 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the fair value of employee stock options  the determination of the net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset  estimates related to allowance for returns related to product recalls  accrued liabilities  income and other tax accruals  revenue recognition and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
many of our critical accounting estimates are those which we believe require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain or which involve factors that may be beyond our control 
using different assumptions could result in materially different results 
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows revenue recognition substantially all of our product revenues were derived from sales to our licensees  novogyne  novartis pharma and its affiliates and aventis pharma ag 
certain of our license agreements provide that the ultimate supply price is based on a percentage of the licensee s net selling price 
each of those agreements also establishes a fixed minimum supply price per unit that represents the lowest price we are entitled to receive on sales to the licensee 
we receive the minimum price at the time of shipment with the possibility of an upward adjustment later when the licensee s net selling price is known 
revenues under these agreements are recorded at the minimum price at the time of shipment 
we record any upward adjustments to revenues at the time that the information necessary 
table of contents to make the determination is received from the licensee 
if the upward adjustments are not determinable  we record the adjustments on a cash basis ie when received 
these amounts are included in product revenues 
if our licensee s determination that upward adjustments to revenues prove to be incorrect or inaccurate our results of operations and financial position may be materially impacted 
we enter into certain contracts that have various terms and conditions that may have multiple revenue characteristics  including license revenues  contract revenues  product sales and manufacturing revenues 
as prescribed by eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we analyze each contract in order to separate each deliverable into separate units of accounting and then recognize revenues for those separated units at their fair value as earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition topic 
if each deliverable does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  the deliverables are combined and the amounts under the contract are allocated to the combined deliverables 
the appropriate recognition of revenue is then determined for the combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting 
the analysis prescribed by eitf requires us to make a number of significant assumptions and judgments  including those related to sales price  unit costs and manufacturing profit expected launch date of the product licensed and valuation of that licensed product  and price  cost  and applicable profit of research and development work to be performed 
changes in any of these assumptions and judgments could lead to a different conclusion on what the separate units of accounting are and their applicable fair values  which may lead to material changes to revenue recognition 
license revenues consist of up front  milestone and similar payments under license agreements and are not recognized until earned under the terms of the applicable agreements 
in most cases  license revenues are deferred and recognized over the estimated product life cycle or the length of relevant patents  whichever is shorter 
estimates of product life cycles are inherently uncertain including as a result of regulatory  competitive or medical developments 
we estimate product life cycles based on our assessment of various factors  including the expected launch date of the product licensed  the strength of the intellectual property protection of the product  and various other competitive  developmental and regulatory issues  and contractual terms 
any change to the actual or estimated product life could require us to change the recognition period 
contract revenues consist of contract payments related to research and development projects performed for third parties 
the work performed by us includes feasibility studies to determine if a specific drug is amenable to transdermal drug delivery  the actual formulation of a specific drug into a transdermal drug delivery system  studies to address the ongoing stability of the drug in a transdermal drug delivery system and manufacturing of batches of product that can be used in human clinical trials 
we receive contract payments for the work we perform in the following forms nonrefundable up front payments prior to commencing the work or certain phases of the work  additional payments upon completion of additional phases  and in some cases  success milestone payments based on achievement of specified performance criteria 
for non refundable up front payments received prior to commencing work  we recognize revenue based on the proportionate share of the work performed by us in any given period based on the total hours we expect to incur on the project to deliver all our obligations under the contract 

table of contents there are a number of assumptions  estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the total hours we expect to incur on the project  including personnel and time involved 
similar assumptions  estimates and judgments are involved in determining the proportionate share of the work performed by us in any given period in addition to estimates of hours remaining to complete the project 
any changes in these assumptions  estimates and judgments may cause us to materially change revenue recognition 
additional payments upon completion of additional phases and milestone payments are recorded when the specified performance criteria are achieved  as determined by the customer 
each contract may have different payment terms and each customer may vary in its determination that specified performance criteria are achieved 
therefore  the timing of revenue recognition may vary from contract to contract 
revenues are net of an allowance for returns 
we establish allowances for returns for product that has been recalled or that we believe is probable of being recalled 
the methodology used by us to estimate product recall returns is based on the distribution and expiration dates of the affected product and overall trade inventory levels 
these estimates are based on currently available information  and the ultimate outcome may be significantly different than the amounts estimated given the subjective nature of the assumptions and complexities inherent in this area and in the pharmaceutical industry 
for example  during novartis initiated recalls of certain lots of combipatch and vivelle dot due to production issues 
our revenues for are net of approximately million and million in allowances for returns at noven and novogyne  respectively 
based on a review of available information  including actual product returns and future expected returns  noven and novogyne reduced these allowances during  which had the effect of increasing net revenues for by million and million for noven and novogyne  respectively 
the effect on noven of these adjustments by noven and novogyne was to increase noven s income before income taxes by million for the effect on novogyne of novogyne s adjustment was to increase novogyne s income before income taxes by million for if our estimate concerning the amount of the product returns is incorrect or if novartis should initiate further unexpected recalls  then our results of operations could be materially different 
fair value of stock options we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options as allowed pursuant to sfas  as amended by sfas accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for the years ended december   and as noted in the section new accounting standards  in december  the fasb issued sfas r that will require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
had compensation cost for our stock option plans been determined on the basis of fair value at the grant date for awards under those plans  consistent with this statement and using our existing valuation method for our employee stock options  the black scholes option pricing model  we estimate that our net income for the years ended december   and would have been reduced by  and  respectively 
furthermore  as stated in the section new accounting standards  we anticipate applying this statement for our third quarter beginning july   which we expect would result in compensation expenses of approximately million not including tax effects for the second half of  based on option grants outstanding at december  the foregoing amount does not include compensation 
table of contents expense for any stock options that may be granted after january  however  these calculations use option valuation models that use highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
in addition  the effect of applying the fair value method of accounting for stock options on reported net income for  and may not be representative of the effects for future years because outstanding options vest over a period of several years and additional awards are generally made each year 
inventories inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we use a standard costing system to estimate our fifo cost of inventory at the end of each reporting period 
historically  standard costs have been substantially consistent with actual costs 
we determine the market value of our raw materials  finished product and packaging inventories based upon references to current market prices for such items as of the end of each reporting period and record a write down of inventory standard cost to market  when applicable 
we periodically review our inventory for excess items  and we establish a valuation provision based upon the age of specific items in inventory and the expected recovery from the disposition of the items 
a provision is established for the estimated aged surplus  spoiled or damaged products  and discontinued inventory items and components 
the amount of the provision is determined by analyzing inventory composition  expected usage  historical and projected sales information  and other factors 
changes in sales volume due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could result in materially different amounts for this item 
income taxes accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that we not record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax asset 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax asset will be realized based upon our estimated future income and  accordingly  no valuation allowance for the net deferred income tax asset was deemed necessary 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
from time to time  we are subject to audits by taxing authorities  covering a wide range of matters  and the internal revenue service is currently auditing our federal income tax returns for certain open years 
such matters are subject to various uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us 
we have established accruals for pending matters that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable 
we have made certain assumptions  estimates and judgments when establishing these accruals  including estimates of settlements  interest on settlements  interest rates and applicable interest periods  and penalties 
changes to these assumptions  estimates and judgments could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes 

table of contents investment in novogyne we entered into a joint venture novogyne with novartis  effective may   to market and sell women s prescription healthcare products in the united states and canada 
we account for our investment in novogyne under the equity method and report our share of novogyne s earnings as equity in earnings of novogyne on our statements of operations 
we defer the recognition of of our profit on products sold to novogyne until the products are sold by novogyne 
as of december   novogyne had a long term intangible asset of million related to the acquisition of the marketing rights to combipatch 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that novogyne record this asset at cost and that the asset be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
testing for impairment requires novogyne to estimate the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset and compare that amount to the carrying value of the asset 
if this analysis indicates that a possible impairment exists undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  novogyne would be required to estimate the fair value of the asset 
the determination of fair value of this asset would involve numerous uncertainties because there is no viable actively traded market for the marketing rights of a pharmaceutical product 
as permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  if novogyne would be required to estimate the fair value of the marketing rights  it would utilize a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis values an asset on the basis of the net present value of the cash expected to be generated by that asset over its estimated useful life 
this analysis requires novogyne to make a number of significant assumptions and judgments 
for example  estimates need to be made regarding prescription trends  sales price  unit cost and product life cycle among many other factors including the discount rate to be applied to the estimated cash generated by sales of the product 
a material change in any of these assumptions may require novogyne to record an impairment loss  which would adversely affect novogyne s operating results in the period in which the determination or allowance were made 
this would reduce our earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period and the amount of our investment in novogyne and could  depending on the size of the impairment  result in a loss at both the novogyne and noven level for the period in which the impairment occurred 
neither novogyne nor we are able to predict the effect of the recently discontinued and currently ongoing ht studies  the recalls in and affecting combipatch  or the recent launch of a competitive combination ht patch  on the prospects for the ht market or the market for combipatch 
any adverse change in the market for ht products could have a material adverse impact on the ability of novogyne to recover its investment in combipatch which could require novogyne to record an impairment loss for that asset 
novogyne records sales net of sales allowances for chargebacks  medicaid rebates  managed healthcare rebates  cash discounts  product returns and other allowances 
the returns portion of the sales allowance related to expiration dating is based in part on novartis returned goods policy 
the methodology used by novogyne to estimate product returns is based on i the historical experience of actual product returns and ii the estimated lag time between when an actual sale takes place in relation to when the products are physically returned by a customer 
the historical actual returns rate is then applied to product sales during the estimated lag period to develop the returns estimate 
however  because novogyne s return history includes periods of higher and lower trade inventory levels and varying levels of demand  in making its final estimations of expected product returns  novogyne also considers trends and expectations for future demand and trade inventory levels 
novogyne does not accept returns due to short dating until the product has less than a certain 
table of contents amount of shelf life remaining 
also  novogyne does not accept returns due to expiration later than a certain period after the product has expired 
these policies cause a significant lag time between when a product is sold and the latest date on which a return could occur 
novogyne believes this is a reasonable basis on which to estimate returns exposure and incorporates the key factors that contribute to returns 
in addition  novogyne establishes sales returns allowances for product that has been recalled or that it believes is probable of being recalled 
the methodology used to estimate product returns is based on the distribution and expiration dates of the affected product and overall trade inventory levels 
these estimates are based on currently available information  and the ultimate outcome may be significantly different than the amounts estimated given the subjective nature and complexities inherent in this area and in the pharmaceutical industry 
novartis controls and maintains the reserves associated with such sales allowances and returns on behalf of novogyne and pays all monies owed and issues credits to individual customers as deemed necessary 
the contracts that underlie these transactions are maintained by novartis for its business as a whole and those transactions relating to novogyne are estimated by novartis 
based on an analysis of the underlying activity  the amounts recorded by novogyne represent novartis best estimate of charges that apply to sales by novogyne 
however  neither novogyne nor we can control novartis analysis of the underlying activity or its application of that analysis to novogyne 
if novartis materially changes the assumptions it uses in allocating reserves or in the actual determination of the gross reserve  novogyne may be required to record an additional reserve allowance on its financial statements  which would adversely affect novogyne s operating results during the period in which the determination or reserve were made  and would consequently also reduce the earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period 
in the course of its audit of novogyne s financial statements included in this annual report on form k  novogyne s independent registered public accounting firm identified what it believes is a significant deficiency in novogyne s internal controls which related to oversights by novartis in connection with novogyne s accounting for certain rebate accruals 
these oversights resulted in an immaterial adjustment at novogyne in the fourth quarter of we have been advised that the audit and compliance committee of novartis ag has engaged outside counsel and is conducting an ongoing internal investigation of this matter 
it is not possible for us to predict what impact  if any  novartis internal investigation may have 
to our knowledge  none of the issues that are the subject of the investigation involves noven  noven s accounting policies or practices  or any of noven s officers  directors or employees 
novogyne is required to establish accruals for certain loss contingencies related to litigation 
novogyne accrues estimated legal fees and settlement costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
however  the estimation of the amount to accrue requires significant judgment 
litigation accruals require novogyne to make assumptions about the future outcome of each case based on current information  expected legal fees that will be incurred and any expected insurance recovery 
as of december   novogyne had litigation accruals of million  with an expected insurance recovery of million 
novartis controls and maintains the accruals associated with such litigation on behalf of novogyne and pays all monies owed for legal fees and settlements  as well as collects any insurance recovery 
the litigation accruals and estimated insurance recoveries are maintained by novartis for its business as a whole and those accruals and recoveries relating to novogyne are estimated by novartis 
based on an analysis of the underlying data  the amounts recorded by novogyne represent novartis best estimate of litigation 
table of contents accruals and estimated insurance recoveries relating to novogyne 
however  neither novogyne nor we can control novartis analysis of the underlying data or its application of that analysis to novogyne 
litigation and its outcome are inherently difficult to predict 
if novartis materially changes the assumptions it uses in allocating litigation accruals and any applicable insurance recoveries  or if actual outcomes are different from what has been estimated  novogyne may be required to record additional charges or reduce its accruals  which would affect novogyne s operating results during the period in which the determination  accrual or reduction were made  and would consequently affect the earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period 
the critical accounting estimates discussed herein are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
outlook a summary of our financial guidance is provided below 
this forward looking information is based on our current assumptions and expectations  many of which are beyond our control to achieve 
in particular  for purposes of this guidance we have assumed that during except as otherwise indicated below there will not be any material transactions  changes in noven s or novogyne s accounting or accounting principles  regulatory  technological or clinical study developments  changes in the supply of  demand for  or distribution of our ht products including any changes resulting from product recalls  competitive ht products  or new ht study results  changes in our business relationships collaborations  or changes in the economy or the health care sector generally 
financial guidance is inherently uncertain 
accordingly  we cannot assure that we will achieve results consistent with this guidance 
if our assumptions or expectations concerning any of these matters prove to be incorrect  our actual financial results could differ materially from the expected results discussed below 
for a discussion of certain factors that may impact our actual financial results for the periods referenced  readers should carefully consider the risks  uncertainties and cautionary factors discussed below under the caption factors affecting our business and prospects 
our financial guidance does not reflect the potential impact on noven s results of sfas r  accounting for stock based compensation  which is scheduled to become effective beginning with our third quarter results 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations new accounting standards 
potential fentanyl revenues 
our anda for our generic fentanyl patch is currently pending at the fda  and we are unable to predict when or if it will be approved 
if our anda is approved and the product is launched by endo the licensee of the product in the us and canada  we expect to receive a launch related milestone payment ranging from million to million  which 
table of contents payment will be deferred and recognized as noven license and contract revenues over the remainder of the year period that began on the closing of the endo license transaction in the first quarter of under the terms of our agreement with endo  we will manufacture and supply endo with finished product at our cost and will share in endo s profit generated from us product sales 
at this time  we do not have sufficient information regarding timing of approval  number of competitors  market share  product pricing and other factors necessary to forecast an expected contribution of our fentanyl patch to our financial results 
research and development 
in support of our strategy to expand our product pipeline  we expect to continue to invest in research and development in at levels comparable to in addition  we are working to formulate certain new transdermal products that  if successfully formulated  may enter human studies during these studies  if initiated  would be funded by noven and may cause our research and development expense in to increase substantially over levels 
marketing  general and administrative expense 
we expect noven s marketing  general and administrative expense in to increase over levels  with anticipated increases in costs associated with facility expansion  professional services fees and other areas 
capital expenditures 
we expect that our capital expenditures will increase significantly in as we continue to expand our manufacturing and storage facilities for products under development  including those under development with shire  p g pharmaceuticals and others 
novogyne 
based on our current prescription forecasts  we believe that novogyne s revenues and net income for full year should approximate results 
factors affecting our business and prospects the following section summarizes certain risk factors that may cause our results to differ from the forward looking statements made in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of noven 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not listed in order of priority and are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operation 
we do not undertake to update any of these forward looking statements or to announce the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements except as required by law 
additional ht studies may cause the market for our ht products to further decline 
the market for ht products has been negatively affected by the whi study and other studies that have found that the overall health risks from the use of certain ht products exceed the benefits from the use of those products among healthy postmenopausal women 
for example  total prescriptions dispensed in the ht market in the united states declined by from the second quarter of the quarter immediately preceding the whi study to the fourth quarter of the market for ht products  including ours  both in the united states and abroad  could be further adversely impacted if additional or follow up ht studies find unacceptable risks from ht use 
currently  our liquidity  results of operations and business prospects are almost entirely dependent on sales  license royalties and fees associated with transdermal ht products 
accordingly  any further adverse change in the market for ht products could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial position and results of operations 

table of contents our failure to develop  license or acquire new products and commercialize them on a timely basis could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations and could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our long term strategy is dependent upon the successful development of new products and their successful commercialization 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify commercially promising products or technologies or additional indications to which our products and technologies may be beneficially applied 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and obtain marketing approval from regulatory authorities may be considerable 
no assurance can be given that we will have the financial resources necessary to complete products under development  that those projects to which we dedicate resources will be successfully completed  that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for any such product  or that any approved product can be produced in commercial quantities  at reasonable costs  and be successfully marketed  either by us or by a licensing partner 
a project can fail or be delayed at any stage of development  even if each prior stage was completed successfully  which could jeopardize our ability to recover our investment in the product 
some of our development projects will not be completed successfully or on schedule 
many of the factors which may cause a product in development to fail or be delayed  such as difficulty in enrolling patients in clinical trials  the failure of clinical trials  lack of sufficient supplies or raw materials  inability to supply the subject product or technology on a commercial scale on an economical basis and changes in regulations  are beyond our control 
from time to time we may need to acquire licenses to patents and other intellectual property of third parties to develop  manufacture and commercialize our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire such licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
the failure to obtain such a license could negatively affect our ability to develop  manufacture and commercialize certain products 
in some cases  we have begun and  in the future  may begin development of a product that we do not intend to independently develop through clinical trials and market  with the expectation that a licensee will be identified to assist in development and or marketing 
there can be no assurance that we will attract a business partner for any particular product or will be able to negotiate an agreement on commercially reasonable terms 
if an agreement is not reached  our initial development investment in any such product may not be recovered 
we depend on partners to obtain regulatory approval for  and to market and sell  certain of our products 
our marketing partners sell products that compete with our products 
we depend upon collaborative agreements with other pharmaceutical companies to obtain regulatory approval for and to market and sell certain of our products 
to help alleviate the up front financial burden of seeking product approval and commercializing products we often seek out strategic partners to whom we can license our products 
under the terms of the novogyne joint venture  novartis is responsible for the distribution of novogyne s products  including vivelle dot  and for selling novogyne s products to its trade customers 
for our methylphenidate patch  we have granted the exclusive marketing rights to shire and we are working jointly with shire to obtain fda approval of our methylphenidate patch 
for our transdermal fentanyl patch  we have granted the exclusive marketing rights to endo 
failure of novartis and our other marketing partners to market our products successfully would cause the quantity of products purchased from us and the amount of fees and royalties ultimately paid to us to be reduced and would therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
our partners may have different and  sometimes  competing priorities 
some of our partners  including novartis and shire  market and sell products competitive 
table of contents with ours 
shire has a portfolio of adhd products and in early licensed an amphetamine pro drug in phase iii studies for the treatment of adhd 
the marketing organizations of our partners may be unsuccessful  or those partners may assign a lower level of priority to the marketing of our products 
if one or more partners fails to pursue the marketing of our products as planned  or if marketing of any of those products is otherwise delayed  our business  financial position and results of operations may be negatively affected 
absent these marketing partners  we do not presently have a significant direct marketing channel to health care providers for our drug delivery technologies 
we do not control novogyne and we may face additional risks because novartis  our joint venture partner  has significantly greater resources than we do 
our equity in earnings of novogyne contributed substantially all of our income before income taxes in  and novogyne s results will likely continue to be material to us in the future 
because  among other things  we are vastly different in size from novartis  and because novartis and its affiliates sell competing products outside of novogyne  our interests may not always be aligned 
this may result in potential conflicts between novartis and us on matters relating to novogyne which we may not be able to resolve on favorable terms or at all 
under the novogyne joint venture agreement  novartis has the right to dissolve novogyne under certain circumstances 
novogyne s management committee is comprised of a majority of representatives from novartis 
while certain significant corporate actions require the supermajority vote of the committee members  we do not control novogyne 
in addition  the joint venture operating agreement has a buy sell provision that either noven or novartis may trigger by notifying the other party of the price at which the triggering party would be willing to acquire of the joint venture 
novartis is a larger company with greater financial resources  and therefore may be in a better position to be the purchaser if the provision is triggered 
if the provision is triggered and novartis is the purchaser  there can be no assurance that we would be able to reinvest the proceeds of the sale in a manner that would result in sufficient earnings to offset the loss of earnings from novogyne 
if the provision is triggered and we are the purchaser  there can be no assurance that we would not be adversely affected by the changes in capital and or debt structure that likely would be required to finance the purchase transaction 
we depend on novartis to perform all financial  accounting  inventory  sales deductions and other functions for novogyne 
under the novogyne joint venture  novartis is responsible for providing novogyne with all financial  accounting  legal and regulatory services  including monitoring inventory levels and estimating and recording sales allowances and returns for novogyne which include reserves and allowances related to product returns 
as a consequence  we may have limited ability to accurately forecast the amount of such sales allowances in any period 
if novartis materially changes the assumptions it uses in allocating reserves or in the actual determination of the gross reserve  novogyne may be required to record an additional reserve allowance on its financial statements  which would adversely affect novogyne s operating results during the period in which the determination or reserve were made  and would  consequently also reduce our earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period 
failure by novartis to perform its obligations under the joint venture could negatively affect the financial position and results of operations of novogyne and us 
in the course of its audit of novogyne s financial statements included in this annual report on form k  novogyne s independent registered public accounting firm identified what it believes is a significant deficiency in novogyne s internal controls which related to oversights by novartis in connection with novogyne s accounting for certain rebate accruals 
these oversights resulted in an immaterial adjustment at novogyne in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents we have been advised that the audit and compliance committee of novartis ag has engaged outside counsel and is conducting an ongoing internal investigation of this matter 
it is not possible for us to predict what impact  if any  novartis internal investigation may have 
to our knowledge  none of the issues that are the subject of the investigation involves noven  noven s accounting policies or practices  or any of noven s officers  directors or employees 
we may be unable to obtain marketing approval for our new products  including our methylphenidate patch and our fentanyl patch  on a timely basis or at all 
we are not able to market our products including generic drug products in the united states or other jurisdictions without first obtaining marketing approval from the fda or an equivalent foreign agency 
the process of obtaining fda approval for a new product may take several years or more and is likely to involve the expenditures of substantial resources 
the process is subject to the broad authority and discretion of the fda 
as a result of the publicity surrounding the withdrawal of vioxx by merck co  inc in the fourth quarter of and the publicity surrounding ht products and anti depressants such as zoloft  both citizen s group and interests in the united states congress have called for investigation and possible reform of the fda approval process and the fda may impose more stringent standards in approving or monitoring new products compared to the standards applied in the past 
we cannot predict what effect changes in regulations or legal interpretations  if  when and as promulgated may have on our business in the future 
in april  we received a not approvable letter from the fda relating to the nda for our methylphenidate patch 
based on feedback resulting from a meeting with the fda  noven and shire are proceeding with the development of our methylphenidate patch  including another phase study 
if the additional studies are successful and completed on schedule  the parties expect to file an amendment to the pending nda during the amendment is expected to receive a six month review by the fda  and there is no assurance that the data to be obtained from the additional studies will address the fda s issues or that the fda may not raise additional issues following any submission of an amendment to the nda for our methylphenidate patch 
in addition to our methylphenidate patch  we are currently seeking regulatory approval for our fentanyl transdermal system for chronic pain 
our anda for this product was accepted for filing in october and is under review at the fda 
in january  shire s time released amphetamine oral formulation adderall xr was withdrawn in canada by regulators citing safety concerns 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  this development may have on our developmental methylphenidate patch 
we cannot assure that we will obtain the necessary regulatory approval for these products or other products under development or that any such approval will be free from unduly burdensome conditions or limitations 
in light of the whi and other ht studies  it is possible that healthcare regulators could delay the approval of ht products as well as hormonal therapies for hsdd or require that any such new products be subject to more extensive or more rigorous study and testing prior to being approved  or could receive approval subject to more extensive conditions or limitations 
our approved products may not achieve the expected level of market acceptance 
even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for our new products  the success of our products will depend on their market acceptance 
substantially all of our revenues are generated 
table of contents through sales of transdermal delivery systems  which generally are more expensive than oral formations 
our products are marketed primarily to physicians  some of whom are reluctant to prescribe a transdermal delivery system when an alternative delivery system is available 
we and our licensees must demonstrate to prescribing physicians the benefits of transdermal delivery  especially with respect to products such as our methylphenidate patch for which there is presently no transdermal system on the market 
the commercial success of our products is also based in part on patient preference  and difficulties in obtaining patient acceptance of our transdermal delivery systems may similarly impact our ability to market our products 
even if we obtain fda approval for our methylphenidate patch  the market for this product may be negatively affected by the withdrawal of adderall xr in canada as well as ongoing public debate in the united states regarding the appropriateness of using methylphenidate and other medications to treat children with adhd 
we expect that this debate will continue for the foreseeable future 
the outcome of this debate is uncertain  and we cannot predict what impact  if any  the increased public attention will have on the market for products indicated for adhd or on our methylphenidate patch 
because at least part of the stigma results from the fact that most of the current products are schedule ii controlled substances  the non stimulant product sold by eli lilly may benefit from this controversy at the expense of the methylphenidate and amphetamine based products on the market 
see business competition 
failure to comply with our supply agreements or otherwise adequately supply our products to our licensees could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 
our supply agreements with our licensees impose strict obligations on us with respect to the manufacture and supply of our products 
failure to comply with the terms of these supply agreements may result in our being unable to supply product to our licensees  resulting in lost revenues by us and potential responsibility for damages and losses suffered by our licensees 
our supply agreement for vivelle and vivelle dot has expired 
since the expiration of the vivelle supply agreement  the parties have continued to operate in accordance with the supply agreement s commercial terms 
we cannot assure that we will enter into a new supply agreement on satisfactory terms or at all 
it is not clear that the non commercial terms of the supply agreement would be enforceable with respect to post expiration events or occurrences 
due to our dependence on novogyne  we may be unable to negotiate favorable business terms with them or resolve any dispute that we may be involved in with them in a favorable manner 
failure to continue operating in accordance with the supply agreement s commercial terms could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
designation of a new supplier and approval of a new supply agreement would require the affirmative vote of four of the five members of novogyne s management committee 
accordingly  both novartis and noven must agree on novogyne s supplier 
our products may be recalled product recalls or product field alerts may be initiated at our discretion if we have regulatory authority for the product  at the discretion of our partners if they have regulatory authority for the product  at the discretion of the fda or at the discretion of other government agencies 
our products may be recalled for various reasons including the failure of our products to maintain their stability through their expiration dates  manufacturing issues  quality claims  safety issues  disputed labeling claims or other reasons 
as discussed under the caption production issues in item of this report  our combipatch and vivelle dot products have been the subject of product recalls 

table of contents the final field alert for the recall of additional lots of vivelle dot was submitted to the fda on march  and we cannot predict what action  if any  the fda may take with respect to the recalls of vivelle dot 
although noven and novartis are working together in assessing the vivelle dot production issues  the decision to recall product resides with novartis as the holder of the vivelle dot regulatory application and is not within our control 
among others risks  the recent recalls of vivelle dot  or any further impact of the issues causing these recalls  could result in a decision to recall all or a significant portion of the product in distribution until a definitive root cause has been identified and any required corrective action has been completed  cease production or shipment of new product until a definitive root cause has been identified and any required corrective action has been completed  or reduce the shelf life of vivelle dot tm 
although we seek to mitigate the risk of product recalls  we cannot assure that there will not be recalls of our products in the future 
we do not carry any insurance to cover the risk of a potential product recall 
a significant product recall could materially affect our sales  the prescription trends for the products and the reputation of the product and noven 
in these cases  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we face scale up risks in the manufacture of new products in commercial quantities 
our methylphenidate patch and our fentanyl patch are new products that we have never manufactured on a commercial scale 
inefficiencies and other scale up problems may occur in the process of manufacturing new products in commercial quantities 
failure of noven to adequately and timely scale up its manufacturing processes for new products or otherwise meet its supply requirements would adversely affect our revenues and could affect the success of our new product launches 
it may also result in endo  shire or other collaboration partners relying more heavily on second manufacturing sources  thus reducing the manufacturing revenues that we would otherwise realize 
it could also jeopardize our ability to obtain milestone payments under the shire and endo transactions 
in addition  the active ingredients in our methylphenidate patch and our fentanyl patch are more expensive than the active ingredients in our ht patch products 
if we experience manufacturing difficulties such as quality problems  yield deficiencies or similar issues  our overall manufacturing costs may be higher than anticipated 
if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with fda regulations and other governmental agencies  we may be forced to recall products and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our operations are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries with respect to the testing  approval  manufacture  labeling  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products 
these regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things adverse drug experience reporting  product promotion  product pricing and discounting  drug sample accountability  drug product stability  product manufacturing  including good manufacturing practices  and product changes or modifications 
our facilities handle controlled substances  resulting in additional extensive regulatory requirements and oversight 
compliance with the extensive government regulations applicable to our business requires the allocation of significant time  effort and expense 
even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority  product approvals may be withdrawn after the product reaches the market if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur regarding the safety or efficacy of the product 
failure to comply with governmental regulations may result in fines  warning letters  unanticipated compliance expenditures  interruptions or suspension of production and resulting loss of sales  product seizures or recalls  injunctions prohibiting further sales  withdrawal of previously approved marketing 
table of contents applications  and criminal prosecution 
under the terms of the novogyne joint venture  novartis is responsible for providing regulatory services 
while we believe that novartis provides these services adequately  there can be no assurance that a violation of any of these regulations will not have an adverse effect on us 
we rely on a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and compounds used in our products 
certain raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our products  including essential polymer adhesives  are available from limited sources  and  in some cases  a single source 
our nda for our methylphenidate patch includes only one supplier of the active pharmaceutical compound 
this same supplier is also the only source of the active pharmaceutical compound for which we have sought approval under the anda for our transdermal fentanyl system 
regulatory authorities must generally approve raw material sources for transdermal products  and in the case of controlled substances  the dea sets quotas for controlled substances  including methylphenidate  fentanyl and amphetamine  and we must receive authorization from the dea to handle these substances 
we cannot assure that we will be granted sufficient dea quota to meet production requirements for controlled substances 
without adequate approved supplies of raw materials or packaging supplies  our manufacturing operations could be interrupted until another supplier is identified  our products approved and trading terms with it negotiated 
we may not be able to identify an alternative supplier and any supplier that we do identify may not be able to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals in a timely manner  or at all 
furthermore  we may not be able to negotiate favorable terms with an alternative supplier 
any disruptions in our manufacturing operations from the loss of an approved supplier may cause us to incur increased costs and lose revenues and may have an adverse effect on our relationships with our partners and customers  any of which could have adverse effects on our business and results of operations 
some raw materials used in our products are supplied by companies that restrict certain medical uses of their products 
while our use is presently acceptable  there can be no assurance that such companies will not expand their restrictions to include our applications 
our business also faces the risk that third party suppliers may supply us with raw materials that do not meet required specifications  which  if undetected by us  could cause our products to test out of specification and require us to recall the affected product 
we face significant competition  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing products before  or more successfully  than we do 
we face competition from a number of companies in the development of transdermal drug delivery products  and competition is expected to intensify as more companies enter the field 
some of these companies are substantially larger than we are and have greater resources than we do  as well as greater experience in developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products 
as a result  they may succeed before us in developing competing technologies or obtaining governmental approvals for products 
our products compete with other transdermal products as well as alternative dosage forms of the same or comparable chemical entities  as well as non drug therapies 
we expect increased competition in the ht market as a result of the recent launches of a vaginal estrogen delivery system  a combination estrogen progestin patch  an estrogen cream  an estrogen gel products  as well as the expected launch of an ultra low dose estrogen patch 
the adhd market is very competitive and our receipt of the sales based milestones under the shire agreement depends on the sales levels achieved by shire which already markets non methylphenidate adhd products 
other competitors marketing or developing adhd products include johnson johnson  novartis  glaxo smithkline  bristol myers squibb  abbott laboratories  celltech plc  cephalon  inc and eli lilly 
johnson 
table of contents johnson markets concerta  the market leading methylphenidate product  and novartis and eli lilly company lilly market competitive adhd products 
strattera  a non stimulant  non controlled substance therapy  has gained significant market share since launched by lilly in there is at least one clinical study underway comparing the efficacy of strattera to a long acting methylphenidate product 
if strattera or other therapies in development by other companies become recognized as therapeutically superior to stimulants  or are preferred by physicians  parents and or patients  the market for our methylphenidate patch would be adversely affected 
these competitive products  especially those already marketed by shire and those not designated as controlled substances  may negatively impact shire s ability to gain market share for our methylphenidate patch and therefore may decrease the likelihood that we will receive the sales based milestone payments 
if approved by the fda  our fentanyl transdermal system will face a highly competitive market 
currently  the market consists of i duragesic  the branded product  ii a product supplied by the branded manufacturer and sold as a generic by a third party  and iii a generic version of duragesic 
in addition to our anda  we understand that several additional companies have submitted andas for a transdermal fentanyl system 
in the market for generics  the first products to be commercialized typically achieve significant market share 
as competing generic manufacturers receive regulatory approvals  market share  revenues and gross profit of those companies already on the market typically decline  in some cases dramatically 
companies seeking to enter the market with newly approved products will generally seek to gain market share through price reductions and other customer incentives  which can have the effect of reducing pricing and market share for all competitors in the market 
accordingly  the level of market share  revenues and gross profit derived from our fentanyl patch will depend upon the timing of any fda approval for our product  the number of competitors then in the market  and the timing of our launch in relation to competing approvals and launches 
we cannot assure that our products will compete successfully against competitive products or that developments by others will not render our products obsolete or uncompetitive 
if we cannot maintain competitive products and technologies  our current and potential strategic partners may choose to adopt the drug delivery technologies of our competitors or their own internally developed technologies 
competitors may use legal  regulatory and legislative strategies to prevent or delay our launch of generic products such as our developmental transdermal fentanyl system 
the hatch waxman act provides for a period of days of generic marketing exclusivity for each anda applicant that is first to file an anda containing a certification of invalidity  non infringement or unenforceability related to a patent listed with respect to a reference drug product  commonly referred to as a paragraph iv certification 
during this exclusivity period  the fda cannot grant final approval to any other paragraph iv filer 
if an anda containing a paragraph iv certification is successful  it generally results in higher market share  net revenues and gross margin for that applicant for a period of time 
even if we obtain fda approval for generic drug products  we may lose significant advantages to a competitor who was first to file an anda containing a paragraph iv certification 
competitors may also pursue legislative and other regulatory or litigation strategies to prevent or delay our launch of a generic product such as our developmental transdermal fentanyl system 
these strategies include  but are not limited to seeking to obtain new patents on drugs for which patent protection is about to expire  changing the labeling for the branded product  filing a citizen petition with the fda  pursuing state legislative efforts to limit the substitution of generic 
table of contents versions of brand pharmaceuticals  filing patent infringement lawsuits that automatically delay fda approval of many generic products  introducing a second generation product prior to the expiration of market exclusivity for the first generation product which may reduce demand for a generic first generation product  and obtaining market exclusivity extensions by conducting pediatric trials of brand drugs 
the european market for our products may be limited due to pricing pressures and other matters 
pharmaceutical prices  including prices for our products  in europe and certain other countries are significantly lower than in the united states 
because our agreements with novartis pharma provide for us to receive a percentage of novartis pharma s net selling price subject to a minimum price  our gross margins are generally much lower for product sold to novartis pharma for resale outside of the united states than for product sold to novogyne for sale in the united states 
in addition  the lower prices restrict novartis pharma s gross margin realized from selling our products 
because our products compete for sales and marketing resources with other novartis pharma products  including competitive ht products  there can be no assurance that the relatively low gross margins generated from selling our products will not cause novartis pharma to focus its resources on other products or even not launch our products in certain countries 
novartis pharma has launched the product in germany  in spain without the benefit of government reimbursement and in a number of smaller european countries 
we have been advised that novartis pharma is in the process of launching the product through a marketing partner in the united kingdom and france and is in negotiations with regulatory authorities in italy with respect to the reimbursement for estradot in italy 
we cannot assure that novartis pharma will be successful in launching estradot in these or other countries 
the profitability of sales in europe may also be negatively affected by parallel trade practices in the european union whereby a licensed importer may take advantage of price disparity between markets by purchasing our products in a market with a relatively lower price and then importing them into a country with relatively higher price 
in addition  novartis pharma has advised us that they plan to seek marketing approval and commercialization of a lower dosage strength when and if a next generation combination product is developed 
no assurance can be given that we will complete development of a next generation combination estrogen progestin patch or that approval will be obtained  and the timing of any launch of a next generation combination estrogen progestin patch product cannot be predicted 
we expect that growth in this market will be limited unless and until a next generation combination estrogen progestin patch product is developed  approved and launched 
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations 
in  we experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and we expect that revenues from product sales to our licensees as well as our research and development expenditures will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending upon various factors not in our control  including the purchasing patterns of wholesale drug distributors  marketing efforts of each licensee  fluctuations in sales and returns allowances  including those related to allowances for expiring product as well as product recalls  the inventory requirements of each licensee  the impact of competitive products  the timing and scope of estalis and estradot launches and commercialization efforts by novartis pharma  combipatch prescription trends in the united states  the impact of the ht studies on prescriptions for our hormone replacement products  the product pricing of each licensee  the timing of certain royalty reconciliations and payments under our license agreements  the timing of fda approval  including our methylphenidate patch or our fentanyl patch  
table of contents if any  and any subsequent product launch of new products  and the success of endo s and shire s commercialization efforts 
our earnings may fluctuate because of  among other things  fluctuations in research and development spending resulting from the timing of clinical trials involving products in development 
novartis is entitled to an annual million preferred return  which has the effect of reducing our share of novogyne s income in the first quarter of each year 
our results of operations will be adversely affected if novogyne or we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require noven and novogyne to test the recoverability of their respective long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference 
novogyne recorded the acquisition of the combipatch product marketing rights at cost and tests this asset for impairment on a periodic basis 
any further adverse change in the market for ht products could have a material adverse impact on the ability of novogyne to recover its investment in its combipatch marketing rights  which could require novogyne to revalue that asset 
impairment of that asset would adversely affect novogyne s  and consequently our  operating results 
we cannot be certain of the protection or confidentiality of our patents and proprietary rights 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain or license patents for our products  processes and technologies 
if we do not do so  our competitors may exploit our innovations and deprive us of the ability to realize revenues from those innovations 
there is no assurance that we will be issued patents for any of our patent applications  that any existing or future patents that we receive or license will provide competitive advantages for our products  or that we will be able to enforce successfully our patent rights 
additionally  there can be no assurance that our patents or any future patents will prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products  or challenging  invalidating or avoiding our patent applications or any existing or future patents that we receive or license 
many of our patents are formulation patents and would not preclude others from developing and marketing products that deliver drugs transdermally or otherwise through non infringing formulations 
furthermore  there is no assurance that any of our future processes or products will be patentable  that any pending or additional patents will be issued in any or all appropriate jurisdictions or that our processes or products will not infringe upon the patents of third parties 
we also rely on trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation 
we use confidentiality agreements with licensees  suppliers  employees and consultants to protect our trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation  but there can be no assurance that these parties will not breach their agreements with us or that we will be able to effectively enforce our rights under those agreements 
we also cannot be certain that we will have adequate remedies for any breach 
disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements 
furthermore  we cannot be sure that our trade secrets and proprietary technology will not otherwise become known or that our competitors will not independently develop our trade secrets and proprietary technology 

table of contents third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights  forcing us to expend substantial resources in resulting litigation  the outcome of which is uncertain 
any unfavorable outcome could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 
our success will also depend  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others  and there can be no assurance that our products and processes will not infringe upon the patents of others 
third parties may also institute patent litigation against us for competitive reasons unrelated to any infringement by us 
if a third party asserts a claim of infringement  we may have to seek licenses  defend infringement actions or challenge the validity of those third party patents in court 
if we cannot obtain the required licenses  or are found liable for infringement or are not able to have these patents declared invalid  we may be liable for significant monetary damages  encounter significant delays in bringing products to market or be precluded from participating in the manufacture  use or sale of products or methods of drug delivery covered by the patents of others 
there can be no assurance that we have identified  or that in the future we will be able to identify  all us and foreign patents that may pose a risk of potential infringement claims 
we may experience reductions in the levels of reimbursement for our products by governmental authorities  private health insurers and managed care organizations 
our ability and our marketing partners ability to commercialize our products  including our methylphenidate patch  is dependent in part on obtaining reimbursement from government health authorities  private health insurers and managed care organizations 
the trend toward managed healthcare in the united states and the prominence of health maintenance organizations hmos and similar entities could significantly influence the purchase of our products  resulting in lower prices and lower demand 
this is particularly true in a market that includes generic alternatives  such as the adhd market 
there can be no assurance that shire will obtain acceptable reimbursement status for our methylphenidate patch 
additionally  if strattera  a non stimulant adhd treatment  becomes recognized as therapeutically superior to stimulant based treatments such as our methylphenidate patch  the reimbursement status of our methylphenidate patch may be adversely affected 
there can also be no assurance that managed care agreements established by novartis will not adversely affect novogyne s financial results 
health care reform or other changes in government regulation could harm our business 
the federal and state governments in the united states  as well as many foreign governments  from time to time explore ways to reduce medical care costs through health care reform 
in the united states  these proposals include government programs involving prescription drug reimbursement benefits for seniors 
due to the diverse range of proposals put forth from country to country and the uncertainty of any proposal s adoption  we cannot predict what impact any reform proposal ultimately adopted may have on the pharmaceutical industry or on our business  financial position or results of operations 
we may be exposed to product liability claims and there can be no assurance of adequate insurance 
like all pharmaceutical companies  the testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to potential product liability and other claims resulting from their use 
noven has been named as a defendant in one case in which a plaintiff alleges personal injury from the use of ht products  including combipatch  which is manufactured by noven and distributed by novogyne 
in 
table of contents addition  novartis has advised noven that novartis has been named as a defendant in at least additional lawsuits involving approximately plaintiffs that allege liability in connection with personal injury claims allegedly arising from the use of ht patches distributed and sold by novartis and novogyne  including noven products  vivelle  vivelle dot tm and combipatch 
if any such claims against us are successful  we may be required to make significant compensation payments and suffer the associated adverse publicity 
even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds in litigation and the diversion of management time and resources 
we maintain product liability insurance  but there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover all future claims or that we will be able to maintain existing coverage or obtain additional coverage at reasonable rates 
our product liability insurance policy is more expensive with significantly less coverage and higher deductibles than in previous years 
if a claim is not covered or if our coverage is insufficient  we may incur significant liability payments that would negatively affect our business  financial position or results of operations 
all of our products are manufactured at one location 
an interruption of production at this facility could negatively affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
all of our products are manufactured at a single facility in miami  florida 
an interruption of manufacturing resulting from regulatory issues  technical problems  casualty loss including hurricane or other factors could result in our inability to meet production requirements  which may cause us to lose revenues and which could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our partners and customers  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations 
without our existing production facility  we would have no other means of manufacturing our products until we were able to restore the manufacturing capability at our facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility 
although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenues and profits resulting from casualty losses  this insurance does not cover all possible situations and there can be no assurance that any event of casualty to our facility would be covered by such insurance 
in addition  our business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact on relations with our existing partners and customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate and rising insurance premiums could negatively affect our profitability 
we rely on insurance to protect us from many business risks  including product liability  business interruption  property and casualty loss  employment practices liability and directors and officers liability 
the cost of insurance has risen significantly in the past year 
in response  we may increase deductibles and or decrease certain coverages to mitigate these costs 
there can be no assurance that the insurance that we maintain and intend to maintain will be adequate  or that the cost of insurance and limitations in coverage will not adversely affect our business  financial position or results of operations 
furthermore  if is possible that  in some cases  coverage may not be available at any price 
we enter into agreements that include provisions that require us to indemnify the other party 
our financial position and results of operations could be harmed if we are required to perform under these indemnification provisions 
in the normal course of business  we enter into license  supply  employment and other agreements that include indemnification provisions 
the novogyne joint venture operating 
table of contents agreement contains an indemnification provision as do certain supply and license agreements between and among noven  novartis and novogyne 
the various indemnification provisions in these agreements are not uniform and  depending on the circumstances  may be subject to differing legal interpretations 
as a consequence  it may be difficult in certain circumstances for us to determine or predict in advance what indemnification obligations noven may owe to novogyne or novartis under these provisions or  alternatively  what obligations may be owed to noven by these parties  including as it relates to potential damages  settlement amounts and defense costs associated with the product liability lawsuits that claim the use of products manufactured by noven and distributed by novogyne 
while insurance coverage may mitigate the costs of some of our obligations under these indemnification provisions  our business  financial position and results of operations could be harmed if we are required to perform under these indemnification provisions and there is no or insufficient insurance coverage 
our success depends on attracting and retaining our key employees 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced personnel 
we face significant competition in recruiting talented personnel 
in the past  our location in an area with relatively few pharmaceutical companies has made recruitment more difficult  as many candidates prefer to work in places with a broad pharmaceutical industry presence 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain additional  competent employees  could adversely affect our business  financial position or results of operations 
our stockholders rights plan  our charter documents  delaware law and our joint venture with novartis may have an anti takeover effect 
our stockholders rights plan  our corporate charter documents  delaware law and our joint venture operating agreement with novartis each include provisions that may discourage or prevent parties from attempting to acquire us 
these provisions may have the effect of depriving our stockholders of the opportunity to sell their stock at a price in excess of prevailing market prices in an acquisition of noven 
we have a stockholders rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill  which is intended to cause substantial dilution to a person or group who attempts to acquire us on terms that our board of directors has not approved 
the existence of the stockholders rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our common stock without the consent of our board of directors 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting common stock 
these include provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders  call special meetings or nominate candidates to serve on our board of directors 
we are also subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
for purposes of section  a business combination includes a merger  asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder  and an interested stockholder is a person who  either alone or together with affiliates and associates  owns or within the past three years  did own or more of the corporation s voting stock 

table of contents the operating agreement for our joint venture with novartis has a buy sell provision that either party may trigger by notifying the other party of the price at which the triggering party would be willing to acquire the joint venture 
as a result of the buy sell provision  any potential acquirer of noven faces the possibility that novartis could trigger this provision at any time and thereby require the acquirer to either purchase for cash novartis interest in novogyne which would include the net present value of novartis million annual preferred return or to sell its interest in novogyne to novartis 
the existence of the buy sell provision and the uncertainty it may create could discourage an acquisition of noven by a third party  which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock 
finally  the operating agreement gives novartis the right to dissolve the joint venture in the event of a change in control of noven if the acquirer is one of the ten largest pharmaceutical companies as measured by annual dollar sales 
upon dissolution  novartis would reacquire the rights to market vivelle and vivelle dot subject to the terms of novartis prior arrangement with us  and novogyne s other assets would be liquidated and distributed to the parties in accordance with their capital account balances as determined pursuant to the joint venture operating agreement 
this dissolution provision could have an anti takeover effect with respect to a top ten pharmaceutical company
