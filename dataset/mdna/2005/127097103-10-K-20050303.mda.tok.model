item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
please read forward looking information on page we operate in one segment  natural gas and oil exploration and development 
overview cabot oil gas is a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  development and exploitation of natural gas and crude oil from its properties in north america 
our exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources  which are conducive to multi well  repeatable drilling programs 
our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 
at cabot  there are three types of investment alternatives that constantly compete for available capital 
these include drilling opportunities  acquisition opportunities and financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock 
depending on circumstances  we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate of return approach 
our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms 
price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years 
throughout and  the futures market reported unprecedented natural gas and crude oil contract prices 
our realized natural gas and crude oil price  net of the impact of derivative instruments  was per mcf and per bbl  respectively  in to ensure a certain rate of return for our program  we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price collars and swaps 
these financial instruments are an integral element of our risk management strategy but prevented us from realizing the full impact of the price environment 
commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control 
historically  commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands  which are impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas and crude oil prices  and therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
the tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated over the course of and index represents the henry hub index price per mmbtu 
the and price is the natural gas price per mcf realized by us and includes the realized impact of our natural gas price collar and swap arrangements  as applicable

in  there was an after tax impairment of million related to our kurten field see limited partnership for discussion of the impairment 
in addition  the stronger price environment contributed to the earnings increase 
prices  including the impact of the hedge arrangements  rose for natural gas and for oil 
we drilled gross wells with a success rate of in compared to gross wells with an success rate in total capital and exploration expenditures increased million to million in compared to million for we believe our operating cash flow in will be sufficient to fund our capital and exploration budgeted spending of approximately million and again provide excess cash flow 
any excess cash flow may be used for acquisitions  to pay current debt due  repurchase common stock  expand our capital program or other opportunities 
our strategy will remain consistent with focusing on a disciplined approach to investment that balances our drilling effort between exploration opportunities and the development program  along with acquisition opportunities and a continued financial focus including stock buyback and debt repayment 
the preceding paragraphs  discussing our strategic pursuits and goals  contain forward looking information 
please read forward looking information on page 
table of contents financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary source of cash in was from funds generated from operations 
proceeds from the sale of common stock under stock option plans during roughly offset our repurchase of  treasury shares of company stock at a weighted average purchase price of 
the company generates cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil 
operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout the recent years 
working capital is substantially influenced by these variables 
fluctuation in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures 
see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 
cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to fund exploration and development expenditures  purchase treasury stock and pay dividends 
see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 
year ended december  cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used by investing activities cash flows used by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased million over this increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices 
key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices  production volumes and operating costs 
average realized natural gas prices increased over  while crude oil realized prices increased over the same period 
production volumes declined slightly  with a percent reduction of equivalent production in compared to while we believe commodity production may exceed levels  we are unable to predict future commodity prices  and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities

production volumes declined slightly with a reduction of equivalent production in compared to see page for a discussion on commodity prices and results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue 

table of contents investing activities 
the primary driver of cash used by investing activities is capital spending and exploration expense 
we establish the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices 
due to the volatility of commodity prices our budget may be periodically adjusted during any given year 
cash flows used in investing activities increased for the years ended december  and in the amounts of million and million 
the increase from to is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity as a result of higher commodity prices 
this increase largely occurred in our east region and the rocky mountain area of our west region 
our initial drilling activity in canada also contributed to the increase 
cash flows used in investing activities increased from to due to an increase in capital spending and exploration expense in response to higher commodity prices and exploitation of acquired properties 
this increase was partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of certain non strategic assets 
financing activities 
cash flows used by financing activities were million for the year ended december  this is the result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by the purchase of treasury shares and dividend payments 
cash flows used by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this is substantially due to a net repayment on our revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
cash utilized for the repayments was generated from operating cash flows 
the cash flows used by financing activities in is primarily due to a net repayment on our revolving credit facility of million 
the available credit line under our revolving credit facility  which was million at year end  but can be expanded up to million  is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the bank s petroleum engineer and other assets 
at december   we had no outstanding balance on the credit facility 
the revolving term of the credit facility ends in december we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity 
management believes that we have the ability to finance through new debt or equity offerings  if necessary  our capital requirements  including acquisitions 
our board of directors authorized the repurchase of two million shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions 
all purchases executed have been through open market transactions 
there is no expiration date associated with the authorization to repurchase securities of the company 
see issuer purchases of equity securities in item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer repurchases of equity securities for additional information 

table of contents capitalization information about our capitalization is as follows december  in millions debt stockholders equity total capitalization debt to capitalization cash and cash equivalents includes million of current portion of long term debt in includes common stock  net of treasury stock 
includes the impact of the accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  and of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we paid dividends of million on our common stock 
a regular dividend of per share of common stock has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company 
capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis  we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities  excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations and  when necessary  our revolving credit facility 
we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 
the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december  in millions capital expenditures drilling and facilities leasehold acquisitions pipeline and gathering other proved property acquisitions exploration expense total we plan to drill about gross wells in compared with gross wells drilled in this drilling program includes approximately million in total capital and exploration expenditures  up from million in we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 
there are many factors that impact our depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
these include reserve additions and revisions  development costs  impairments and changes in anticipated production in a future period 
in management expects an increase in our depreciation  depletion and amortization rate due to production declines and higher capital costs 
this change may result in an increase of depreciation  depletion and amortization of to greater than levels 
this increase will not have an impact on our cash flows 

table of contents contractual obligations our known material contractual obligations include long term debt  interest on long term debt and operating leases 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations  and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
a summary of our known contractual obligations as of december  are set forth in the following table payments due by year in thousands total to to beyond long term debt interest on long term debt firm gas transportation agreements operating leases total contractual cash obligations including current portion 
interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rate of our million long term debt outstanding at december  at december  we had no outstanding debt on our revolving credit facility 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details of long term debt 
amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures 
the total amount of asset retirement obligations at december  is million 
potential impact of our critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the most significant policies are discussed below 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain  and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysic  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the degree of uncertainty varies among the three regions in which we operate 
the estimation of reserves in the gulf coast region requires more estimates than the east and west regions and inherently has more uncertainty surrounding reserve estimation 
the differences in the reserve estimation process are substantially due to the geological conditions in which the wells are drilled 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices 
additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
in  and  of our reserves were subject to an external review by miller lents  ltd  an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm  who in their opinion determined the estimates to be reasonable in the aggregate 
additionally  in  and  we did not have a significant reserve revision recorded 
for more information regarding reserve estimation  including historical reserve revisions  refer to the supplemental oil and gas disclosure beginning on page 
table of contents our rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves  which is utilized in our unit of production method calculation 
if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced  the rate at which we record dd a expense would increase  reducing net income 
such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices  which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the company would decrease or increase the dd a rate by approximately to per mcfe 
revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dd a rate 
it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of in one of our most productive fields would have a impact on our total dd a rate 
in addition  a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process  risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties  and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis  management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 
carrying value of oil and gas properties we evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a lease by lease basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials  as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows 
in there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test 
in we significantly revised the estimated cash flow utilized in our impairment review of the kurten field due to a loss of a reversionary interest in the field 
in december our remaining interest in the field was sold 
for additional discussion on the kurten field impairment see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test 
costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above  however  a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives 
average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights 
historically  the average property lives in each of the regions have not significantly changed 
however  if the average property life increases  the amount of the amortization charge in a given reporting period will decrease 
if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately million or decrease by approximately million  respectively per year 
in the past the average leasehold life in the gulf coast region has been shorter than the average life in the east and west regions 
average property lives in the gulf coast  east and west regions have been four  six and six years  respectively 
average property lives in canada are estimated to be five years 
as these properties are developed and reserves are proven  the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful  the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made 
the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program 

table of contents accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production 
we follow the accounting prescribed in sfas under sfas  the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at the end of each period  these instruments are marked to market 
the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as other comprehensive income  a component of equity  to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as an effective hedge 
under sfas  effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale 
for example  a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated  and effective  if the underlying gas were sold at the henry hub index 
any portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the sfas test are recorded immediately as a component of operating revenue on the statement of operations 
long term employee benefit costs our costs of long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement benefits  are incurred over long periods of time  and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is management s responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties 
it also is management s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 
the current benefit service costs  as well as the existing liabilities  for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis 
the discount rate is a current rate  related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled 
our assumed discount rate is based on average rates published for high quality fixed income securities 
the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
as of december   the assumed rate of increase was 
the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption 
the expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate  and reflects long term expectations  rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 
the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets 
management s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 
stock based compensation prior to the issuance of sfas r share based payment  there were two alternative methods that could be used to account for stock based compensation 
the first method is the intrinsic value method and recognizes compensation cost as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
the second method is the fair value method 
under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
currently  we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method 
sfas r requires that the fair value of stock options and any other equity based compensation must be expensed at the grant date 
to calculate the fair value  either a binomial or black scholes valuation model may be used 
we currently expense performance share awards  however  beginning in the third quarter of  we will be required to expense all stock based compensation 
further discussion of sfas r and stock compensation is included in recently issued accounting pronouncements on page 
table of contents other issues and contingencies corporate income tax 
we generated tax credits for the production of certain qualified fuels  including natural gas produced from tight sands formations and devonian shale 
the credit for natural gas from a tight sand formation tight gas sands amounted to per mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to from qualified wells drilled in and a number of wells drilled in the east region and rocky mountains during and qualified for the tight gas sands tax credit 
the credit for natural gas produced from devonian shale was per mmbtu in in and  we completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits  resulting in revenues of million in the tax credit wells were repurchased in december and no tax credits were generated in or as the credits expired in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of the act 
the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions 
the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after the repeal of the excess idc preference can not reduce a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income by more than of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 
regulations 
our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
see regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation and environmental regulations in the other business matters section of item business for a discussion of these regulations 
restrictive covenants 
our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the company s various debt instruments 
among other requirements  our revolving credit agreement and the notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of to at december   we are in compliance with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and the notes 
in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants  the company may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender  which  if granted  would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 
see further discussion in capital resources and liquidity 
limited partnership 
as part of the cody acquisition  we acquired an interest in certain oil and gas properties in the kurten field  as general partner of a partnership and as an operator 
we had approximately a interest in the field  including a one percent interest in the partnership 
under the partnership agreement  we had the right to a reversionary working interest that would bring our ultimate interest to upon the limited partner reaching payout 
based on the addition of this reversionary interest  and because the field has over a year reserve life  approximately million was allocated to this field under purchase accounting at the time of the acquisition 
additionally  the limited partner had the sole option to trigger a liquidation of the partnership 
effective february   liquidation of the partnership commenced at the election of the limited partner 
the limited partner was a financial entity and not an industry operator 
their decision to liquidate was based upon their perception that the value of their investment in the partnership had increased due to an increase in underlying commodity prices  primarily oil  since their investment in we proceeded with the liquidation to avoid having a minority interest in a non operated water flood field for which the new operator was not designated at the time of liquidation 
in connection with the liquidation  an appraisal was required to be obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets 
additionally  we were required to test the field for recoverability in accordance with fas pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement and based on the appraised value of the partnership assets it was not possible for us to obtain the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation 
due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the kurten field  the limited partner s decision and our decision to proceed with the liquidation  an impairment review was performed which required an after tax impairment charge in the first quarter of of million 
this impairment charge is reflected in the statement of operations as an operating expense but did not impact our cash flows 

table of contents operating risks and insurance coverage 
our business involves a variety of operating risks  including blowouts  cratering and explosions  mechanical problems  uncontrolled flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  pollution and other environmental risks  and natural disasters 
the operation of our natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks  including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures 
the location of pipelines near populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites  could increase these risks 
any of these events could result in loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution  impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses 
the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate 
during the past few years  we have invested a significant portion of our drilling dollars in the gulf coast  where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the east 
commodity pricing and risk management activities 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results 
in particular  substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 
the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
however  management may mitigate this price risk with the use of financial instruments 
most recently  we have used financial instruments such as price collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue 
under both arrangements  there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in the company not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of this fsp provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits 
this fsp also requires those employers to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the act the subsidy 
this fsp supersedes fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of and is effective for the first interim period beginning after june  our current accumulated projected benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost does not reflect any amount associated with the subsidy 
furthermore  in  we amended our postretirement benefit plan to exclude prescription drug benefits for participants age and older effective january  the adoption of this fsp is not expected to impact our operating results  financial position or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

table of contents in february  the fasb released for public comment proposed staff position fas a accounting for suspended well costs 
this proposed staff position would amend fasb statement no 
financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies and provides guidance about exploratory well costs to companies who use the successful efforts method of accounting 
the proposed position states that exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized if a sufficient quantity of reserved are discovered in the well to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is made in assessing the reserves and the well s economic and operating feasibility 
if the exploratory well costs do not meet both of these criteria  these costs should be expensed  net of any salvage value 
additional disclosures are required to provide information about management s evaluation of capitalized exploratory well costs 
in addition  the staff position requires the disclosure of net changes from period to period of capitalized exploratory well costs for wells that are pending the determination of proved reserves  the amount of exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year after the completion of drilling and an aging of exploratory well costs suspended for greater than one year with the number of wells it related to 
further  the disclosures should describe the activities undertaken to evaluate the reserves and the projects  the information still required to classify the associated reserves as proved and the estimated timing for completing the evaluation 
although this staff position is not final and has not been adopted by us  we have included the additional disclosures in note comments on this proposed fsp are expected by march  forward looking information the statements regarding future financial and operating performance and results  market prices  future hedging activities  and other statements that are not historical facts contained in this report are forward looking statements 
the words expect  project  estimate  believe  anticipate  intend  budget  plan  forecast  predict  may  should  could  will and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  market factors  market prices including regional basis differentials of natural gas and oil  results for future drilling and marketing activity  future production and costs and other factors detailed herein and in our other securities and exchange commission filings 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated 

table of contents results of operations and compared we reported net income for the year ended december  of million  or per share 
during  we reported net income of million  or per share 
operating income increased by million compared to the prior year  from million to million 
the increase in net income and operating income was principally due to decreased operating expenses from to related to the decrease in impairments of oil and gas properties of million related to the loss in of a reversionary interest in the kurten field 
in addition  the increases in operating income and net income were due to an increase in our realized natural gas and crude oil prices 
natural gas production revenues our average total company realized natural gas production sales price  including the realized impact of derivative instruments  was per mcf compared to per mcf for the comparable period of the prior year 
these prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced these prices by per mcf in and per mcf in the following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of million and the unrealized loss of million for the years ended december  and  respectively

natural gas production was up slightly from the prior year and production revenues also increased from natural gas production increased slightly in all regions except the west region  where the decline in production was due to lower capital spending in and continued natural decline 
the increases in both sales price and production resulted in an increase in natural gas production revenues of million

this change was primarily a result of decreases in natural gas transportation revenue and natural gas liquid revenue for the year ended december  operating expenses total costs and expenses from operations decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows brokered natural gas cost decreased million 
for additional information related to this decrease see the analysis performed for brokered natural gas revenue and cost 
exploration expense decreased million primarily as a result of higher dry hole expense in during  we drilled dry exploratory wells compared to in the corresponding period of depreciation  depletion and amortization increased  as anticipated  by approximately or million 
the increase was primarily due to negative reserve revisions in south louisiana in  which increased the per mcfe dd a rate

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk oil and gas prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas 
the level of consumer product demand 
weather conditions 
political conditions in oil producing regions  including the middle east 
the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls 
the price of foreign imports 
actions of governmental authorities 
domestic and foreign governmental regulations 
the price  availability and acceptance of alternative fuels 
overall economic conditions 
these factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil and gas 
our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets 
a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection 
these hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit of increases in prices 
please read the discussion below related to commodity price swaps for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 
derivative instruments and hedging activity periodically  we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production 
at december   we had cash flow hedges open natural gas price collar arrangements  one crude oil collar arrangement and natural gas price swap arrangements 
additionally  we had two crude oil financial instruments open at december   that did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas at december   a million million net of tax unrealized loss was recorded to other comprehensive income  along with a million derivative liability and a million derivative receivable 
the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges that is effective is initially recorded to other comprehensive income 
the ineffective portion  if any  of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges  and the change in fair value of all other derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue  as appropriate 

table of contents the following table summarizes the realized and unrealized impact of derivative activity reflected in the respective line item in operating revenues 
year ended december  in thousands realized unrealized realized unrealized realized unrealized operating revenues increase decrease to revenue natural gas production crude oil assuming no change in commodity prices  after december  we would reclassify to earnings  over the next months  million in after tax expenditures associated with commodity derivatives 
this reclassification represents the net liability associated with open positions currently not reflected in earnings at december  related to anticipated production 
hedges on production swaps from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
under these price swaps  we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index  such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 
under our revolving credit agreement  the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period covered by these cash flow hedges 
during  natural gas price swaps covered  mmcf  or of our gas production  fixing the sales price of this gas at an average of per mcf 
at december   we had open natural gas price swap contracts covering production as follows natural gas price swaps contract period volume in mmcf weighted average contract price unrealized gain loss in thousands as of december  natural gas price swaps on production in first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil derivative arrangements that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas these financial instruments are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date 
at december   we had two open crude oil swap arrangements with an unrealized net loss of million recognized in operating revenues 

table of contents hedges on production options from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes 
under the collar arrangements  if the index price rises above the ceiling price  we pay the counterparty 
if the index falls below the floor price  the counterparty pays us 
during  natural gas price collars covered  mmcf of our gas production  or of our gas production with a weighted average floor of per mcf and a weighted average ceiling of per mcf 
at december   we had open natural gas price collar contracts covering our production as follows natural gas price collars contract period volume in mmcf weighted average ceiling floor unrealized gain loss in thousands as of december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year at december   we had one open crude oil price collar contract covering our production as follows crude oil price collar contract period volume in mbbl weighted average ceiling floor unrealized gain loss in thousands as of december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts  to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil 
however  the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged 
the preceding paragraphs contain forward looking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses  which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities
