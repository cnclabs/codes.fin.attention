other real estate assets include office and retail buildings and industrial properties 
the company s major tenants include supermarket chains and other retailers who sell basic necessities 
at october   the company owned or had controlling interests in properties containing a total of million square feet of gla of which approximately was leased at october  the company focuses on increasing cash flow and  consequently  the value of its properties and seeks continued growth through strategic re leasing  renovations and expansion of its existing properties and selective acquisition of income producing properties  primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers in the northeastern part of the united states 
key elements of the company s growth strategies and operating policies are to acquire neighborhood and community shopping centers in the northeastern part of the united states with a concentration in fairfield county  connecticut  and westchester and putnam counties  new york hold core properties for long term investment and enhance their value through regular maintenance  periodic renovation and capital improvement selectively dispose of non core assets and re deploy the proceeds into properties located in the company s preferred region increase property values by aggressively marketing available gla and renewing existing leases renovate  reconfigure or expand existing properties to meet the needs of existing or new tenants negotiate and sign leases which provide for regular or fixed contractual increases to minimum rents control property operating and administrative costs critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
revenue recognition the company records base rents on a straight line basis over the term of each lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in tenant receivables on the accompanying balance sheets 
most leases contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area expenses 
these amounts are recognized in the period the related expenses are incurred 
expense reimbursement payments generally are made monthly based on an estimated amount determined at the beginning of the year 
the difference between the actual amount due and the estimated amounts paid by the tenant throughout the year is billed or credited to the tenant 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts and mortgage notes receivable is established based on a quarterly analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivables  the payment history of the tenants or other debtors  the financial condition of the tenants and management s assessment of their ability to meet their lease obligations  the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations  among other things 
management s estimates of the required allowance is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on tenants  particularly those at retail centers 
estimates are used to establish reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance  real estate tax and insurance costs 
adjustments are also made throughout the year to tenant receivables and the related cost recovery income based upon the company s best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected 
the company analyzes the balance of its estimated accounts receivable for real estate taxes  common area maintenance and insurance for each of its properties by comparing actual recoveries versus actual expenses and any actual write offs 
based on its analysis  the company may record an additional amount in its allowance for doubtful accounts related to these items 
it is also the company s policy to maintain an allowance of approximately of the deferred straight line rents receivable balance for future tenant credit losses 
real estate land  buildings  property improvements  furniture fixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
renovations and or replacements  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the amounts to be capitalized as a result of an acquisition and the periods over which the assets are depreciated or amortized are determined based on estimates as to fair value and the allocation of various costs to the individual assets 
the company allocates the cost of an acquisition based upon the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
the company also estimates the fair value of intangibles related to its acquisitions 
the valuation of the fair value of intangibles involves estimates related to market conditions  probability of lease renewals and the current market value of in place leases 
this market value is determined by considering factors such as the tenant s industry  location within the property and competition in the specific region in which the property operates 
differences in the amount attributed to the intangible assets can be significant based upon the assumptions made in calculating these estimates 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful life of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
properties are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are as follows buildings years property improvements years furniture fixtures years tenant improvements shorter of lease term or useful life assessments by the company of certain other lease related costs are made when the company has a reason to believe that the tenant may not be able to perform under the terms of the lease as originally expected 
this requires management to make estimates as to the recoverability of such assets 
asset impairment on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties and mortgage notes receivable may be impaired 
a property value is considered impaired when management s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property 
such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income  trend and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss is measured as the excess of the net carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the asset 
changes in estimated future cash flows due to changes in the company s plans or market and economic conditions could result in recognition of impairment losses which could be substantial 
management does not believe that the value of any of its rental properties or mortgage notes receivable is impaired at october  liquidity and capital resources at october   the company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million in the company s sources of liquidity and capital resources include its cash and cash equivalents  proceeds from bank borrowings and long term mortgage debt  capital financings and sales of real estate investments 
payments of expenses related to real estate operations  debt service  management and professional fees  and dividend requirements place demands on the company s short term liquidity 
cash flows the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements primarily by generating net cash from the operations of its properties 
the company believes that its net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund its short term liquidity requirements for fiscal and to meet its dividend requirements necessary to maintain its reit status 
in fiscal  and  net cash provided by operations amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
cash dividends paid increased to million in compared to million in and million in the company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders 
these dividends will be paid from operating cash flows which are expected to increase due to property acquisitions and growth in operating income in the existing portfolio and from other sources 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from tenants under existing leases at its properties 
the company s operating cash flow therefore depends on the rents that it is able to charge to its tenants  and the ability of its tenants to make rental payments 
the company believes that the nature of the properties in which it typically invests primarily grocery anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers provides a more stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  in that consumers still need to purchase basic staples and convenience items 
however  even in the geographic areas in which the company owns properties  general economic downturns may adversely impact the ability of the company s tenants to make lease payments and the company s ability to re lease space as leases expire 
in either of these cases  the company s cash flow could be adversely affected 
capital resources the company expects to fund its long term liquidity requirements such as property acquisitions  repayment of indebtedness and capital expenditures through other long term indebtedness including indebtedness assumed in acquisitions  proceeds from sales of properties and or the issuance of equity securities 
the company believes that these sources of capital will continue to be available to it in the future to fund its long term capital needs  however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on its access to capital sources 
the company s ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon its existing leverage  the value of its unencumbered assets and borrowing limitations imposed by existing lenders 
the company s ability to raise funds through sales of equity securities is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about the company and its stock price in the market 
the company s ability to sell properties in the future to raise cash will be dependent upon market conditions at the time of sale 
financings and debt during fiscal  the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s for up to million of debt securities  preferred stock  depository shares  common stock and class a common stock 
as of october   the company has million available for issuance under this shelf registration statement 
in may  the company sold  shares of a new issue of series c cumulative preferred stock series c preferred stock for net proceeds of million 
the series c preferred stock issue entitles the holders to a cumulative dividend 
the company used a portion of the proceeds to purchase retail properties in and the company intends to use the balance of the proceeds for property acquisitions during fiscal the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
mortgage notes payable consist of  of fixed rate mortgage loan indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of at october  the mortgage loans are secured by fourteen properties and have fixed rates of interest ranging from to 
the company anticipates that it will make principal mortgage payments due in fiscal from available cash 
the company expects to refinance a majority of its mortgage loans  at or prior to scheduled maturity  through replacement mortgage loans 
the ability to do so  however  is dependent upon various factors  including the income level of the properties  interest rates and credit conditions within the commercial real estate market 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that such refinancing can be achieved 
at october   the company had a secured revolving credit facility with a bank which expires in october and allows for borrowings up to million 
the secured credit line is collateralized by two properties having a net book value of million at october  the company intends to seek renewal of the facility at its scheduled expiration 
the company also has a million unsecured revolving line of credit with the same bank which was scheduled to expire in january in december  the company extended the unsecured credit line for an additional one year period 
extensions of credit under the unsecured credit line are at the bank s discretion and subject to the bank s satisfaction of certain conditions 
both revolving credit lines are available to finance the acquisition  management and or development of commercial real estate  refinance indebtedness and for working capital purposes 
there were no borrowings on either credit line during the year and there were no outstanding borrowings at october  contractual obligations the company s contractual payment obligations as of october   were as follows amounts in thousands payments due by period total thereafter mortgage notes payable        tenant obligations   total contractual obligations        committed tenant related obligations based on executed leases as of october  the company has various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to its property management 
in addition  the company also has certain other utility contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business which may extend beyond one year  which very based on usage 
these contracts include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties 
contract terms are generally one year or less 
off balance sheet arrangements during the twelve month periods ended october  and  the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
capital expenditures the company invests in its existing properties and regularly incurs capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain its properties 
the company believes that such expenditures enhance the competitiveness of its properties 
in each of the three years ended october   the company incurred approximately million for capital expenditures for property improvements and tenant allowances and commissions in connection with the company s leasing activities 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly depending on tenant negotiations  market conditions and rental rates 
the company expects to incur an additional million for expected capital improvements and leasing costs in fiscal these expenditures are expected to be funded from operating cash flows or borrowings 
acquisitions and sales the company seeks to acquire properties which are primarily shopping centers located in the northeastern part of the united states 
in fiscal  the company acquired four retail properties totaling  square feet of leasable space  for a total purchase price of million 
in connection with the acquisition of three of the properties  the company assumed mortgage loans totaling million 
in fiscal  the company acquired four properties totaling  square feet in separate transactions for approximately million 
the properties were purchased with cash raised from sales of equity securities and consisted of the westchester pavilion in white plains  new york  for million  the orange meadows shopping center in orange  connecticut  for million  the greens farms plaza in westport  connecticut  for million and seven retail building units in somers commons in somers  new york for million 
in fiscal  the company acquired a general partner interest in a shopping center in stamford  connecticut for million 
the property was acquired subject to a million first mortgage loan 
the company also purchased a shopping center in danbury  connecticut for million subject to a first mortgage loan of million and acquired the remaining interest in an office building that it did not own for a purchase price of million 
shortly after the close of fiscal  the company sold its farmingdale  new york property for million 
the proceeds are expected to be used to acquire additional properties in the company s target acquisition area 
on december   the company contracted to purchase four retail properties totaling  square feet in new york for an aggregate purchase price of million 
on january   the company acquired a  square foot shopping center located in stratford  connecticut for million  excluding closing costs 
the acquisition was funded with available cash and borrowings of million under the company s secured line of credit 
non core assets in a prior year  the company s board of directors expanded and refined the strategic objectives of the company to refocus its real estate portfolio into one of self managed retail properties located in the northeast and authorized the sale of the company s non core properties in the normal course of business over a period of several years 
the non core properties consist of two distribution service facilities  one office building and one retail property all of which are located outside of the northeast region of the united states 
the company intends to sell its non core properties as opportunities become available 
the company s ability to generate cash from asset sales is dependent upon market conditions and will necessarily be limited if market conditions make such sales unattractive 
there were no sales of non core properties during fiscal at october   the four non core properties have a net book value of approximately million 
funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo to be an additional measure of an equity reit s operating performance 
the company reports ffo in addition to its net income applicable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities 
management has adopted the definition suggested by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit and defines ffo to mean net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
management considers ffo a meaningful  additional measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of its real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing the performance of the company 
it is helpful as it excludes various items included in net income that are not indicative of the company s operating performance  such as gains or losses from sales of property and depreciation and amortization 
however  ffo does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance 
ffo as defined by us  may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported by other real estate investment trusts due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 
the table below provides a reconciliation of net income in accordance with gaap to ffo for each of the three years in the period ended october  amounts in thousands 
year ended october  net income applicable to common and class a common stockholders    plus real property depreciation    amortization of tenant improvements and allowances    amortization of deferred leasing costs funds from operations applicable to common and class a common stockholders    net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    ffo increased by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase is attributable to an increase in net income from continuing operations resulting from an increase in overall property operating income and recent property acquisitions

at october   the company s core properties were leased  an increase of approximately since the beginning of the year 
the company s non core office building property in southfield  michigan was approximately vacant at october  the office leasing market in this region of the country continues to be weak and the company is aggressively marketing the vacant space 
a tenant who currently leases  sf of space in the building is not expected to renew its lease upon expiration in december the company s single largest real estate investment is its ownership interest in ridgeway shopping center a consolidated joint venture located in stamford  connecticut 
ridgeway s revenues represented approximately or million of total consolidated revenues in fiscal compared to or million in fiscal the property was leased at october  lease termination income of  in fiscal consists of a lease cancellation payment of  from a tenant who terminated during the year and a payment of  received in settlement of a bankruptcy action of a former tenant

fiscal vs 
fiscal revenues base rents and recoveries from tenants increased to million and million or and  respectively  in fiscal from million and million in fiscal the increase in base rents and recoveries resulted primarily from i the acquisition of four properties in fiscal containing  square feet of leasable space  providing revenues of million in the year  ii the full year impact related to two operating properties acquired in  providing incremental revenue of million in fiscal  iii an increase in recoveries of property operating expenses and property taxes from tenants of  in fiscal and iv an overall increase in the leasing levels at the company s properties

inflation the company s long term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on its operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling the company to receive a scheduled base rent increases and b percentage rents based upon tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise 
in addition  many of the company s non anchor leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits the company to seek increases in rents upon renewal at then current market rates if rents provided in the expiring leases are below then existing market rates 
most of the company s leases require tenants to pay a share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
environmental matters based upon management s ongoing review of its properties  management is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of the company s properties which would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that a the discovery of environmental conditions  which were previously unknown  b changes in law  c the conduct of tenants or d activities relating to properties in the vicinity of the company s properties  will not expose the company to material liability in the future 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of the company s tenants  which would adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations
