the reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies  practices and estimates as described below 
we believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly  in all material respects  the financial position and results of operations for the company 
financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period 
actual amounts could differ from the amounts estimated 
differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and there is evidence of an agreement and collectability of consideration to be received is reasonably assured  all of which generally occur at the time of shipment 
sales are recorded net of sales returns and allowances 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue and costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
amounts related to raw materials provided by customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales 

table of contents critical accounting policies continued accounts receivable management estimates allowances for collectability related to its accounts receivable balances 
these allowances are based on the customer relationships  the aging and turns of accounts receivable  credit worthiness of customers  credit concentrations and payment history 
management s estimates include providing for percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectable 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age  applying historical trend rates to the most recent months sales  less actual write offs to date 
although management monitors collections and credit worthiness  the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectability of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing 
management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectability of its receivables or future revenues 
management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits  and applies these trend rates to the most recent months sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation 
the company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization 
a large portion of the company s inventory is saleable to multiple customers and a portion of the inventory is manufactured to specifications provided by original equipment manufacturers and is not subject to rapid technological change 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
in order to calculate goodwill  management applies judgment in determining the reporting units  which represent distinct parts of the business 
the annual goodwill impairment analysis involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss 
calculating the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant estimates and long term assumptions 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or any changes in market conditions  interest rates or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge 
management has continued to review the carrying values of goodwill for recoverability based on fair market value estimated using estimated future cash flows and prices of comparable companies in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the fair value of the reporting units was estimated using a combination of valuation techniques  including the expected present value of future cash flows and prices of comparable businesses 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment for disposal of long lived assets  the company evaluates the recoverability of the recorded amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we determine fair value using discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques 
additional information on the company s accounting policies is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report as referenced to the appendix to this report 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the revised sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
generally  compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued using an option pricing model 
in addition  liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period 
compensation cost will be recognized over the requisite service period  generally as the award vests 
the company is required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year 
sfas r applies to all awards granted after october  and to previously granted awards unvested as of the adoption date 
the effect of adoption of sfas r is currently estimated to be approximately  to  approximately per share after tax for however  our actual share based compensation expense in depends on a number of factors  including fair value of awards at the time of grant 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards continued in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
sfas requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage be recognized as current period charges 
further  sfas requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overheads must be recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the company believes that the effect of sfas on its financial statements and related disclosures is immaterial 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in august  the company entered into an interest rate swap contract as a cash flow hedge under which the interest rate on its term debt under the then existing credit facility was fixed at  plus a profit spread for the lender 
prior to entering into the swap agreement  management had reviewed the year history of interest rates and had determined that the company s risk of liability resulting from a material decline in interest rates over the life of the swap below the fixed level under the swap was not significant 
in may  the company paid  to cancel the swap  as there was no longer any outstanding term debt 
because of the level of variable interest rate debt in the company s capital structure  the company is exposed to earnings or cash flow fluctuations due to changes in interest rates 
at september   the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
this debt exposes the company to changes in interest expense brought about by changes in interest rates 
if the weighted average interest rate were to increase by for fiscal  the impact on net income would be immaterial 
foreign currency exchange risk the company had no transactions in foreign currencies  nor had it entered into any foreign currency futures contracts as of september  commodity price risk the company had not entered into any forward buying agreements for the raw materials it uses to produce its goods and services as of september  an assessment of the risks of short term commodity price fluctuations is set forth in part i  item of this form k under the caption raw materials and suppliers
