on june   our board of directors approved a change in fiscal year end from january to june  effective as of june  the change was implemented to better reflect our business cycle and to enhance business planning relative to our customers retail calendars 
as a result  the financial periods presented and discussed will be as follows i year ended june  represents the twelve months ended june   ii five month transition period represents the five months ended june   iii year ended january  represents the twelve months ended january   and iv year ended january  represents the twelve months ended january  overview we are a global prestige beauty products company 
we sell our fragrance  skin care and color cosmetic products to retailers in the united states in department stores and mass retailers  as well as internationally in prestige department stores  perfumeries  boutiques and travel retail locations 
we have established ourselves as a source of over fragrance  skin care and cosmetic brands through brand ownership  brand licensing and distribution arrangements 
in addition to the approximately prestige brands we own and license  we also distribute over additional prestige fragrance brands principally to mass retailers in the united states 
our portfolio of owned and licensed fragrance brands includes the following elizabeth arden red door  red door revealed  elizabeth arden th avenue  th avenue after five  elizabeth arden green tea  elizabeth arden provocative woman  ardenbeauty  and sunflowers  curious britney spears and fantasy britney spears  elizabeth taylor s white diamonds  passion  forever elizabeth and gardenia  white shoulders  halston and z  geoffrey beene s grey flannel  ps fine cologne for men  design  gant adventure  and wings 
our skin care brands include ceramide  eight hour cream  overnight success and prevage  and our cosmetics products include color intrigue cheek eye collection and other elizabeth arden brand lipstick  foundation and other color cosmetics products 
our business strategy to increase sales and earnings is based on a growing the sales of our existing brand portfolio through new product launches and increased advertising and marketing activities  b acquiring control of additional prestige brands through licensing opportunities and acquisitions  c expanding the offering of prestige fragrance products that we distribute on behalf of other beauty companies  d growing the prestige fragrance category with our mass retail customers through new fragrance and skin care brands  marketing and innovative programs  e pursuing opportunities to improve working capital efficiencies  and f developing our focus on emerging markets 
we manage our business by evaluating net sales  ebitda as defined in note under item selected financial data and working capital utilization including through the levels of inventory and accounts receivable and borrowings under our credit facility 
we encounter a variety of challenges that may affect our business and should be considered along with the information presented in the section forward looking information and factors that may affect future results 
these factors include the absence of contracts with our key customers and suppliers  changes in customer demands and preferences for prestige beauty products  in general  and for prestige fragrances  in particular  as approximately of our net sales are of prestige fragrances  the risks of international operations including the impact of foreign currency rates  the retail performance of our retail customers and their commitment to the prestige fragrance and beauty category and their execution of that category  competition  the efficient operation of our worldwide organization and our level of indebtedness 
the refinancing of our high cost senior notes completed in february resulted in a million reduction in interest expense in the year ended june  compared to the year ended logo 
table of contents january  as a result of our improved operating performance in the years ended january  and  the equity financing in october and the debt refinancing  both of which improved our balance sheet  our corporate credit rating was upgraded to ba and b from b and b by the credit agencies moody s investors service and standard poor s  respectively 
as a result of the consolidation of our us distribution and warehouse operations to our newly expanded facility in roanoke  virginia in the year ended january  and the conversion of all primary order processing systems to a common platform during the five month transition period ended june   we realized savings of approximately million in the twelve months ended january   compared to the year ended january  in addition  as our revenues grow  we expect to derive operating leverage resulting from our fixed cost infrastructure 
in the year ended june   net sales increased compared to the year ended january  as a result of the launch of the britney spears fragrance  curious  sales of the elizabeth arden provocative woman fragrance  the favorable impact of foreign currency rates  which represents of the increase  increased skin care product sales globally and increased cosmetic product sales internationally 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during the year ended june  compared to the year ended january  as a result of additional advertising expenditures to support brand growth  including new product launches  and higher development costs  increased selling costs and the impact of foreign currency rates 
in the year ended june   we increased our expenditures for advertising and promotional activities by utilizing a portion of the savings in interest expense associated with the debt refinancing activities that occurred during the year ended january  and the five month transition period ended june  our fixed cost infrastructure provides operating leverage as our revenues grow 
net income increased by million during the year ended june  compared to the year ended january   primarily as a result of lower interest expense and the debt extinguishment charges associated with the redemption of senior notes in the year ended january  in addition  net income attributable to common shareholders increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended january  due to the items discussed above and an million charge related to the accelerated accretion on the series d convertible preferred stock which was converted into common stock sold by an affiliate of unilever in our equity offering in october we incurred an additional million charge for accelerated accretion on the series d convertible preferred stock which was converted into common stock by the unilever affiliate in the five month transition period ended june  critical accounting policies and estimates we consider the following accounting policies important in understanding our operating results and financial condition 
for additional policies  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements general information and summary of significant accounting policies for the application of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for acquisitions and intangible assets 
we have accounted for our acquisitions  including the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
under the purchase method of accounting  the cost  including transaction costs  are allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income 
for example  different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ the useful life of property  plant  and equipment acquired will differ substantially from the useful life of brand licenses and trademarks 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  net income in a given period may be higher 
logo 
table of contents determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
one of the areas that require more judgment is determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets 
to assist in this process  we often obtain appraisals from independent valuation firms for certain intangible assets 
our intangible assets generally consist of exclusive brand licenses and trademarks 
we do not carry any goodwill 
the value of our intangible assets  including brand licenses  trademarks and intangibles  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we periodically review intangible assets  at least annually or more often as circumstances dictate  for impairment and the useful life assigned using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
we have determined that the elizabeth arden trademarks acquired in the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business have indefinite useful lives as cash flows from the use of the trademarks are expected to be generated indefinitely 
in april  we completed our annual impairment testing of these assets with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
the analysis and assessments of these assets indicated that no impairment adjustment was required 
long lived assets 
we review for impairment long lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
during the year ended june   we recognized an impairment charge of million associated with the anticipated sale of our corporate headquarters in miami lakes  florida 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances 
the provision for sales returns represents management s estimate of future returns based on historical experience and considering current external factors and market conditions 
allowances for sales returns and markdowns 
as is customary in the prestige beauty business  we grant certain of our customers  subject to our authorization and approval  the right to either return product or to receive a markdown allowance for certain promotional product 
upon sale  we record a provision for product returns and markdowns estimated based on our historical and projected experience  economic trends and changes in customer demand 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the allowance for returns and markdowns  and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including an analysis of receivables aging and a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if  for example  the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
provisions for inventory obsolescence 
we record a provision for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  forecasted demand  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
if there are changes to these estimates  additional provisions for inventory obsolescence may be necessary 
hedge contracts 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  sfas  we designated each foreign currency contract entered into as of june   as a cash flow hedge 
logo 
table of contents unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  associated with these contracts are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
gains and losses will only be recognized in earnings in the period in which the contracts expire 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income for employee and director option grants  as such grants had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the pro forma effect on net income loss and diluted earnings loss per common share for the year ended june   five month transition period ended june  and years ended january  and is set forth in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements general information and summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas r  a standard on accounting for share based payments that requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards 
under sfas r  share based payment awards result in a cost that will be measured at fair value on the grant date of the awards  based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
compensation cost for awards that vest would not be reversed if the awards expire without being exercised 
sfas r will be effective for us beginning in the three month period ending september  we are planning on adopting the modified prospective approach as our implementation method under this pronouncement 
for the year ended june   the company is estimating it will record costs related to this pronouncement of approximately million million net of taxes or per diluted share 
restricted stock awards 
restricted stock awards are recorded as unearned deferred compensation in shareholders equity when granted and are amortized over their pre defined vesting period 
for a discussion of the different types of restricted stock awards and the accounting treatment of each award  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements performance accelerated and other restricted common stock 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing a potential valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged or credited to net income in the period of such determination

seasonality our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in the first half of the fiscal year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season 
in the year ended june   approximately of our net sales were made during the first half of the fiscal year 
due to the size and timing of certain orders from our customers  sales  results of operations  working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between quarters of the same and different years 
as a result  we expect to experience variability in net sales  net income  working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis 
increased sales of skin care and cosmetic products relative to fragrances can reduce the seasonality of our business 
we experience seasonality in our working capital  with peak inventory levels from july to october and peak receivable balances from september to december 
our working capital borrowings are also seasonal and are normally highest in the months of september  october and november

table of contents in february  we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert the fixed interest rate on million or approximately of our outstanding senior subordinated notes to a variable interest rate based on libor 
the swap agreement matures in february we can terminate the swap at our option at any time and the counter party can call the swap any time after january we designated the swap as a fair value hedge 
future liquidity and capital needs 
our principal future uses of funds are for debt service  working capital requirements  capital expenditures and additional brand acquisitions including brand licenses and their associated product launches or product distribution arrangements 
we have historically financed  and we expect to continue to finance  our needs primarily through internally generated funds  our credit facility and external financing 
we collect cash from our customers based on our sales to them and their respective payment terms 
we have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks  of which jp morgan chase bank is the administrative agent  which provides for borrowings on a revolving basis of up to million with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
we entered into an amendment to the credit facility effective september  that extended the maturity of the credit facility to june from january  reduced the interest rates and commitment fees based on our debt service coverage ratio and enhanced the inventory component of the borrowing base 
the credit facility is guaranteed by all of our us subsidiaries 
borrowings under the credit facility are limited to of eligible accounts receivable and from november through may of eligible finished goods inventory and are collateralized by a first priority lien on all of our us accounts receivable and inventory 
our obligations under the credit facility rank pari passu  or equal in right of payment  with our remaining senior secured notes due and rank senior to our senior subordinated notes due the credit facility has only one financial maintenance covenant  which is a debt service coverage ratio that must be maintained at not less than to if average borrowing availability declines to less than million million from november through may 
no financial maintenance covenant was applicable for any fiscal quarter during the year ended june  the credit facility restricts us from incurring additional non trade indebtedness other than refinancing and certain small amounts of other indebtedness and limits the payment of dividends on our common stock to million over the term of the credit facility  repurchases of common stock and other distributions to common shareholders 
in addition  the indenture pursuant to which our senior subordinated notes are issued restricts the incurrence of debt other than refinancing indebtedness and certain other indebtedness and the payment of dividends subject to satisfaction of a fixed charge coverage ratio and net income tests 
borrowings under the revolving credit portion of the credit facility bear interest at a floating rate based on the applicable margin  which is determined by reference to a specific financial ratio 
at our option  the applicable margin may be applied to either the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate 
the applicable margin is determined by reference to a debt service coverage ratio 
as a result of the september amendment to the credit facility  the applicable margin charged on libor loans and prime rate loans were reduced to a range of to from a range of to for libor loans  and to a range of to 
from a range of to for prime rate borrowings 
as of june   the applicable margin was for libor loans and for prime rate loans 
the commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility ranges from to per year

based upon our internal projections  we believe that the credit facility  as currently amended and restated  provides sufficient flexibility so that we will remain in compliance with its terms 
if our actual results deviate significantly from our projections  however  we may not remain in compliance with the debt service covenant and would not be allowed to borrow under the credit facility 
in addition  a default under our credit facility that causes acceleration of the debt under this facility could trigger a default on our senior notes 
in the event we are not able to borrow under our credit logo 
table of contents facility  we would be required to develop an alternative source of liquidity 
there is no assurance that we could obtain replacement financing or what the terms of such financing  if available  would be 
as of june   we had approximately million in outstanding borrowings and approximately million in outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility  compared with approximately million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at june  as of june   we had approximately million of eligible receivables and inventories available as collateral under the credit facility 
therefore  we had availability of approximately million 
we classify the credit facility as short term debt on our balance sheet since we expect to reduce outstanding borrowings during the second and third quarters october through march of our fiscal year 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to cover debt service  working capital requirements and capital expenditures for the next twelve months other than additional working capital requirements that may result from further expansion of our operations through acquisitions of additional brands  new licensing agreements or new product distribution arrangements 
we have discussions from time to time with manufacturers of prestige fragrance brands and with distributors that hold exclusive distribution rights regarding our possible acquisition of additional exclusive manufacturing and or distribution rights 
we currently have no agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition  although we periodically execute routine agreements to maintain the confidentiality of information obtained during the course of discussions with manufacturers and distributors 
there is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate successfully for any such future acquisitions or that we will be able to obtain acquisition financing or additional working capital financing on satisfactory terms for further expansion of our operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of june   we had million in borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
borrowings under our credit facility are seasonal  with peak borrowings in the months of september  october and november 
borrowings under the credit facility are subject to variable rates and  accordingly  our earnings and cash flow will be affected by changes in interest rates 
based upon our june  average borrowings under our credit facility  and assuming there had been a two percentage point change in the average interest rate for these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense for the year ended june  would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
in february  we entered into two interest rate swap transactions to swap million of our fixed rate senior subordinated notes due to a floating rate of interest based on libor to better balance our mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
in the short term  this will provide us with a lower level of interest expense related to a portion of the senior subordinated notes based on current libor rates  however  over the life of the notes  interest expense may be greater than based upon fluctuations in libor 
for example  if libor interest rates on the million of floating interest rate debt increased by over the year end libor rate  then it is estimated that our interest expense would have increased by approximately  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  our results could be negatively affected 
we can terminate the swap at our option at any time and the counter party can call the swap any time after january we designated the swap as a fair value hedge 
foreign currency risk we sell our products in approximately countries around the world 
during the year ended june   we derived approximately of our net sales from our international operations 
we conduct our international operations in a variety of different countries and derive our sales in currencies including the euro  british pound  swiss franc  canadian dollar and australian dollar  as well as the us dollar 
our operations may be subject to volatility because of currency changes  inflation changes and changes in political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
with respect to international operations  our sales and expenses are typically denominated in local currency  while costs of goods sold are denominated in a combination of local currency and the us dollar 
our results of operations are reported in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency rates can affect our reported sales  margins  operating costs and the anticipated settlement of our foreign denominated receivables and payables 
a weakening of the foreign currencies in which we generate sales relative to the currencies in which our costs are denominated  which is primarily the us dollar  may decrease our reported cash flow and operating profits 
our competitors may or may not be subject to the same fluctuations in currency rates  and our competitive position could be affected by these changes 
as of june   our subsidiaries outside the united states held approximately of our total assets 
the cumulative effect of translating balance sheet accounts from the functional currency into the us dollar at current exchange rates is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of june   we had notional amounts of approximately million euros and approximately million british pounds under foreign currency contracts that expire between july  and june  to reduce the exposure of our foreign subsidiary revenues to fluctuations in currency rates 
we have designated each foreign currency option contract as a cash flow hedge 
based on notional amounts of million euros and million british pounds and an increase in the euro to dollar and british pound to dollar exchange rates on hedging contracts that mature  we would have unrealized gains of approximately million euros and approximately  british pounds 
at june   the unrealized gain  net of taxes associated with these contracts of approximately million is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the unrealized gain  net of taxes  incurred during the year ended june  was approximately million 
we intend to only enter into foreign currency contracts that qualify for hedge accounting and  therefore  the gains and losses will only be recognized in earnings in the period in which the contracts expire 
we do not utilize foreign exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
there can be no assurance that our hedging operations  if any  will eliminate or substantially reduce risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates
