item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors that may affect future results if we are unable to retain current and attract new customers to our value city business segment  our results of operations  financial condition and business could be adversely affected 
our ability to execute to our new management s strategy for the value city segment is necessary to reverse the downward sales trend we have experienced 
this strategy includes acquiring the right mix of merchandise in our key fashion areas of ladies and mens  of acquiring in season merchandise sooner in the season in complete runs size and color in recognizable brands and of identifying the prevailing fashion trend 
our advertising and marketing efforts to retain and draw new customers will need to be focused on this strategy 
the failure to impact the customers we have and draw in new customers may result in stores being unprofitable  which could  in turn  have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to open all the dsw and filene s basement stores contemplated by our growth strategy on a timely basis  and new stores we open may not be profitable or may have an adverse impact on the profitability of existing stores  any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we intend to open approximately and stores per year in the four years from through for filene s basement and dsw  respectively 
however  we may not achieve our planned expansion on a timely and profitable basis or that we will be able to achieve results similar to those achieved in existing locations in prior periods 
our ability to open and operate new dsw and filene s basement stores successfully on a timely and profitable basis depends on many factors  including  among others  our ability to identify suitable markets and sites for new store locations  negotiate favorable lease terms  build out or refurbish sites on a timely and effective basis  obtain sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of new stores  obtain sufficient financing and capital resources or generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund growth  successfully open new dsw and filene s basement stores in regions of the united states in which we currently have few or no stores  open new stores at costs not significantly greater than those anticipated  control the costs of other capital investments associated with store openings  including  for example  those related to the expansion of distribution facilities  hire  train and retain qualified managers and store personnel  and successfully integrate new stores into our existing infrastructure  operations and management and distribution systems or adapt such infrastructure  operations and systems to accommodate our growth 
as a result  we may be unable to open new stores at the rates expected or at all 
if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy  the opening of new stores could be delayed or prevented  could cost more than anticipated and could divert resources 
table of contents from other areas of our business  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that we open new stores in our existing markets  we may experience reduced net sales in existing stores in those markets 
as the number of our stores increases  our stores will become more concentrated in the markets we serve 
as a result  the number of customers and financial performance of individual stores may decline and the average sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on our good relationships with vendors to purchase brand name and designer merchandise at favorable prices 
if these relationships were to be impaired  we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection of merchandise at attractive prices  and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing fashion trends  either of which could have a negative impact on our competitive position  our business and financial performance 
we do not have long term supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with any vendors except for greeting cards and bottled drinks and  therefore  our success depends on maintaining good relations with our vendors in all business segments 
since our business is fundamentally dependent on selling brand name and designer merchandise at attractive prices  we must continue to obtain from our vendors a wide selection of this merchandise at favorable wholesale prices 
our growth strategy depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply us with sufficient inventory to stock our new stores 
if we fail to continue to deepen and strengthen our relations with our existing vendors to improve the quality of merchandise they supply us and fail to acquire new vendors of in season brand name and designer merchandise  we may limit our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise at favorable prices  which could have a negative impact on our competitive position 
we may be unable to anticipate and respond to fashion trends and consumer preferences in the markets in which we operate  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our merchandising strategy is based on identifying each region s customer base and having the proper mix of products in each store to attract its target customers 
this requires us to anticipate and respond to numerous and fluctuating variables in fashion trends and other conditions in the markets in which our stores are situated 
a variety of factors will affect our ability to maintain the proper mix of products in each store  including variations in local economic conditions  which could affect our customers discretionary spending  unanticipated fashion trends  our success in developing and maintaining vendor relationships that provide us access to in season merchandise at attractive prices  our success in distributing merchandise to our stores in an efficient manner  and changes in weather patterns  which in turn affect consumer preferences 
if we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of each region  we may experience decreases in our net sales and may be forced to increase markdowns in relation to slow moving merchandise  either of which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
seasonal variability of operations 
our operations have been historically seasonal  with a disproportionate amount of sales and a majority of net income occurring in the fall and christmas selling seasons for value city and filene s basement 
dsw net sales have typically been higher in spring and early fall 
as a result of seasonality  any factors negatively affecting us during these periods  including adverse weather  the timing and level of markdowns or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year 
our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons in addition to seasonal factors  which could result in a decline in the price of our common shares 
our business is sensitive to customers spending patterns  which in turn are subject to prevailing regional and national economic conditions and the general level of economic activity 
our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past  and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future 
in addition to seasonal fluctuations  including weather patterns  a variety of other factors affect our comparable store sales and quarterly financial performance  including 
table of contents changes in our merchandising strategy  timing and concentration of new store openings and related pre opening and other start up costs  levels of pre opening expenses associated with new stores  changes in our merchandise mix  changes in and regional variations in demographic and population characteristics  timing of promotional events  actions by our competitors  and general united states economic conditions and  in particular  the retail sales environment 
accordingly  our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter  and comparable store sales for any particular future period may decrease 
in the future  our financial performance may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common shares could decline 
our stock price may fluctuate significantly  which could negatively affect the trading of our common shares 
the market price of our common shares has fluctuated significantly in the past and may likely continue to fluctuate in the future 
various factors and events have caused this fluctuation and are likely to cause the fluctuations to continue 
these factors include  among others developments related to the proposed dsw ipo  quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results  changes by securities analysts in estimates regarding retail ventures  conditions in the retail industry  the condition of the stock market  and general economic conditions 
our failure to retain our existing senior management team and to continue to attract qualified new personnel could adversely affect our business 
our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization to ensure that we continually have sufficient inventories of assorted brand name merchandise at below traditional retail prices 
this execution requires an experienced and talented management team 
if we were to lose the benefit of the experience  efforts and abilities of any of our key executive and buying personnel  our business could be adversely affected 
we have entered into employment agreements with certain of these officers 
furthermore  our ability to manage our retail expansion will require us to continue to train  motivate and manage our employees and to attract  motivate and retain additional qualified managerial and merchandising personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate profitably 
we may be unable to compete favorably in our highly competitive markets 
the off price retail  department store and retail footwear markets are highly competitive with few barriers to entry 
we compete against a diverse group of retailers  both small and large  including locally owned  regional and national department stores  specialty retailers  discount chains and off price retailers 
some of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do 
our success depends on our ability to remain competitive with respect to style  price  brand availability and customer service 
the performance of our competitors  as well as a change in their pricing policies  marketing activities and other business strategies  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our market share 

table of contents a decline in general economic conditions  or the outbreak or escalation of war or terrorist acts  could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise 
consumer spending habits  including spending for the merchandise that we sell  are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  prevailing interest rates  income tax rates and policies  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
in addition  consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers disposable income 
a general slowdown in the us economy or an uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect consumer spending habits 
consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation 
the outbreak or escalation of war  or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the united states  could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers 
in the event of an economic slowdown  we could experience lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis and be forced to delay or slow our retail expansion plans 
we rely on foreign sources for our merchandise  and our business is therefore subject to risks associated with international trade 
we purchase merchandise from domestic and foreign vendors 
in addition  many of our domestic vendors import a large portion of their merchandise from abroad 
for this reason  we face risks inherent in purchasing from foreign suppliers  such as economic and political instability in countries where these suppliers are located  international hostilities or acts of war or terrorism affecting the united states or foreign countries from which our merchandise is sourced  increases in shipping costs  transportation delays and interruptions  including as a result of increased inspections of import shipments by domestic authorities  work stoppages  adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates  laws of the united states affecting the importation of goods  including duties  tariffs and quotas and other non tariff barriers  expropriation or nationalization  changes in local government administration and governmental policies  changes in import duties or quotas  compliance with trade and foreign tax laws  and local business practices  including compliance with local laws and with domestic and international labor standards 
we require our vendors to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our internal requirements 
however  we do not control our vendors or their labor and business practices 
the violation of labor or other laws by one of our vendors could have an adverse effect on our business 
we face significant security risks related to our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information 
on march   we announced the theft of credit card and other purchase information of dsw customers  which could affect our reputation and business and subject us to liability 
we rely on commercially available encryption software and other technologies to provide security for processing and transmission on confidential customer information  such as credit card numbers 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments  including improper acts by third parties  may result in a compromise or breach of the security measures we use to protect customer transaction data 
compromises of these security systems could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business  and we may be subject to liabilities and reporting obligations 
a party who is able to 
table of contents circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our information  cause interruptions in our operations  damage our reputation and customers willingness to shop in our stores and subject us to possible liability 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
in march  we announced that we had learned of the theft of credit card and other purchase information relating to customers who made purchases at dsw stores during mid december of to mid february of we now believe that the theft occurred at dsw stores 
we cannot yet reasonably estimate what the potential liability to us in connection with these events is  and we do not yet know what effect this incident may have on dsw customers perception of us 
the proposed ipo of dsw may not be completed 
if the ipo is not completed  net proceeds which we would have received from the ipo will not be available to repay indebtedness  including indebtedness to related parties 
additionally  we will have incurred expenses to date in connection with the ipo for which we will not receive any benefits 
the ipo may not be completed 
we have anticipated that a portion of the net proceeds of the ipo will be used to repay million of intercompany indebtedness owed by dsw to retail ventures 
it is anticipated that retail ventures will then apply the amount received from dsw to the partial payment of obligations evidenced by a million promissory note made by retail ventures payable to its subsidiary  value city  issued in december it is anticipated that value city will then apply a portion of the amount received from retail ventures to the payment in full of all outstanding indebtedness and obligations owed by value city and other affiliates of retail ventures under a million term loan agreement with related parties 
this million term loan has an annual effective rate of interest of  and matures in june the remaining portion of the proceeds of any such million repayment is to be used i first  to repay subject to the ability to reborrow a portion of the obligations outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and ii second  to the extent of any excess  for working capital and general corporate purposes 
if the ipo is not completed  we may be unable to prepay our obligations under the term loan agreement  and a significant portion of our cash flow from operations will continue to be dedicated to the payment of interest on the term loan  and will not be available for other purposes 
in addition  if the ipo is not completed  we will have incurred significant expenses in connection with the ipo which we will be unable to recoup  and for which we will not receive any benefits 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization  recoverability of long lived assets including intangible assets  the calculation of retirement benefits  estimates for self insurance reserves for health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance  income taxes  contingencies  litigation and revenue recognition 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  and in some cases  actuarial and appraisal techniques 
we constantly re evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
while we believe that our historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate 
as the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment  actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe the following represent the most critical estimates and assumptions  among others  used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the selection  application and disclosure of the critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
revenue recognition 
revenues from merchandise sales are recognized at the point of sale and are net of returns and exclude sales tax 
revenue from gift cards is deferred and is recognized upon redemption of the gift cards 
layaway sales are recognized when the merchandise has been paid for in full 
cost of sales and merchandise inventories 
we use the retail method of accounting for substantially all of our merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out basis  or market  using the retail inventory method 
the retail method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross 
table of contents margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on our consolidated balance sheet is decreased by charges to cost of sales at the time the retail value of the inventory is lowered through the use of markdowns 
hence  earnings are negatively impacted as merchandise is marked down prior to sale 
reserves to value inventory at the lower of cost or market were million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
inherent in the calculation of inventories are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  setting the original merchandise retail value or markon  markups of initial prices established  reduction of pricing due to customer s value perception or perceived value  known as markdowns  and estimates of losses between physical inventory counts or shrinkage  which  combined with the averaging process within the retail method  can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost and the resulting gross margins 
asset impairments and long lived assets 
we must periodically evaluate the carrying amount of our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  and finite life intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review to ascertain if any assets have been impaired 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest from the asset 
our reviews are conducted down at the lowest identifiable level  which include a store 
the impairment loss recognized is the excess of the carrying value  based on discounted future cash flows  of the asset over its fair value 
should an impairment loss be realized  it will be included in operating expenses 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we recorded million including the impairment of a capital lease of million related to a store closing  million and million in charges  respectively  related to long lived assets at store operating units 
during fiscal we recorded a non cash charge of million  million net of taxes  for the impairment of goodwill related to filene s basement 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge as a result of the implementation of sfas  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized 
the initial tests for goodwill impairment  as of february   resulted in a non cash charge of million  million net of taxes  which is reported in our consolidated statement of operations as of february  in the caption cumulative effect of accounting change 
substantially all of the charge relates to goodwill associated with our purchase of mazel s interest in vcm and is included in the net loss for the year ended february  the balance of goodwill subject to goodwill annual testing at the end of the current fiscal year was million on the dsw segment 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from our current estimates 
self insurance reserves 
we record estimates for certain health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance costs that are self insured programs 
these estimates are based on actuarial assumptions and are subject to change based on actual results 
should costs of certain health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and to the extent actual results vary from assumptions  earnings would be impacted 
pension 
the obligations and related assets of defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements page f of this annual report 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate  the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the yield on fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at january   the weighted average actuarial assumption of our plans was discount rate  assumed salary increases and long term rate of return on plan assets 
to the extent actual results vary from assumptions  earnings would be impacted 
customer loyalty program 
we maintain a customer loyalty program for our dsw stores in which customers receive a future discount on qualifying purchases 
the reward your style program is designed to promote customer awareness and loyalty plus provide the company with the ability to communicate with our customers and enhance our understanding of their spending trends 
while the program develops customer loyalty  it also provides 
table of contents dsw with valuable market intelligence and purchasing information regarding its most frequent customers 
upon reaching the target level  customers may redeem these discounts on a future purchase 
generally  these future discounts must be redeemed within six months 
we accrue the estimated costs of the anticipated redemptions of the discount earned at the time of the initial purchase and charge such costs to selling  general and administrative expense based on historical experience 
the estimates of the costs associated with the loyalty program require us to make assumptions related to customer purchase levels and redemption rates 
the accrued liability as of january  and january  was million and million  respectively 
to the extent assumptions of purchases and redemption rates vary from actual results  earnings would be impacted 
during the third quarter of  filene s basement implemented a limited time customer rewards program that ended in december the rewards program provided qualifying customers with filene s basement gift cards in various denominations based on their cumulative spending during the program period 
filene s basement had an accrued liability related to the rewards program of million at january  filene s basement plans to utilize this customer database for direct mail and e mail marketing efforts during fiscal income taxes 
we are required to determine the aggregate amount of income tax expense to accrue and the amount which will be currently payable based upon tax statutes of each jurisdiction we do business in 
in making these estimates  we adjust income based on a determination of generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities  as a result of these differences  are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences that will reverse in subsequent years 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if our management had made these determinations on a different basis  our tax expense  assets and liabilities could be different 
during fiscal  we established a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets of million for carry forwards related to state net operating losses 
during fiscal  we established a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets of million for charitable contribution carry forwards 
results of operations we operate three business operating segments 
value city and filene s basement segments operate full line  off price department stores 
our dsw segment sells better branded off price shoes and accessories

filene s basement had a net increase of five stores during fiscal and had a comparable store sale increase of 
merchandise categories of mens  ladies and childrens had comparable store sale increases of  and  respectively

due to the increase in up front purchasing and packaways filene s basement remained in stock starting in and during both the spring and fall season in fiscal in addition  filene s basement allocated more space to the childrens areas in the stores to support the increased sales in this category 
gross profit 
consolidated gross profit increased million from  million to  million  and increased as a percentage of net sales from to 
value city s gross profit decrease is primarily attributable to increased markdowns necessary to address aged inventory and to accelerate the sale of underperforming fall merchandise 
higher initial markups as a result of increased average unit retail prices did not offset the increased markdowns associated with the clearance promotions 
gross profit for our dsw segment improved as a result of increased average unit retail  lower costs associated with increased orders and reduced markdowns due to sales increases 
filene s basement segment s gross profit improved as the result of higher initial markups on merchandise purchases and a reduction in markdowns 
higher initial markups were the result of increased average unit retail price increases as measured by transactions through the point of sale registers 
gross profit  as a percent of sales by segment  was value city department stores dsw filene s basement total sg a

new store openings in the period were limited to our dsw and filene s basement segments 
preparations for opening a dsw store generally takes to weeks while a typical filene s basement store generally takes to weeks including construction and setup 
pre opening costs are expensed as incurred 
it has been our experience that new stores for each of our segments generally achieve profitability and contribute to net income after the first full year of operations 
pre opening expense for the new dsw stores was million in fiscal compared to million for the new stores opened in the prior year 
pre opening expense was million for five new filene s basement stores in fiscal compared to million in fiscal for the one new filene s basement store opened in the prior year

seasonality our business is affected by the pattern of seasonality common to most retail businesses 
historically  the majority of our sales and operating profit have been generated during the back to school and christmas selling seasons for our value city segment and  more recently  our filene s basement segment 
dsw net sales have typically been higher in spring and early fall  when dsw s customers interest in new seasonal styles increases 
fiscal year we follow a week fiscal year that ends on the saturday nearest to january fiscal  and each contain weeks 
income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the effective tax benefits are negatively impacted due to the write off of net operating losses of million as the result of the reorganization of the company 
during fiscal and fiscal  we established a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
the reserve reflects a reduction in the estimated amount for future tax deductions  primarily for state and local taxes and excess contribution carry forwards 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was versus for fiscal there was an increase in the effective tax rate primarily due to the increase in non deductible expenses for tax purposes and the fluctuation in taxable income 
however  that increase was then off set by the tax effect of the write off of financing costs 
adoption of accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb periodically issues statements of financial accounting standards sfas  some of which require implementation by a date falling within or after the close of the fiscal year 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires the consolidation of certain entities considered to be variable interest entities vies 
an entity is considered to be a vie when it has equity investors who lack the characteristics of having a controlling financial interest  or its capital is insufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
consolidation of a vie by an investor is required when it is determined that the investor will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or residual returns if they occur 
fin provides certain exceptions to these rules  relating to qualifying special purpose entities qspe s subject to the requirements of sfas no 
upon its original issuance  fin required that vies created after january  would be consolidated immediately  while vies created prior to february  were to be consolidated as of july  in october  the fasb deferred the effective date for consolidation of vies created prior to february  to december  for calendar year end companies  with earlier application encouraged 
in december  the fasb published a revision to fin fin r to clarify some of the provisions of the original interpretation and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
fin r provides special effective date provisions to enterprises that fully or partially applied to fin prior to the issuance of the revised interpretation

table of contents achievement of expected cash flows from operations and compliance with the restrictive covenants of our credit agreements see note to the consolidated financial statements are dependent upon a number of factors  including the attainment of sales  gross profit  expense levels  vendor relations  and flow of merchandise that are consistent with our financial projections 
future limitations of credit availability by factor organizations and or vendors will restrict our ability to obtain merchandise and services and may impair operating results 
although operating results for fiscal were negative  we believe that cash generated by operations  along with the available proceeds from our credit agreements and other sources of financing  will be sufficient to meet our obligations for working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to meet our projections 
further  there is no assurance that extended financing will be available in the future if we fail to meet our projections or on terms acceptable to us

these swap agreements  which would be designated as cash flow hedges  involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements 
at january  and january   we had no outstanding swap agreements 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates  net of taxes  would have an approximate million impact to our financial position  liquidity and results of operation
