our retail stores operating as jo ann fabrics and crafts traditional stores and jo ann superstores feature a variety of competitively priced merchandise used in sewing  crafting and home decorating projects  including fabrics  notions  crafts  frames  scrapbooking material  artificial and dried flowers  home accents  finished seasonal and home d cor merchandise 
as of january   we operated stores in states traditional stores and superstores 
our traditional stores offer a complete selection of fabric and a convenience assortment of crafts  floral  finished seasonal and home d cor merchandise 
our traditional stores average  square feet and generated net sales per store of approximately million in fiscal our superstores offer an expanded and more comprehensive product assortment than our traditional stores 
our superstores also offer custom framing  floral arrangement and educational programs that our traditional stores do not 
our superstores that opened prior to fiscal average approximately  square feet and generated net sales per store of approximately million in fiscal our current superstore prototype averages  square feet and targets sales of million for its first year of operation 
we opened of these new prototype superstores in fiscal and we currently have of the prototype superstores in operation at january  fourteen of the prototype superstores have been open at least one year and averaged million in net sales in their first year of operation 
we review and manage to a number of key indicators in evaluating financial performance  the most significant of which are net sales  including same store sales by our two store formats  traditional stores and superstores 
net sales measures our overall sales growth and same store sales measures whether our existing stores continue to grow their sales volume 
we also closely monitor per transaction average ticket value and customer traffic  both in total and by store format 
these indicators help measure our effectiveness in attracting customers into our stores and the effectiveness of our product assortment  promotions and service on sales 
we also measure our sales per square foot performance in both of our store formats and compare them with our immediate competitors 
gross margin rate to sales 
in addition  gross margin return on investment gmroi is used by our merchandising organization to evaluate the gross margin performance relative to the average inventory investment 
merchandise selection and future decisions are  in part  based on the gmroi performance 
selling  general and administrative expense as a rate to sales 
we also compare operating margins to those of our competitors 

table of contents inventory turnover 
we monitor and focus extensive effort on managing our inventory investment  which is our single largest invested asset 
increasing inventory turnover is critical to improving our working capital position and improving our overall gmroi 
debt to total capitalization

restatement of financial statements we have restated the consolidated balance sheet at january   and the consolidated statements of operations  changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the years ended january  and february  in this annual report on form k 
we have also restated our quarterly financial information for fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the restatement and a summary of the effects of these changes on our consolidated balance sheets as of january   as well as on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for fiscal years and the accompanying management s discussion and analysis gives effect to these corrections 
on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec issued a letter to the center for public company audit firms of the american institute of certified public accountants  which clarified existing generally accepted accounting principles gaap applicable to leases and leasehold improvements 
we have consistently accounted for leases in accordance with our interpretation of gaap and common industry practice 
after conducting an internal review of our lease accounting procedures  and after discussion by management and the chairperson of the audit committee of the board of directors of the company with its independent registered public accounting firm  we determined that our historical accounting for leases was not consistent with the accounting principles described in the sec s letter 
accordingly  we decided to restate our financial statements for prior periods to correct these errors 
we do not believe the differences in prior years financial statements were material to any individual year presented 
further  the restatement adjustments are non cash and had no impact on net sales or same store sales figures 
we have reviewed our property lease portfolio and have recognized the effect of pre opening rent holidays over the related lease terms on a straight line basis 
tenant allowances have been reclassified from net property and equipment to other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
tenant allowances have also been reclassified from a reduction of depreciation and amortization expense to a reduction of rent expense in the consolidated statements of operations and from a reduction of capital expenditures to an increase in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal year have been adjusted for the after tax impact of earlier periods 
while we do not consider the net dollar amounts to be material to net earnings  financial position or net cash flows for any individual period presented  we believe it is appropriate to align our historical accounting results with the sec s comments on lease accounting under gaap  and we have done so  as reflected in our decision to restate results for certain prior years 
these accounting changes reduced net income by million for the fiscal year ended january  and increased net income by million for the fiscal year ended february   and resulted in a million reduction in retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal year we have not amended and do not intend to amend our previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the periods affected by the restatement that ended prior to january  for this reason  the consolidated financial statements  auditors reports and related financial information for the affected periods contained in such reports should no longer be relied upon 

table of contents executive overview of fiscal fiscal represented our third consecutive year of strong operating performance  after completing a turnaround announced at the end of fiscal that was substantially completed in fiscal our strategy is to grow by replacing many of our existing traditional stores with superstores 
our research has demonstrated that our customers have a better perception of the quality and pricing of our products when they are presented in our superstore format 
we believe that our prototype  square foot superstore gives us a competitive advantage in the industry 
our superstores provide a unique shopping experience by offering a full creative selection sewing  crafting  framing  seasonal  floral and home d cor accessories all under one roof 
on average we close traditional stores for every superstore that we open 
our superstores typically average over three times the revenues of the traditional stores they replace 
in markets where we have opened multiple superstores  we have been able to grow our revenues significantly and  we believe  expanded the market size and our market share 
in addition to the strong operating performance  a number of strategic initiatives were accomplished in fiscal continued the rollout of our new  square foot prototype superstore  opening of these stores during fiscal our current superstore prototype is percent smaller than our larger superstore format and displays our destination assortment of fabric and crafts in a visually exciting  yet productive format 
refinanced our subordinated debt and amended our bank credit facility 
in february  we issued million of percent senior subordinated notes  which enabled us to repurchase the remaining million of our percent senior subordinated notes that were outstanding at the beginning of the year 
in april  we amended our senior credit facility  extending the term until may and reducing the commitment to million see note financing 
these financing actions position us to successfully execute our planned growth strategy over the next three to five years 
highlights of our financial performance in fiscal are as follows net sales increased percent to billion 
same store sales increased percent versus a same store sales increase of percent in the prior year 
we expanded our gross profit margin by basis points  to percent of net revenue from percent in fiscal this improvement was primarily due to our strategic decision to be less promotional 
we grew net earnings by percent 
net income was per diluted share  compared to per diluted share in fiscal we delivered this solid earnings growth in spite of the higher expenses caused by increased store openings and closings  and investments in our future 
we opened superstores compared with in fiscal we continued to focus on debt reduction and the strengthening of our balance sheet and lowered our debt levels  net of cash  by million

the award of restricted stock offers employees the opportunity to earn shares of our stock over time  rather than options that provide employees the right to purchase stock at a set price 
stock options continue to be awarded on a selective basis to new employees and employees who are promoted into certain management positions 
in fiscal  the compensation committee of the board of directors approved an annual base award of restricted stock to certain of our employees that serves as both a retention vehicle and is coupled with performance awards 
the base and performance awards vest percent at the end of three years  with the remaining percent vesting at the end of the fourth year 
the base award grants  which are time based awards  amounted to approximately  restricted shares in fiscal the performance based award provides the potential to receive generally up to three times that amount in additional shares 
the number of performance award shares ultimately received  if any  will depend on achieving certain earnings performance goals over the three year time frame 
the expense recognition for the value of restricted shares is based on the vesting period and an estimate regarding certain performance levels over the three year measurement period 
off balance sheet transactions our liquidity is not currently dependent on the use of off balance sheet transactions other than letters of credit and operating leases  which are typical in a retail environment 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our future cash outflows resulting from contractual obligations and commitments as of january  payments due by period less than after total year years years years percent senior subordinated notes percent senior subordinated notes interest letters of credit operating leases total contractual cash obligations interest is included as a contractual obligation on the percent senior subordinated notes only 
the calculation of interest on the senior bank credit facility is dependent on the average borrowings during the year and a variable interest rate  which currently approximates percent set at basis points over libor 
we did not include these amounts due to their subjectivity and estimation required 
see liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity for further discussion of the senior bank credit facility 
includes commercial letters of credit of million and million of standby letters of credit 
the remaining cash payments include million associated with lease obligations for stores closed 
seasonality and inflation our business exhibits seasonality  which is typical for most retail companies 
our sales are much stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year 
net earnings are highest during the months of september through december when sales volumes provide significant operating leverage 
working capital 
table of contents requirements needed to finance our operations fluctuate during the year and reach their highest levels during the second and third fiscal quarters as we increase our inventory in preparation for our peak selling season 
summarized below are key line items by quarter from our statements of operations and balance sheets fiscal fiscal qtr qtr qtr qtr qtr qtr qtr qtr restated restated net sales same store sales percentage change gross margin gross margin percent to sales operating profit operating profit percent to sales net income loss inventories long term debt we believe that inflation has not had a significant effect on the growth of net sales or on net income over the past three years 
there can be no assurance  however  that our operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates management strives to report the company s financial results in a clear and understandable manner 
we follow generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
the principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and or conditions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements  but the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are as follows inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
inventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments 
these include estimates of shrink  as well as estimates of net realizable value on product designated for clearance  which affects the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the gross margins reported for the year 
our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our recent store physical inventories 
these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger 
substantially all of our store physical inventory counts are taken in the first three quarters of each year and the shrink accrual recorded at january  is based on shrink results of prior physical inventories 
all of our store locations that have been open one year or more are physically inventoried once a year 
we will continue to monitor and adjust our shrink rate estimates based on the results of store physical inventories and shrink trends 
we estimate our reserve for clearance product based on the consideration of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  quantities of slow moving or carryover seasonal merchandise on hand  historical recovery statistics and future merchandising plans 
the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends 

table of contents vendor allowances all vendor consideration received  including cash discounts  volume discounts and co operative advertising fees are included as a reduction of cost of sales 
cash discounts and volume discounts are recognized in cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold 
historically  we have recognized co operative advertising fees when received from our vendors 
beginning january   upon the adoption of eitf issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  and the execution of new or modifications of existing vendor agreements  we recognize co operative advertising fees when the related merchandise is sold 
the effect of adopting eitf issue did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
gift cards proceeds from the sale of gift cards are recorded as a gift card liability and recognized as sales when redeemed by the holder 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future estimated net cash flows to be generated by those assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and  we performed the required annual impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
accrued store closing costs prior to december   we accrued costs related to stores closed or identified for closing  which included future rental obligations  carrying costs  and other closing costs 
these expenses were accrued when we had committed to closing or relocating a store and were calculated at the lesser of future rental obligations remaining under the lease less estimated sublease rental income or the estimated lease termination cost 
the determination of the accrual was dependent on our ability to make estimates of costs to be incurred post closing and of sublease rental income to be received from subleases 
differences in our estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement different from the calculated accrual 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
which requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
sfas no 
replaces eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december   and we began to account for the costs of store closings under sfas no 
on that date 
accrued expenses we estimate certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
our most material estimates relate to compensation  taxes and insurance related expenses  portions of which are self insured 
our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on insurance claims processed as well as historical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
these estimates are based on historical loss development factors 
our employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on our medical claims processed as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
differences in our estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual 
table of contents requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
however  such differences have not been historically significant for fiscal years  and operating leases rent expense for our operating leases  which may have escalating rentals over the term of the lease  is recorded on a straight line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured 
the initial lease term includes the build out period of our leases  where no rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
the difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as deferred rent and is included in the consolidated balance sheets 
construction allowances received from landlords are recorded as a deferred rent credit and amortized to rent expense over the initial term of the lease 
the company s statement of cash flows reflects the receipt of construction allowances as an increase in cash flows from operating activities 
income taxes we do business in various jurisdictions that impose income taxes 
management determines the aggregate amount of income tax expense to accrue and the amount currently payable based upon the tax statutes of each jurisdiction 
this process involves adjusting income determined using gaap for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences that will reverse in subsequent years 
if different judgments had been made  our tax expense  assets and liabilities could have been different 
our current tax provision can be affected by our mix of income and identification or resolution of uncertain tax positions 
because income from different jurisdictions may be taxed at different rates  the shift in mix during a year or over years can cause the effective tax rate to change 
we base our rate during the year on our best estimate of an annual effective rate  and update those estimates quarterly 
we also regularly evaluate the status and likely outcome of uncertain tax positions 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements  that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations on merchandise that is sourced internationally and the impact of interest rate changes on our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
we believe foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations do not contain significant market risk due to the nature of our relationships with our international vendors 
all merchandise contracts are denominated in us dollars and are subject to negotiation prior to our commitment for purchases 
as a result  there is not a direct correlation between merchandise prices and fluctuations in the exchange rate 
we sourced approximately percent of our purchases internationally in fiscal our international purchases are concentrated in china and other asian countries 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our objective in managing the exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the volatility and impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
this is accomplished through the debt structure we set in place in early fiscal  which consisted of the fixed rate million notes and our variable rate credit facility  which is designed to be a working capital facility 
we estimate that a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates  based on fiscal average debt levels  would cause an increase or decrease to interest expense of million 
in the past  we also utilized interest rate swaps to achieve our objective of managing our exposure to interest rate changes 
we utilized interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related 
table of contents to our variable rate bank credit facilities 
we have a million interest rate swap with a fixed libor of percent that expires on april  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we have reviewed and designated our interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge and recognized the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement on the balance sheet in accrued expenses 
changes in the fair value of this agreement is recorded in other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings as the underlying hedged item affects earnings 
during fiscal and fiscal  unrealized after tax net gains of million and million  respectively  were recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
the fiscal after tax net loss included a million cumulative transition adjustment  as of the date of adoption of sfas no
