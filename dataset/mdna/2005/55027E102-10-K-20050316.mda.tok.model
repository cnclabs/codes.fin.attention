item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included below in item and risk factors included above in item of this annual report on form k 
overview during  there were several factors that affected our financial performance as compared with the previous year  many of which we believe will positively affect our future operating results and plans 
these factors were i the hiring of patrick j 
balthrop as our chief executive officer  ii a increase in revenues as compared to  iii increased acceptance and utilization of our technology in the marketplace as evidenced by our continued increase in royalty revenue  iv gross margin improvement relative to the prior year  and v a decrease in operating expenses as a percent of revenue 
on may   the company hired patrick balthrop as the permanent chief executive officer replacing tom erickson  who served as the company s interim president and chief executive officer since september mr 
balthrop comes to luminex from fisher scientific international inc fisher scientific where  since  he served as president of fisher healthcare  a fisher scientific company 
prior to fisher scientific  balthrop served in a number of leadership positions for over years with abbott laboratories abbott  primarily in abbott s diagnostics division 
total revenue increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as previously disclosed  we have yet to see a great deal of predictability in the buying patterns of our customers  which has resulted in variability in both revenue mix and volume  however  revenues increased in all areas from the prior year 
as a result of this variability  we experienced shifts in our revenue mix relative to in  system revenues represented of total revenue 
consumable revenues  royalty revenue and all other revenue represented   and  respectively 
in  system revenues were  consumable revenues were  royalty revenues were and all other revenue was 
our royalty revenue increased to million  from million in  representing over million in royalty bearing sales by our partners reported during as additional partners commercialize and expand their menu offerings  we expect royalty revenues will continue to grow 
we believe that this increase is an indication of the acceptance and utilization of our technology over a broader base 
in addition  another key indicator of technology acceptance is long term consumable purchases 
for the ninth consecutive quarter our month moving average of consumable sales has increased 
at december   our month moving average of quarterly consumable sales was million 
as a result of the variability of the revenue mix  we have experienced some related variability in both absolute gross profit and the corresponding gross margin percentage 
for comparative purposes  we had gross profit in and of million and million  respectively 
additionally  gross margin percentage over the same periods was and  respectively 
the fluctuations in both gross profit and gross margin percentage on a quarterly basis can be primarily attributed to the variability of the revenue mix and secondarily to the increases in the cost of our system during the second quarter of total consumable and royalty revenue  our highest margin items  accounted for of total revenue for furthermore  we recorded a contractual adjustment of  during the year related to a purchase commitment that was unfulfilled by one of our partners and contractual adjustments totaling  related to the forfeiture of prepaid royalty deposits that were not utilized prior to their contractual expiration 
these factors  coupled with the mix changes  contributed to increased gross profit and gross margin percentage for the year 
operating expenses have decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the results of our strategic study in have allowed us to focus our efforts on the markets in which we believe we have the highest level of sustainable competitive advantage 
these markets are i profile oriented screening  ii secondary screening  iii genetic disease testing  iv molecular infectious disease testing and v immunodiagnostics 
our focus on these distinct market segments has contributed to the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
over the course of the past months  we have also increased our core research and development efforts 
table of contents with a concentration on continued improvements to our technology and product offerings 
additionally  we have focused our business development efforts on these markets in order to keep our partner and content pipeline active 
all of these efforts have taken place with relatively constant use of resources and have resulted in revenue growth  gross margin growth and improvement to our net loss 
our ability to achieve profitability continues to depend upon our ability to establish and maintain successful strategic partnerships with companies that will develop and market products incorporating our technology and market and distribute our systems and consumables 
our strategic partners may develop application specific bioassay kits for use on our systems that they will sell to their customers  may perform testing services for third parties using our technology or may buy our products and then resell those products to their customers  all generating royalties for us 
at december   we had strategic partners who had either released commercialized products based on the luminex platform or were redistributing our products and were reporting royalties 
these commercialized  royalty submitting  strategic partners provided of total revenues for as we continue to strive towards making xmap technology a standard for performing bioassays within our key segments  we believe that we need to continue to concentrate on the following objectives i enhancing our focus on large and fast growing segments of the life science and diagnostics markets  ii forging key partnerships to broaden and accelerate market acceptance of our technology  iii further enabling our partners to design and develop tests using our technology  and iv expanding the functionality of our xmap technology based product line  including hardware  software and consumables 
a critical component of these objectives will be to continually enhance our position via a customer focused development process and a customer focused service strategy 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue on sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
generally  these criteria are met at the time our product is shipped 
if the criteria for revenue recognition are not met at the time of shipment  the revenue is deferred until all criteria are met 
royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells products incorporating our technology  provides testing services to third parties using our technology or resells our consumables 
royalty revenue is recognized as it is reported to us by our partners 
we also sell extended service contracts for maintenance and support of our products 
revenue for service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
total deferred revenue as of december  was million and primarily consisted of i unamortized license fees for non exclusive licenses and patent rights to certain luminex technologies in the amount of million  ii unamortized revenue related to extended service contracts in the amount of million  and iii upfront payments from strategic partners to be used for the purchase of products or to be applied towards future royalty payments in the amount of  upfront payments from our strategic partners are nonrefundable and will be recognized as revenue as our strategic partners purchase products or apply such amounts against royalty payments 
nonrefundable license fees are amortized into revenue over the estimated life of the license agreements 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
at december   the two major components of the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory were i a specific reserve for inventory items that we no longer use in the manufacture of our products or that no longer meet our specifications and ii a reserve against slow moving items for potential obsolescence 
the total estimated allowance is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 

table of contents we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses historically have been within our expectations  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of credit losses that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our significant customers  or a deterioration in the economic environment  in general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts

these five partners purchased  or  of the total system sales in consumable sales  comprised of microspheres and sheath fluid  increased to million during from million in we believe the increase is primarily the result of the increased use and acceptance of our technology and the increased installed base of our systems 
partners who reported royalty bearing sales accounted for million  or  of total consumable sales for the year ended december  in addition  during  we had bulk purchases of consumables totaling approximately million as compared with bulk purchases totaling approximately million in the prior year 
a bulk purchase is defined as the purchase of  or more of consumables in a quarter 
as the number of applications available on our platform expands  we expect to see the overall level of consumable sales continue to rise 
royalty revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we believe this increase is also primarily the result of the increased use and acceptance of our technology 
for the year ended december   we had commercial partners submit royalties as compared with for the year ended december  additionally  the partners from whom we recognized million in royalties in represented approximately million of the total royalties in  an increase of approximately over their prior year payments

gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the gross margin percentage increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to an increase in the high margin items consumables and royalties as a percentage of total revenue and the allocation of our fixed costs over a higher revenue base 
however  these factors were partially offset by margin compression resulting from the higher cost of the new laser configuration beginning in the second quarter of for the current year  consumables and royalties represented of total revenue as compared with for the prior year 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs associated with the addition of employees in late and research and development headcount at december  was as a percentage of revenue  research and development expense was in and in selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs associated with the net addition of eight employees over our december  selling  general and administrative headcount of  incremental stock compensation charges related to equity issuances to employees and expenses associated with section compliance 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and in we believe that our selling  general and administrative expenses are highly leverageable and can support additional revenue with relatively minimal additions

additionally  we believe the elimination of our direct sales force and assistance to our partners in their development and commercialization efforts allayed fears of direct competition with us 
for the year ended december  four of our partners individually accounted for or greater of total system placements and collectively accounted for of our luminex system sales of systems 
consumable sales  comprised of microspheres and sheath fluid  increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of the increased installed base of commercial luminex systems as compared to the prior year

gross margin percentage 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to two factors i reductions in our fixed costs as part of the restructuring efforts undertaken by the company in and the allocation of our remaining fixed costs over a higher revenue base and ii gross margin in was adversely affected by the inclusion of costs associated with the cancellation or delay of inventory items no longer used in production and a charge taken to allow for slow moving inventory 
our production schedule was adjusted during that period to reflect a lower expected rate of system orders 

table of contents operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased to million in from million in as a result of the one time business restructuring charge of million incurred in  the elimination of expenses related to rules based medicine  inc rbm as of september of million and reduced operations costs following the business restructuring 
a breakdown of operating expenses for the years ended december  and is as follows year ended december  research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses business restructuring charges research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to the effects of our restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter of and to the elimination of expenditures related to rbm as of september rbm research and development expenses totaled approximately million in specific components contributing to this net decrease  exclusive of the elimination of rbm expenditures in  were a reduction in research and development personnel costs of  and a reduction in professional fees of  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to our restructuring and cost control efforts and included reduced personnel costs of approximately million  a decrease in stock compensation expense of million  reductions in travel  entertainment and marketing expenses of  and other reductions of approximately  stock compensation expense of million in was primarily related to the sale of our rbm business unit

during  we incurred cash expenditures totaling approximately million and non cash and other charges of approximately  related to our business restructuring 
as of december   the company has completed the business restructuring plan and no other expenditures are expected 
non recurring items 
there were non recurring items related to settlement of litigation in and to impairment of our rbm investment in as a result of a procedural omission  the company is unable to pursue a patent in japan  which corresponds to some of the company s issued us patents related to the company s method of real time detection and quantification of multiple analytes from a single sample 
on january   the company filed a lawsuit in travis county  texas state district court alleging negligence and breach of contract on the part of former patent counsel 
on march   the parties executed a full  final and complete release regarding such action  without an admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of the defendants 
as consideration in connection with the settlement and release  the company received approximately million  net of legal and related costs and expenses 
as a result  this was a one time benefit that further reduced the net loss for on september   the company transferred assets related to rbm  consisting of cash  property and equipment with a fair value of approximately million  to rbm  a newly formed company headed by the company s former chairman  chief executive officer and co founder 
the company periodically analyzed its strategic investment for impairment considered other than temporary 
in performing its analysis on this strategic investment  the company first evaluated whether general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole  or specific information pertaining to the investment s industry or the individual entity  indicated that a 
table of contents decline in value that is other than temporary had occurred 
then the company considered specific factors  including the financial condition and near term prospects of the investment  any specific events that may affect the investee company  and the intent and ability of the company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
at december   based upon current estimates of future cash flow  current market conditions and current profitability  the company made the decision to permanently impair the strategic investment 
as a result of this decision  the company recognized million in impairment charges for the year ended december   and such amount is recorded as impairment of investment in the consolidated statements of operations 
net loss 
the net loss decreased to million in from million in the decrease in net loss in was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue  the increase in gross margin percentage  the decrease in operating expenses discussed above  and the proceeds from settlement of litigation in without the investment impairment charge taken in quarterly results the following table sets forth certain quarterly financial data for the periods indicated in thousands  except per share data 
quarter ended march  june  september  december  revenue gross profit loss from operations net loss basic loss per share quarter ended march  june  september  december  revenue gross profit loss from operations net loss basic loss per share liquidity and capital resources at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of million 
as of december  and  working capital was million and million  respectively 
we have funded our operations to date primarily through the issuance of equity securities 
our cash reserves are held directly or indirectly in a variety of short term and long term  interest bearing instruments  including obligations of the united states government or agencies thereof and us corporate debt securities with maturities of two years or less 
cash used in operations was million for the year ended december  significant items affecting operating cash flow for the period were the net loss of million and net inventory increases of million 
we expect operating cash flow for to approximate operating cash flow 

table of contents cash used in investing was million for the year ended december  as compared with  for the year ended december  in  we made million of net investments in obligations with maturities between months and year that are classified as short term investments and million of net investments in obligations with maturities between one year and two years that are classified as long term investments 
we made those investments to earn a higher rate of return  as we expect our cash and cash equivalents balance gives us sufficient liquidity for our near term operating needs 
currently  we do not expect any additional material changes in our sources or uses of cash 
our research and development expenses during the year ended december  were million 
research and development expenses related to the ongoing development of our xmap technology and consumables are currently expected to be in the range of and million on an annual basis for our expected increase in research and development expenses for relative to is a result of our content strategy and expanded focus on product development 
selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  were million 
we currently expect total selling  general and administrative expenses to be in the range of to million on an annual basis for the expected increase of selling  general and administrative expenses over those of is primarily a result of additional infrastructure and expansion to support our market driven initiatives and optimization and development of our partner relationships 
we presently outsource certain aspects of the assembly of our systems to contract manufacturers 
we have non cancelable purchase requirements with certain of our component suppliers that require us to take delivery of a minimum number of component parts for our products or the cost per unit will increase  which would adversely impact our gross margin 
we are not otherwise committed to scheduled purchase requirements 
however  because of a long lead time to delivery  we are required to place orders for a variety of items well in advance of scheduled production runs 
we currently have approximately million in non cancelable obligations for the next months 
these obligations are included in our estimated cash usage during the following table reflects the company s total current non cancelable obligations by period in thousands less than more than year years years years total non cancelable rental obligations non cancelable purchase obligations anticipated liquidity impact as of december  these obligations are primarily a result of normal inventory purchases 
purchase obligations do not extend beyond a year  however  we would expect future years to have purchase commitments that will arise in the ordinary course of business and will generally increase or decrease according to fluctuations in overall sales volume 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our success in developing and expanding markets for our products  payments under possible future strategic arrangements  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the need to acquire licenses to new technology  the status of competitive products and potential cost associated with both protecting and defending our intellectual property 
additionally  actions taken based on recommendations of our strategic consulting study or the ongoing internal evaluation of our business could result in expenditures not currently contemplated in our estimates for we believe  however  that our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our operating expenses  capital equipment requirements and other expected liquidity requirements through based upon our current operating plan and structure  management anticipates total cash use for  to be approximately to million  giving us an anticipated balance in cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments at december  of to million 
we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and deployment of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that debt or equity funds will be available on favorable 
table of contents terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  incurring debt financing could result in a substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  could render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns and could impose restrictions on our operations 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into agreements on unattractive terms 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income received on our cash balances is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in instruments that meet the definition of cash equivalents or in short term investments and are held to maturity 
a basis point fluctuation from average investment returns at december  would yield an approximate variance in overall investment return 
due to the nature of our investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
all payments for our products  including sales to foreign customers  are required to be made in us dollars  therefore  we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities 
accordingly  our foreign currency and currency market risk is limited
