item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview align technology  founded in april  designs  manufactures and markets invisalign  a proprietary method for treating malocclusion  or the misalignment of teeth 
invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear  nearly invisible  removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position 
because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires  invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces 
invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens with mature dentition 
align technology received fda clearance to market invisalign in  and we began commercial operations in july the invisalign product is manufactured in phases 
the initial step in our manufacturing process is the creation of electronic treatment plans using clincheck  an internally developed computer modeling program 
these treatment plans are developed in our operations facility in costa rica and are transmitted electronically back to the prescribing dental profession via clincheck 
clincheck allows dental professionals to simulate treatment in three dimensions by modeling two week stages of tooth movement 
upon the dental professional s approval of the clincheck simulation  we use the data underlying the simulation  in conjunction with stereolithography technology  to manufacture aligner molds 
a third party manufacturer in mexico uses these molds to fabricate aligners 
aligners are thin  clear plastic  removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each two week stage of the clincheck simulation 
aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck 
after the aligners are produced  the third party manufacturer ships the finished products to our customers 
we have two customer channels the orthodontist and the gp 
we have historically generated a majority of our revenues from orthodontists 
there exists  however  a significantly greater number of gps in north america than orthodontists 
as the primary care dental provider  gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists  and possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients on the benefits of oral care and introduce them to invisalign 
gps also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and may choose to treat less complex cases themselves 
we are committed to improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gps 
we believe that improved collaboration is beneficial to the orthodontist and the gp and will accelerate growth in invisalign cases and consequently increase our revenues 
in addition  although we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue to drive research for expanding invisalign applications  we expect that the percentage of revenue generated by gps will increase  largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists 
in  we expect to generate the majority of our revenue from gps 
we believe the expected increase in the number of cases treated by gps will result in an increase in the overall market for invisalign as patients that would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are introduced to invisalign by their gps 
sales to orthodontists and gps in our domestic market represented approximately of our total revenue during fiscal we expect to continue to increase our penetration into our domestic market 
we will also focus our efforts towards the expansion of our international markets 
in fiscal  we expect to increase our infrastructure and support in key countries in europe and initiate strategic moves in asia  specifically in japan  in order to take advantage of this emerging opportunity 
clinical education and ongoing training are critical to our customers success with invisalign 
we certify several thousand new orthodontists and gps to use invisalign annually  and we certified approximately  orthodontists and gps during fiscal  and we expect to certify approximately  during fiscal additionally  we share product enhancements  treatment tips and techniques  and clinical research data with our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements customers on an ongoing basis through continuing education in the form of hundreds of provider workshops  study clubs and online educational centers 
this information ensures that our customers understand invisalign s expanding applications and best uses  and feel confident about treating more of their patients with invisalign 
net revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of as compared to the year ended december  the increase was driven primarily by an increase in the number of cases submitted for the domestic general practitioner channel 
revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal were reduced by approximately million as a result of our case refinement policy change described below 
in certain instances  adjustments to a patient s teeth are made in the final stages of orthodontic treatment 
to make these final adjustments and move a patient s teeth to the final desired position  dental professionals may elect to use invisalign as a finishing treatment tool and order newly manufactured aligners 
these newly manufactured aligners  or case refinement  are not provided with the aligners produced as part of the initial treatment plan and are manufactured only upon the request of the dental professional if final adjustments are desired 
align s case refinement policy allows doctors to order one case refinement as part of their original lab fee  provided they submit the order prior to the point in time when the case is deemed completed  or the case expiration 
prior to the policy change announced in the fourth quarter of  align deemed the case expiration date to occur on the th day after the expected end of treatment 
under the new policy  the case expiration date is deemed to occur on the th day after the expected end of treatment 
gross profit percentage increased in fiscal to from for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to improved fixed cost absorption related to increasing volumes and continued manufacturing process improvements in both our treatment operations facility in costa rica and in the aligner fabrication process 
we recently filed a multi claim lawsuit against one of our founders and certain former employees 
among other things  the lawsuit alleges tortious and illegal actions arising out of the defendants plan to unlawfully utilize our intellectual property  confidential information and employees 
in addition  the lawsuit alleges that the defendants are in breach of contractual obligations  statutory law  and common law  for the purpose of attempting to intentionally interfere and disrupt our on going operations and improperly gain access to our customer relationships and trade secrets 
on february   orthoclear  chishti and certain other defendants filed a multi claim cross complaint against align and certain of our executive officers  senior management and a director alleging conspiracy  breach of contract  libel  slander  unjust enrichment  international interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair competition 
see part i item of this form k for a more complete summary of this legal proceeding 
we are in the early stages of evaluating the impact  if any  the events underlying this litigation may have on our business  competitive position in the market  our ability to retain our sales representatives and other matters related to the sale of our product 
in addition  although this lawsuit is in the early stages  litigation of this type  whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us  is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 
as a result  this litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and cause a decline in our stock price 
changes to previously announced fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year end results on january   we announced our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended december  subsequent to that date  we adjusted the cost of revenues for the quarter and year ended december  to include an additional  resulting from asset impairment charges identified by the company relating to manufacturing fixed assets at our international manufacturing facility 
net profit for the quarter and year ended december  was reduced by  and there was no change to basic or diluted earnings per share
