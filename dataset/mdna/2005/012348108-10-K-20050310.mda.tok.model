item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies and assumptions the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company records sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the timing of revenue recognition is dependent upon the contractual arrangement between the company and its customers 
these arrangements  which may include provisions for transfer of title and guarantees of workmanship  are specific to each customer 
sales contracts in the albany door systems segment may include product and installation services 
for these sales  the company applies the provisions of eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the company s contracts that include product and installation services generally do not qualify as separate units of accounting and  accordingly  revenue for the entire contract value is recognized upon completion of installation services 
the company limits the concentration of credit risk in receivables by closely monitoring credit and collection policies 
the company records allowances for sales returns as a deduction in the computation of net sales 
such provisions are recorded on the basis of written communication with customers and or historical experience 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company has interest rate swap agreements that fix the rate of interest on million of the company s debt 
the company has determined that the swaps qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with gaap and  accordingly  changes in the fair value of these swaps are recorded in shareholders equity in the caption  derivative valuation adjustment 
future events  such as a change in the company s underlying debt arrangements  could require that the company record changes in fair value in earnings 
the company values these swaps by estimating the cost of entering into one or more inverse swap transactions that would neutralize the original transactions 
as of december   the pretax cost to neutralize the original swap transactions would have been approximately million 
goodwill and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as significant changes in the business climate  plant closures  changes in product offerings  or other circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the company performs a test for goodwill impairment at least annually 
the determination of whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments based on short and long term projections of future performance 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances 
the company has investments in other companies that are accounted for under either the cost method  or equity method of accounting 
the investment accounted for under the cost method was included in other assets as of december  in  the company determined that investment to be other than temporarily impaired and  accordingly  recorded an impairment charge of million in other expense income  net  representing the full amount of the investment 
investments accounted for under the equity method are included in investments in associated companies 
the company performs regular reviews of the financial condition of the investees to determine if its investment is impaired 
if the financial condition of the investees were to no longer support their valuations  the company would record an impairment provision 
the company has pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates and expected return on plan assets  which are updated on an annual basis 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and postretirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
the amount of annual pension plan funding and annual expense is subject to many variables  including the investment return on pension plan assets and interest rates 
weakness in investment returns and low interest rates could result in the company making equal or greater pension plan contributions in future years  as compared to including anticipated contributions for all pension plans  the company has classified million of its accrued pension liability as a current liability at december  the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of differences between financial statement and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
a tax valuation allowance is established  as needed  to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in the event it becomes more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset allowances will not be needed  the valuation allowance will be adjusted 
the company has a trade accounts receivable program whereby it sells  without recourse  certain north american accounts receivable to a qualified special purpose entity qspe  as defined under financial accounting standard no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities fas no 

the qspe is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and  in accordance with fas no 
 its financial statements are not consolidated with the financial statements of the company 
the securitization program can be terminated at any time  with thirty days notice  by the company or the unrelated third party 
if the securitization program were terminated  the company would not be required to repay cash received from the sale of accounts receivable  but no additional receivables would be sold under the program 
accounts receivable would increase as new sales were made  and the note receivable would decrease as the sold accounts receivable were collected 
the company might need to borrow from its existing credit facilities or use existing cash to fund operations until cash flow from accounts receivable returned to normal levels 
the unconsolidated subsidiary receives cash from an unrelated third party in exchange for an undivided ownership interest in the accounts receivable 
as of december   the unconsolidated subsidiary had assets of million consisting primarily of million of accounts receivables sold to it by the company  net of a million interest sold to the unrelated third party  and an allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of december   the liabilities of the unconsolidated subsidiary were million consisting principally of the note payable to the company  and equity was million 
the company has contingent liabilities for litigation  claims and assessments that result from the ordinary course of business 
these matters are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item overview the company is engaged in three business segments engineered fabrics  albany door systems and applied technologies 
the company s largest segment is engineered fabrics  which includes paper machine clothing and process belts pmc  which are technologically sophisticated consumable products designed  manufactured and marketed for each section of the paper machine 
the design and material composition of clothing and belts can have a considerable effect on the quality of paper products produced and the efficiency of paper machines on which they are used 
paper machine clothing and belts have finite lives and must be replaced on a regular basis 
the company expends considerable effort on research and development to maintain what it believes to be its position as the technology leader in the marketplace  and to continually improve the production processes and deliver increased value to customers 
the company s operations are strategically located in the major paper producing regions of the world 
albany door systems produces and services high performance doors  which are primarily marketed to industrial and commercial enterprises requiring interior or external doors that either involve frequent openings or temperature or environmental contrasts on the two areas separated by the doors 
high performance doors open and close very rapidly  and may utilize electrical systems that assure automatic opening and closing under circumstances desired by customers 
although the company s high performance doors are marketed globally  its largest manufacturing operations are in north america and europe 
the applied technologies segment of the company includes a wide variety of products  from wet and dry filtration media to primaloft patented synthetic down for the home furnishings and outerwear markets 
although these products do not represent a large portion of total sales  they do offer the opportunity for growth as new markets are developed 
new product lines developed within this segment that do not provide expected returns are generally discontinued 
industry trends the engineered fabrics segment has experienced significant change since as consolidation and restructuring impacted the global paper and paperboard industry and reduced the number of major paper machine clothing competitors from eight to four 
during the last four years  this consolidation has resulted in a reduction of capacity in the paper machine clothing industry 
albany international is the paper machine clothing market leader  with about market share  as compared to about for the next largest competitor 
as part of the company s long term strategy to provide value to customers and to reduce costs to improve returns to shareholders  the company has rationalized production capacity by closing and consolidating manufacturing facilities in north america and europe  while increasing its presence in asia 
these actions enabled the company to lower costs and focus resources in regions where the company anticipates significant growth 
implementing capacity reduction and consolidation involves risks such as employee work stoppages  slowdowns or strikes  which can threaten uninterrupted production  maintenance of high product quality and the meeting of customers delivery deadlines 
increases in output in remaining manufacturing operations can likewise impose stress on these remaining facilities as they undertake the manufacture of a greater volume and  in some cases  greater variety of products 
competitors can be quick to attempt to exploit these situations 
the company considers these risks and plans each step of the process carefully  taking such steps as it can to address them in advance of any announcement of a planned or proposed plant closure or consolidation 
the company works to reassure customers who could be affected by any such matters that their requirements will continue to be met 
the company uses experience gained during previous consolidation initiatives in order to improve its processes and minimize these risks 
similarly  the company s papermaking customers have also gone through an extended period of consolidation and rationalization  which has in turn led to the reduction of their capacity in some markets  offset by additions of new  more efficient papermaking facilities in other markets  especially asia 
this appears to have had the effect of shutting down many older  inefficient paper machines  especially in north america  and reducing the overall number of global positions on paper machines where the company s products could be used 
since major consolidation and rationalization in the paper industry seems to be largely completed  the company expects their impact on pmc demand in future periods will be minimized 
technological advances in engineered fabrics  while contributing to the papermaking efficiency of customers  have in some cases lengthened the useful life of the company s products and reduced the number of pieces required to produce the same volume of paper 
while the company is often able to charge higher prices for its products as a result of these improvements  increased prices may not always be sufficient to offset completely a decrease in the number of fabrics sold 
after adjusting for currency translation effects  the company s net sales of engineered fabrics have decreased in each of the last three years 
the trend toward a decrease in the ratio of pmc consumed to paper produced may be a significant contributor to this decline 
if these trends were to continue  they could have a negative impact on net sales in this segment 
the company s strategy for dealing with these trends is to continue to focus on improving the performance of its products and improving its product mix and price structure  while at the same time identifying additional cost saving opportunities 
challenges  risks and opportunities the engineered fabrics segment of the business is very competitive 
while some competitors tend to compete more on the basis of price  and others attempt to compete more on the basis of technology  both are significant competitive factors in the industry 
the company s strategy for addressing competition is to focus on continuous improvement in the technical performance of its products and services that deliver greater value to customers than the offerings of competitors 
during the past three years  the company has spent an average of of its consolidated net sales on research expenses  and expects to spend similar amounts in future periods 
failure to maintain or increase the product and service value delivered to customers in future periods could have a material impact on sales in this segment 
one competitor in this segment is also in the business of making and selling paper machines and papermaking equipment 
it is thus able to market machines and fabrics together  and to condition machine warranties on the purchase and use of its clothing and belts 
the basic papermaking process  while it has undergone dramatic increases in efficiency and speed  has always relied on paper machine clothing 
in the event that a paper machine builder or other person were able to develop a commercially viable manner of paper manufacture that did not require paper machine clothing  sales of the company s products in this segment could be expected to decline significantly 
as paper machines currently represent significant investments of capital  the company does not believe that a commercially feasible substitute technology that does not employ pmc is likely to be developed and incorporated into the paper production process by paper manufacturers in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  the prospects for continued demand of pmc appear excellent 
albany door systems derives most of its revenue from the sale of high performance doors 
the purchase of these doors is normally a capital expenditure item for customers and  as such  market opportunities tend to fluctuate with industrial capital spending 
the majority of the segment s revenues are derived from sales and manufacturing outside of the united states  which can cause the reported financial results to be more sensitive to changes in currency rates than the other segments of the company 
the applied technologies segment has experienced significant growth in net sales during the last two years  due to the introduction of new products and growth in demand and application of previously existing products 
while opportunities for continued growth remain excellent  there can be no assurances that the growth in sales enjoyed during the last two years will continue 
foreign currency albany international operates in many geographic regions of the world and has more than half of its business in countries outside the united states 
a substantial portion of the company s sales are denominated in euros or other currencies 
in some locations  the profitability of transactions is affected by the fact that sales are denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the costs to manufacture and distribute the products are denominated 
as a result  changes in the relative values of us dollars  euros and other currencies affect revenues and profits as the results are translated into us dollars in the consolidated financial statements 
from time to time  the company enters into foreign currency or other derivative contracts in order to enhance cash flows  or to mitigate volatility in the financial statements that can be caused by changes in currency exchange rates 
review of operations vs 
total company net sales increased to million in  as compared to million for changes in currency translation rates had the effect of increasing net sales by million 
excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  net sales decreased as compared to following is a table of net sales for each business segment and the effect of changes in currency translation rates net sales as reported year ended december  percent change in thousands increase in net sales due to changes in currency translation rates as reported excluding currency rate effect engineered fabrics albany door systems applied technologies total gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for and for the decrease was principally due to lower sales in the engineered fabrics segment  excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was also negatively affected by the effect of changes in currency exchange rates on export sales 
these sales are typically denominated in us dollars  while the manufacturing costs are based mainly on currencies that strengthened against the us dollar 
in  gross profit was lower by approximately million as a result of the currency effect on these export sales 
despite those negative effects  cost reduction activities helped to generate a gross profit percentage that increased during the last six months of selling  general  technical and research expenses increased in as compared to excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  these costs decreased 
in  selling and general expenses included million of remeasurement losses at certain company operations related to trade accounts receivable denominated in currencies other than their functional currency  while in  the losses were negligible 
selling  general  technical and research expenses remains an area where the company believes there are substantial opportunities for efficiency improvements 
the fact that this category of expense was relatively flat excluding currency effects  means that the company s efficiency improvements offset sharp increases in sarbanes oxley costs  as well nearly all other cost categories that were affected by general inflation 
following is a table of operating income and restructuring charges by segment years ended december  in thousands operating income engineered fabrics albany door systems applied technologies research expense unallocated expenses operating income restructuring costs by segment engineered fabrics albany door systems applied technologies corporate and other consolidated total operating income decreased to million for  compared to million for the decrease is principally due to higher restructuring costs in  and the lower sales in the engineered fabrics segment  excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates 
changes in currency translation rates had the effect of increasing operating income by million  while the effect of currency rates on us dollar denominated export sales decreased operating income by million 
in january  the company announced a restructuring program that it anticipated would reduce costs by at least million per year 
in january  the company announced that the plan had succeeded in reducing costs by more than million per year 
the restructuring activities associated with this program were completed in approximately half of the cost savings were recognized through the end of  with the remainder of the cost reductions taking effect in the first half of approximately of the cost reductions were in the engineered fabrics segment  the reductions principally affect cost of goods sold 
the restructuring initiative  which resulted in a reduction of approximately employees  was part of a continuing effort to match manufacturing capacity to the global demand for paper machine clothing 
the cost reduction initiative resulted in restructuring charges of million in and million in the charges include plant and equipment write downs of approximately million in and million in the majority of these restructuring costs related to the shut down of the company s engineered fabrics segment facilities in south carolina  france  and the netherlands and discontinuation of dryer fabrics manufacturing at the facility in bury  england 
research expense increased million to million in  principally due to the effect of changes in currency translation rates 
unallocated expenses increased million to million in principally due to increases in corporate headquarters expense  including million for the company s united states postretirement medical benefits program  and million related to the restricted stock program see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in postretirement benefits was due to higher cost trend rates  while the increase in the cost of the restricted stock program was due to the program being initiated at the end of interest expense declined to million for compared to million for  principally due to lower average debt in a significant portion of the company s interest expense is derived from interest rate swap agreements 
interest expense related to the swaps amounted to million in and million in other expense income  net  was expense of million for and million for the increase in expense is primarily due to currency hedging activities  and the remeasurement of short term intercompany balances at operations that held amounts denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
in  these transactions resulted in expense of million compared with income of million in the company s currency hedging strategy is aimed at mitigating volatility in the income statement that can be caused by sharp changes in currency exchange rates 
the company uses various derivative instruments  primarily currency forward contracts  in its currency hedging activities 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with fas no 
are reported in other comprehensive income  and not other expense income  net 
additionally  in the first quarter of  the company recorded an impairment loss of million representing the full value of the company s investment in an unaffiliated company 
income tax expense was million in compared to million in  principally due to lower income before tax 
income tax in includes expense of million for valuation allowances related to restructuring activities  and a tax benefit of million related to the favorable resolution of discrete tax matters 
the results for include a tax benefit of million for the favorable resolution of tax contingencies 
including the effect of these discrete tax items  the tax rate was of pre tax income in  and in the decrease in the tax rate was partially attributable to a change in the mix of the company s consolidated earnings 
the company expects that the tax rate will not exceed  before any discrete items 
net income was million for  compared to million for basic earnings per share were for  compared to for the decrease is principally due to higher restructuring charges in restructuring charges reduced net income by per share in  compared to per share in the decrease in net income was also affected by lower engineered fabrics sales excluding changes in currency translation rates  and the income tax valuation allowances recorded in engineered fabrics segment net sales in the engineered fabrics segment increased to million for as compared to million for changes in currency translation rates had the effect of increasing net sales by million 
excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  net sales decreased as compared to pricing for products in this segment was generally flat  while overall volume decreased 
in  global paper and paperboard manufacturers continued to produce more tons of product with fewer units of paper machine clothing pmc 
several factors contributed to this trend  including enhanced pmc product performance that creates additional value for our customers  more efficient paper machine operation as a result of industry consolidation and rationalization  and the practice by some paper manufacturers to run pmc products longer 
since the rate of paper industry consolidation and rationalization appears to have slowed  the company expects the negative impact of this effect on pmc demand in future periods to decrease 
matching the company s capacity to the changing demand of the global paper and board industries  while a difficult challenge  has made the company stronger and well positioned to meet the needs of its customers 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for compared to for the decrease in was principally due to lower sales excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  and the currency effect on us dollar denominated export sales 
operating income decreased from million in to million in  principally due to an increase of million in restructuring charges  in addition to the same factors that affected gross profit 
albany door systems segment net sales in the albany door systems segment increased to million in as compared to million for changes in currency translation rates had the effect of increasing net sales by million 
excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  net sales increased as compared to high performance door sales remained sluggish as increases in customers capital spending did not to materialize 
approximately of the sales in this segment are in european markets and  accordingly  results are significantly impacted by european economies 
the company provides aftermarket service and parts for high performance doors  and this revenue component grew to million in  compared to million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for compared to for operating income improved from a loss of million in  to income of million in approximately million of the improvement is due to lower restructuring costs 
results for the full year were positively affected by efficiency improvements  new product development  and increases in aftermarket and service revenues  even though customers capital spending for high performance door products did not improve in major markets 
applied technologies segment net sales in the applied technologies segment increased to million in as compared to million for changes in currency translation rates had the effect of increasing net sales by million 
excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  net sales increased as compared to filtration products for power generation plants  principally in australia  and gains in tannery and textile markets in asia and latin america provided a large portion of the improvement in this segment

the resulting impact on demand for the company s products adversely affected sales in the engineered fabrics segment 
sales of high performance doors were similarly affected as industrial customers continued constraints on capital spending 
the company continued to focus on new product introductions in the engineered fabrics and high performance door segments in net sales in the applied technologies segment improved and also reflected the effect of new product developments 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for and for in  gross profit was negatively affected by the weaker us dollar on sales exported from europe 
these sales are typically denominated in us dollars  while the manufacturing costs are based mainly on currencies that strengthened against the us dollar 
in  gross profit was lower by approximately million as a result of the currency effect on these export sales 
gross profit in was also negatively affected by higher costs for insurance million and pension benefits million 
the increase in insurance costs was driven by market pricing for insurance  while increased pension costs were related to decreases in the discount rate and unfavorable performance on pension plan assets

the cost reduction initiative announced in january resulted in restructuring charges of million  which included million in plant and equipment write downs and million in termination and other costs 
the majority of these restructuring costs relate to the shut down of the company s engineered fabrics segment facility in greenville  south carolina  and s lestat  france 
research expense increased million to million in principally due to the effect of changes in currency translation rates 
unallocated expenses decreased million to million in principally due to termination of the deferred compensation plan for active employees in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  net sales decreased as compared to although the operating rates of the paper and paperboard industries might be expected to rise as a result of the reductions in capacity produced by their consolidations  reported operating rates in the united states improved only slightly for paper and declined for paperboard 
in europe  operating rates remained soft 
growth in the paper and paperboard industry  the company s principal market  was flat in most regions except asia 
the united states consumption of papermachine clothing has decreased approximately during the last five years  while consumption in europe has increased approximately 
the decrease in consumption of paper machine clothing in the united states reflects a shift in paper making to different regions  principally asia 
unit pricing of paper machine clothing was decreasing during the late s  but was steadier and  in some product lines  improved during as a result of these factors  unit sales volume of global paper machine clothing decreased approximately while pricing was relatively stable

excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  net sales increased as compared to new products and market opportunities are driving growth in this segment 
for example  the expansion of primaloft premium synthetic insulation into the european and japanese markets is providing continued growth for this product 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for compared to for operating income increased to million compared to million for the increase is principally due to higher sales 
international activities the company conducts more than half of its business in countries outside of the united states 
as a result  the company experiences transaction and translation gains and losses because of currency fluctuations 
the company periodically enters into foreign currency contracts to hedge this exposure see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the risks associated with its operations and locations outside the united states are not other than those normally associated with operations in such locations 
liquidity and capital resources the company finances its business activities primarily with cash generated from operations and borrowings  primarily under the revolving credit agreement described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
company subsidiaries outside of the united states may also maintain working capital lines with local banks  but borrowings under such local facilities tend not to be significant 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  compared with million for  and million for the decrease from to was principally due to an increase of million in cash used for restructuring charges 
a significant portion of the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was due to higher net sales as reported in us dollars  and the resulting impact on operating income 
cash flow also reflected a provision for deferred income taxes and other long term liabilities of million  compared to provisions of million in and million in the lower use of cash for these provisions in was principally due to a tax refund 
accounts receivable at december   decreased million while inventory increased million as compared to december  excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  accounts receivable and inventories decreased a total of million 
while the company will continue efforts to reduce the amount of working capital invested in accounts receivable and inventories  there can be no assurance that the increase in cash flow will be repeated in future periods 
the company has a program to sell a portion of its north american accounts receivable 
this program is described in detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this form of financing results in a lower current incremental cost of financing than the lowest rate on the company s revolving credit agreement  and it broadens the company s sources of financing 
in exchange for the accounts receivable sold  the company receives cash and a note 
the note is subject to monthly fluctuation based on the amount of receivables sold and bears interest at variable rates 
as of december   the interest rate was per annum 
as described above under critical accounting policies and assumptions  in the event that the receivables program was terminated  the company would not be required to repay any amounts received  but would also not realize any cash proceeds from the collection of additional receivables sold under the program prior to termination 
accounts receivable as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets would increase as new sales were made  and  after the qspe s obligations to the third party were satisfied  the note receivable would decrease as sold receivables were collected 
these factors would result in a decrease in reported cash flow from operations beginning in the period of termination and continuing in subsequent periods until the sold receivables were collected 
the company might need to borrow from its existing credit facilities or use available cash to make up the difference in cash generated from accounts receivable until collections from new accounts not sold under the program begin to be received 
the company currently anticipates its consolidated tax rate in will not exceed before any discrete items  although there can be no assurance that this will not change 
at december   the company s order backlog was million  an increase of approximately from the prior year end 
the increase was partially due to the effect of changes in currency translation rates 
as discussed above under industry trends  since major consolidation and capacity rationalization in the paper industry appears to be largely completed  the company expects the negative impact of these trends on pmc demand in future periods will be minimized 
nevertheless  if these trends were to continue  they could have a negative impact on net sales as well as on cash flow from operations 
the company will continue to focus on improving the performance of its products and improving its product mix and price structure  while at the same time identifying additional cost saving opportunities 
in any event  although historical cash flows may not  for all of these reasons  necessarily be indicative of future cash flows  the company expects to continue to be able to generate substantial cash from sales of its products and services in future periods 
in january  the company entered into an unsecured five year million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks 
under the agreement  the company pays a fee of on the unused portion of the commitment  and pays interest  at variable rates based on libor  plus a spread  on the drawn portion 
the spread is determined by the company s leverage ratio  as defined in the agreement 
the agreement includes a number of covenants that could limit the company s ability to purchase common stock  pay dividends  acquire other companies or dispose of its assets  and also requires the company to maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than to  and a minimum interest coverage of at least to 
the company may purchase its common stock or pay dividends to the extent its leverage ratio remains at or below to  and may make acquisitions provided its leverage ratio would not exceed to after giving pro forma effect to the acquisition 
if any bank in the lending group is unable to meet its commitment to lend  the company may be unable to borrow the full amount 
the company does not expect that any of the banks in the bank group will be unable to meet their commitments 
the company s ability to borrow additional amounts under the credit agreement is conditional upon the absence of any defaults as well as the absence of any material adverse change 
as of december   the company s leverage ratio under the agreement was to  and the interest coverage ratio was to 
as of december   borrowings under the principal loan agreement were million  and total long term debt was million 
the majority of other long term indebtedness represented debt under industrial revenue financings in the united states see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
based on the maximum leverage ratio  the company  as of december   would have been able to borrow an additional million under the principal loan agreement 
the company also had short term indebtedness of million at december  the company is the owner and beneficiary of life insurance policies on certain present and former employees 
the company reports the cash surrender value of life insurance  net of any outstanding loans  as a separate noncurrent asset 
the year end cash surrender value of life insurance policies was million in  million in  and million in the rate of return on the policies varies with market conditions and was approximately in  in and is expected to be approximately in the company may convert the cash surrender value of these policies to cash at any time  by either surrendering the policies or borrowing against the cash value of the policies 
in  the company used million of cash to repay all outstanding loans against the policies 
there were no borrowings against the life insurance policies during or capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in capital expenditures in and included amounts related to a new facility in france as well as capacity and efficiency improvements at the company s plant in finland 
the company estimates capital expenditure requirements of about million in such expenditures would be for replacement of equipment  upgrades for efficiency improvements and extension of asset lives  as well as to support safety and environmental requirements and the expansion of capacity in accordance with the company s business strategies 
as with previous capital spending  the company expects to fund future capital spending from cash from operations and existing credit facilities 
cash dividends per share increased from in  to in  to in dividends payable as of december  and  were million and million  respectively 
dividends have been declared each quarter since the fourth quarter of decisions with respect to whether a dividend will be paid  and the amount of the dividend  are made by the board of directors each quarter 
to the extent the board declares cash dividends in the future  the company would expect to pay such dividends out of operating cash flow 
future cash dividends will be dependent on debt covenants and on the board s assessment of the company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows 
in january  the board authorized the purchase of  shares of class a common stock  in the open market or otherwise  at such prices as management may from time to time consider to be advantageous to the company s shareholders 
since january  the company has purchased  shares of its class a common stock pursuant to this authorization  including  purchased in in july  the company purchased  shares of its class a common stock in a private transaction 
the authorization given by the board for this purchase was separate from the authorization given in the total cost of treasury shares purchased in was million 
in november  the board authorized the purchase of up to  additional shares of its class a common stock 
as of december   the company remains authorized to purchase  shares without further announcement 
as of december   the company had accrued restructuring liabilities of million 
the company anticipates that cash payments for restructuring will be approximately million in  million in  and million thereafter 
as of december   the company had the following cash flow obligations payments due by period in millions total less than one year one to three years three to five years after five years total debt interest payments a pension plan contributions b other postretirement benefits c restructuring accruals other noncurrent liabilities d operating leases a the terms of variable rate debt arrangements  including interest rates and maturities  are included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company used interest rate swap agreements to fix the rate of interest on million of variable rate debt at through the maturity of the swaps in june and august making the assumption that the company maintains million of variable rate debt until the swaps mature  and no changes in variable interest rates occur  the company would expect to incur additional interest on that debt of approximately million in and an additional million of interest on other debt 
estimates of interest on the million beyond the maturity of the swaps is not provided due to many factors that could affect the reliability of those estimates 
the company expects variable interest rates to change in future periods  but cannot predict the nature  timing  or magnitude of such changes 
b the company s largest pension plan is in the united states 
although no contributions are currently required  the company s planned contribution of million in is included in this schedule and  additionally  million is included for plans outside of the united states 
the amount of contributions after is subject to many variables including return of pension plan assets  interest rates  and tax and employee benefit laws 
therefore  contributions beyond are not included in this schedule 
c estimated payments for other postretirement benefits for the next five years is based on the assumption that employer cash payments will increase by after no estimate of the payments after five years has been made due to many uncertainties 
d estimated payments for deferred compensation and other noncurrent liabilities of million are not included in this table due to the uncertain timing of the ultimate cash settlement 
the foregoing table should not be deemed to represent all of the company s future cash requirements  which will vary based upon the company s future needs 
while the cash required to satisfy the obligations set forth in the table is reasonably determinable in advance  many other cash needs such as raw materials costs  payroll and taxes are dependent on future events and are harder to predict 
in addition  while the contingencies described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements are not currently anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the company  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
subject to the foregoing  the company currently expects that cash from operations and the other sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to enable it to meet the foregoing cash obligations  as well as to meet its other cash requirements
