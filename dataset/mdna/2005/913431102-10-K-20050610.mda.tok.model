the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  and the notes thereto  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
see part i 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
overview general we provide a full range of natural gas compression services  including sales  operations  maintenance and fabrication services and products to the natural gas industry  both domestically and internationally 
through our core business  contract compression  and our fleet as of march  of approximately  compressor units comprising approximately million horsepower  we provide natural gas compression to domestic and international customers 
through our equipment fabrication business we design  engineer and assemble natural gas compressors for sale to third parties and for use in our contract compression fleet 
through our aftermarket services business  we sell parts and components and provide maintenance and operations services to customers who own their compression equipment or use equipment provided by other companies 
these services and products are essential to the natural gas industry as gas must be compressed to be delivered from the wellhead to end users and  sometimes in the case of declining reservoir pressure  in order to get to the wellhead itself 
our customers consist primarily of domestic and international oil and gas companies  international state owned oil and gas companies  large and small independent producers and natural gas processors  gatherers and pipelines 
generally  our overall business activity and revenue increase as the demand for natural gas increases 
in the united states  increases in the demand for compression services and products are driven by growth in the production of natural gas  by declining reservoir pressure in maturing natural gas producing fields and  more recently  by increased demand for compression equipment for growing non conventional natural gas production  from places such as coal bed methane  tight sands and shale gas 
in international markets  increases in the demand for compression services and products are driven by growth in natural gas industry infrastructure  environmental initiatives encouraging the production and consumption of natural gas and the growth in the worldwide transportation and use of natural gas 
the demand for compression services is also driven by general increases in the demand for energy fuel stocks  including natural gas  which is generally driven by economic growth  and by increases in the outsourcing of compression needs 
industry conditions and trends natural gas industry 
worldwide consumption of natural gas increased from approximately trillion cubic feet in to approximately trillion cubic feet in  although consumption levels in the united states declined in the early s primarily due to an economic slowdown and continue to be relatively flat 
industry sources expect the long term growth trend of worldwide gas consumption to continue 
we believe the growing demand in electrical power generation is a contributing factor in the worldwide growth of natural gas consumption as natural gas tends to be the fuel of choice for new power plants 
the united states accounted for an estimated annual production of approximately trillion cubic feet of natural gas in calendar year  or of the worldwide total  compared to an estimated annual production of approximately trillion cubic feet in the rest of the world 
industry sources estimate that the united states relative natural gas production level will decrease to approximately of worldwide production by calendar year as of january   the united states natural gas reserves were estimate at trillion cubic feet  or of the worldwide total 
natural gas compression services industry 
the natural gas compression services industry experienced a significant increase in the demand for its products and services from the early s to the early s 
the amount of compression horsepower currently operated by contract compression providers  such as the company  is estimated to be approximately million to million horsepower in the united states and approximately million horsepower internationally 
a high level of compression industry capital expenditures and reduced demand due to lackluster economic activity resulted in reduced contract compression fleet utilization beginning in late calendar and continued into calendar industry utilization stabilized in the second half of calendar and began to increase during calendar as a result of reduced capital expenditures and increasing demand due to improving economic activity 
during calendar the industry did not materially increase the supply of contract compression units in the united states due to an emphasis on the redeployment of idle units while growth in international markets continued 
during calendar  the industry began to increase capital expenditure levels in the united states as increasing utilization levels caused a shortage in the supply of available  large horsepower units  while international growth continued 
we believe the outlook for contract compression services  particularly in the united states  will continue to benefit from aging producing natural gas fields which will require more compression to continue producing the same volume of natural gas  and from increasing production from unconventional sources  which include tight sands  shale and coal bed methane  which generally require more compression than production from conventional sources to produce the same volume of natural gas 
while the international gas compression services market is currently smaller than the domestic market  we believe there are growth opportunities in international demand for compression services and products due to the following factors implementation of international environmental and conservation laws preventing the practice of flaring natural gas and recognition of natural gas as a clean air fuel  a desire by a number of oil exporting nations to replace oil with natural gas as a fuel source in local markets to allow greater export of oil  increasing development of pipeline infrastructure  particularly in latin america and asia  necessary to transport natural gas to local markets  growing demand for electrical power generation  for which the fuel of choice tends to be natural gas  and privatization of state owned energy producers  resulting in increased outsourcing due to the focus on reducing capital expenditures and enhancing cash flow and profitability 
company performance trends and outlook during fiscal and fiscal  we increased our natural gas compression fleet  expanded fabrication capabilities for large horsepower units  added complementary aftermarket services and broadened our international operations 
capital expenditures in fiscal and fiscal were significantly lower than fiscal levels as we emphasized the redeployment of idle fleet units 
in fiscal we began to increase our compression fleet investment  both through acquisition and fabrication of fleet units  in light of the growing demand for contract compression services and average fleet utilization rates consistently in the mid to upper range 
for fiscal year  we expect continued increased activity in all business segments 
we expect continued strong demand in the contract compression segments to support an average utilization rate in the high to range  as well as a stable price environment 
while domestic contract compression margins are expected to stay within its historical range  we expect our international contract compression gross margin to continue to trend modestly lower toward the mid range 
customer demand is expected to support continued revenue growth in our aftermarket services segment 
we expect aftermarket services gross margins to remain within its historical range 
we further expect customer demand to support improved margins in our fabrication segment  although revenue in fabrication is likely to be lower in fiscal year than in fiscal year as we seek to improve our profitability in this segment through a combination of process improvements and increased pricing to compensate for risks inherent in certain complex jobs 
with respect to process improvements  we began instituting our lean manufacturing initiative in march  focusing on keeping inventories low and streamlining how a unit moves through the fabrication plant and how it is tested 
challenges and uncertainties demand 
the demand for and production of natural gas  the price environment and the level of investment by our customers in their natural gas assets may not remain at their current levels or continue to grow as expected  and a substantial decline in any of those factors would  in all likelihood  result in a decline in the demand for our compression services and products 
competition 
the natural gas contract compression  fabrication and aftermarket services businesses are highly competitive 
we face several competitors in all business segments 
in addition  the barriers to entry are minimal in the fabrication and aftermarket services business  as well as in the lower horsepower ranges in the contract compression business 
we face competition from some of our suppliers and their distributors in the aftermarket services business  as they have alternative distribution channels 
we also face competition  indirectly  from our customers in the contract compression business since our customers retain the ability to purchase their equipment  thus reducing the market for contract compression 
these competitive factors keep constant pressure on our market share  and  therefore  revenue and profit margins 
although we believe that we compete effectively on the basis of customer service  price  technical expertise  geographic scope  quality and reliability  maintaining our competitiveness will require effective execution of our business strategies 
international expansion 
we intend to continue to pursue growth for our compression services in international markets 
while  currently  approximately percent of our revenues are derived from the united states and percent internationally  we anticipate the percentage of our revenues derived from international operations will increase in the future 
while this planned growth in international operations is anticipated to result in increased gross margins relative to our current domestic gross margins  the expansion will likely also result in higher selling  general and administrative expenses as we grow our international infrastructure and will increase our exposure to the risks inherent in international operations  including political and economic instability  foreign exchange rate risks and the other international risk factors described below in the risk factors section of this item of this report 
fiscal financial highlights some of the more significant financial items for the fiscal year  which are discussed below in financial results of operations  were as follows net income 
net income for the fiscal year ended march  increased compared to the prior year by million  or 
higher revenue 
total revenue was higher by million  or  for the fiscal year ended march  due primarily to higher levels of activity across all four of our business segments 
debt extinguishment costs 
we incurred debt extinguishment costs of million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily related to the fiscal fourth quarter debt refinancing 
debt extinguishment costs consisted of premium costs of million and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of million 
lower interest expense 
compared to the prior fiscal year  interest expense was lower by million  or  primarily from the reduction of principal on certain higher interest rate debt and the lowering of interest rates resulting from debt refinancings and the entering into of interest rate swap agreements 
higher depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  due primarily to the start of operations of a project in brazil and other capital additions 
higher selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a increased by million  or due primarily to our on going investment in our international infrastructure  growing international revenue taxes  which are classified as sg a  continued costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  and costs associated with the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning erp system 
gain on termination of interest rate swap agreements 
included within net income for the fiscal year ended march  is a million gain on the termination of interest rate swap agreements related to the repayment of debt in june asset impairment 
included within net income for the fiscal year ended march  is a million loss on the impairment of our tulsa  oklahoma fabrication facility 
fiscal operating highlights the following table summarizes total available horsepower  average contracted horsepower  horsepower utilization percentages and fabrication backlog 
for the year ended march  horsepower in thousands total available horsepower at period end domestic contract compression   international contract compression total   average contracted horsepower domestic contract compression   international contract compression total   horsepower utilization spot at period end average as of march  in millions fabrication backlog domestic available horsepower remained relatively stable for year ended march  compared to the prior year 
the increase in international horsepower was primarily attributable to horsepower that was added in latin america in response to higher customer demand and the canadian acquisition in november  which is discussed below in acquisitions 
domestic average contracted horsepower increased by for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to higher customer demand 
international average contracted horsepower increased by for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
like the increase in total available international horsepower  this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition that was made in canada and higher customer demand in latin america 
fabrication backlog decreased million or as of march  compared to march  fabrication backlog fluctuates period to period due to  among other things  the timing of receipt of orders placed by customers and the timing of revenue recognition 
the backlog of fabrication projects at june  was approximately million 
a majority of the backlog is expected to be completed within a day period 
acquisitions in november  we purchased the canadian contract compression fleet of hanover compressor company  for million in cash 
at the time of the acquisition  the acquired fleet totaled approximately  horsepower and was expected to generate annual revenue of approximately million 
however  following the subsequent sale of approximately  horsepower from the fleet  the expected annual revenue is estimated to be approximately million 
the acquisition was funded by million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and million in cash 
we continue to expect this transaction will be accretive to our earnings per share during the first full year of operations 
we further expanded our international sales and service footprint by acquiring two small service companies in venezuela and brazil during fiscal year financial results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  the following table summarizes revenue  gross profit  gross margin  expenses and the respective percentages for each of our business segments year ended march  dollars in thousands revenue domestic contract compression   of revenue international contract compression   of revenue fabrication   of revenue aftermarket services   of revenue total revenue   gross profit domestic contract compression   international contract compression   fabrication   aftermarket services   total gross profit   gross margin domestic contract compression international contract compression fabrication aftermarket services total gross margin expenses depreciation and amortization   selling  general and administrative   interest expense  net   debt extinguishment costs   foreign currency gain loss other income  net   gain on termination of interest rate swap agreements  asset impairment expense  facility consolidation costs  income taxes   net income   revenue 
the higher revenue for the fiscal year ended march   is attributable to increased industry activity and customer demand  which resulted in higher utilization in both the domestic and international contract compression fleets and increased sales in the fabrication and aftermarket services businesses 
specifically  domestic contract compression revenue increased due primarily to higher average contract prices and increased contracted horsepower in the fiscal year ended march  international contract compression revenue increased primarily as a result of additional revenue from the canadian acquisition discussed above  additional compression business in argentina and additional revenue from a project in brazil  which contributed to increases of million  million and million  respectively 
fabrication revenue increased due to increased customer demand in the united states  asia pacific and latin america regions  which contributed increases of million  million and million  respectively 
this increased revenue contribution was partially offset by a decline in fabrication revenue in canada of million 
aftermarket services revenue was higher primarily due to increases within latin america million and asia pacific million due  in part  to small acquisitions made in these regions 
additionally  aftermarket service revenue in the united states increased million due to higher customer demand 
gross profit 
the changes in contract compression gross profit defined as total revenue less direct costs for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year were primarily attributable to revenue increases discussed above for domestic contract compression and international contract compression  which offset the somewhat higher maintenance expenses experienced domestically toward the end of the fiscal year  including lubricant costs  fuel costs and field wages 
the decreased gross profit experienced in fabrication despite the increased revenues was primarily due to warranty costs and cost overruns experienced on certain relatively complex projects 
aftermarket services gross profit was lower despite increased revenues due to  among other things  some year end pricing adjustments for an alliance customer 
gross margin 
as a percentage of segment revenue  direct costs for all business segments combined for fiscal year ended march  remained relatively stable compared to the prior year  although gross margins for our fabrication and aftermarket service segments were lower due to the above mentioned increases in direct costs 
depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year primarily resulted from the start of operations of a project in brazil up million and other capital additions  primarily overhauls  which resulted in an increase in depreciation of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  relates to the increased expenses  resulting from increased operating activity within latin america and asia pacific  of million and million  respectively 
additionally  expenses within the united states increased million due primarily to compliance with sarbanes oxley and on going implementation of a new erp system 
selling  general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues for both periods 
interest expense  net 
the decrease in interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  is primarily related to the company s debt refinancing activities during the past two fiscal years 
the company s million reduction in the amount outstanding under the asset backed securitization lease facility the abs facility from june to february lowered interest expense by million 
the lower interest rates resulting from the refinancing of million of long term debt in february reduced interest expense by million 
finally  the refinancing of million of long term debt in may lowered interest expense by million 
debt extinguishment costs 
for the fiscal year ended march   debt extinguishment costs were primarily due to the early extinguishment of our term loan due and senior notes due as a result of the early extinguishment of debt  a charge of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year resulting from the call premium of million and write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of million 
the debt extinguishment costs of million included in the prior year results primarily related to the may refinancing  and consisted of premium costs of million  the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of million and million in transaction expenses 
gain on termination of interest rate swap agreements 
a million gain on the termination of interest rate swap agreements was recognized for the fiscal year ended march  this gain was the result of reducing the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements by million on our abs facility in connection with a principal reduction of million in june asset impairment 
included within net income for the fiscal year ended march  is a million loss on the impairment of our  square foot tulsa  oklahoma fabrication facility 
with the fabrication difficulties experienced over the past couple of quarters  including cost overruns on certain complex fabrication jobs  we undertook a significant analysis of our fabrication assets and business  and made a decision to permanently discontinue operations and dispose of our tulsa fabrication facility 
the carrying value of this facility was written down to its estimated market value  which was determined by the company based upon recent appraisals 
facility consolidation costs 
facility consolidation costs incurred during the fiscal year ended march  were million 
these costs related to the transfer of the tulsa  oklahoma fabrication operations to the houston  texas fabrication facility and were primarily for severance  personnel costs and relocation costs 
the company does not expect to incur additional facility consolidation costs during the two year period ending september  fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  the following table summarizes revenue  gross profit  gross margin  expenses and the respective percentages for each of our business segments year ended march  dollars in thousands revenue domestic contract compression   of revenue international contract compression   of revenue fabrication   of revenue aftermarket services   of revenue total revenue   gross profit domestic contract compression   international contract compression   fabrication   aftermarket services   total gross profit   gross margin domestic contract compression international contract compression fabrication aftermarket services total gross margin expenses depreciation and amortization   selling  general and administrative   operating lease expense  interest expense  net   debt extinguishment costs  foreign currency gain loss other income  net   facility consolidation costs  income taxes   net income   revenue 
total revenue increases were realized across all business segments for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year 
domestic contract compression revenue increased due to higher average contract rates and improved utilization  both of which contributed equally to the increase 
international contract compression revenue increased primarily as a result of additional compression business in brazil and argentina  which contributed increases of million and million  respectively 
fabrication revenue increased due to additional projects for customers in our united states and canadian regions resulting in increases of million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by declines in the asia pacific region of million and the latin american region of million 
aftermarket services revenue was higher due primarily to increased customer demand in the united states million  canada million and asia pacific million 
gross profit 
the changes to gross profit defined as total revenues less direct costs for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year were primarily attributable to revenue increases discussed above for domestic contract compression  international contract compression and aftermarket services 
fabrication gross profit decreased due to higher costs in the first fiscal quarter primarily as a result of cost overruns related to several highly customized fabrication projects for customers in the asia pacific region 
gross margin 
as a percentage of segment revenue  direct costs for all business segments for fiscal year ended march  remained relatively stable compared to the prior year  with the exception of fabrication  which experienced lower margins as a result of the cost overruns discussed above 
depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year resulted from on going capital additions which increased depreciation by approximately million and the inclusion of additional compression equipment on the balance sheet as of december  due to the consolidation of the operating lease facilities 
depreciation expense related to this equipment began january  and was partially offset by the change in estimated useful lives of the compressor fleet discussed below 
the combined impact of the consolidation of the compressor equipment in the operating lease facilities and the extension of the useful lives of the compressor fleet at december  increased depreciation expense by approximately million 
in fiscal  we evaluated the estimated economic useful lives used for book depreciation purposes for our compressor fleet based upon equipment type  key components and industry experience of the actual economic useful life in the field 
the evaluation was finalized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based upon the findings of the evaluation  the estimated useful lives of the majority of the existing compressor units were extended to years from years 
in addition  a portion of the units remained at the previous years or less and a portion of the units were extended to years 
the change in economic useful lives was effective january  combined operating lease expense and interest expense  net 
taking into account the effect of the consolidation of the lease facilities on december   the combined operating lease expense and interest expense  net  for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by million  or compared to the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to may refinancing activities  which reduced outstanding long term debt by approximately million and lowered the interest rate on million of indebtedness to from 
interest expense decreased million as a result of the million reduction in debt and decreased million due to the lower interest rate on the million of indebtedness 
operating lease expense 
as a result of the consolidation of the lease facilities  there was no operating lease expense related to the operating lease facilities during the fiscal year ended march  the operating lease expense related to the operating lease facilities has been recognized as interest expense subsequent to the consolidation of the lease facilities on december  interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  increased for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year primarily due to the consolidation of the operating lease facilities as of december  which resulted in the classification of operating lease expense subsequent to december  as interest expense 
debt extinguishment costs 
debt extinguishment costs incurred during the fiscal year ended march  were primarily due to the early extinguishment of universal s outstanding million senior discount notes due in may the net proceeds from the offering by universal of new senior discount notes due and available funds were used to pay for the extinguishment of the senior discount notes due as a result of the early extinguishment of debt  a charge of million was recognized resulting from the redemption and tender premiums of million  write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of million and million of other costs 
additional debt extinguishment costs of million resulted from the buyback of million of our senior notes during the three months ended march  facility consolidation costs 
facility consolidation costs related to the transfer of the tulsa  oklahoma fabrication operations to the houston  texas fabrication facility were million during the year ended march  these costs were primarily for severance  personnel costs and relocation costs 
the company does not expect to incur additional facility consolidation costs during the two year period ending september  effects of inflation in recent years  inflation has been modest and has not had a material impact upon the results of our operations  nor do we currently have reason to believe it will have a material impact in the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash are operating activities and financing activities 
our primary uses of cash are operating expenditures  capital expenditures and long term debt repayments 
the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the fiscal years ended march  and  and our cash and working capital as of the end of such periods year ended march  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities   investing activities   financing activities   as of march  in thousands cash   working capital  net of cash   overview 
net cash used in investing and financing activities exceeded net cash provided by operating activities by million for the fiscal year ended march  primarily as a result of million paid for acquisitions  million in net debt prepayments during the period and million of capital expenditures  as discussed below 
as a result  the cash balance of million at march  declined to million at march  for the fiscal year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities exceeded cash used in investing and financing activities by million 
operations 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of changes in working capital including higher billing activity for all business segments at the end of the year compared to fiscal capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended march  were million consisting of million for fleet additions  million for compressor overhauls  million for service trucks and million for machinery  equipment  information technology equipment and other items 
based on current market conditions  we expect to continue to invest in fleet additions  compressor overhauls and maintenance and other capital requirements 
we expect net capital expenditures defined as capital expenditure less proceeds from asset sales of approximately million to million for the fiscal year ending march   including approximately million for compression fleet maintenance capital 
long term debt 
as of march   we had approximately million in outstanding debt obligations consisting primarily of million outstanding under the seven year term loan  million outstanding of senior notes due may  million outstanding under the abs facility and million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the maturities of this debt are shown below 
we expect to pay these principal payments through cash generated by operations and debt refinancing activity 
in thousands thereafter  total debt  in january  the company closed a million senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders and financial institutions consisting of a million five year revolving line of credit and a million seven year term loan 
the company used approximately million  under the new credit facility  together with million  under the abs facility  to repay and redeem the outstanding million under the company s high yield operating lease facility and repay million in debt under the company s now terminated revolving credit facility 
we intend to utilize the additional capacity under the new credit facility for working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
in connection with this repayment and redemption  the company recorded million in debt extinguishment costs  including approximately million in redemption premiums and an approximately million write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
in january  the company also entered into forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge million of the new million seven year term loan 
the interest rate swap agreements convert variable interest payments to fixed interest payments and terminate in march historically  we have financed capital expenditures with net cash provided by operations and financing activities 
based on current market conditions  we expect that net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to finance our operating expenditures  capital expenditures and scheduled interest and debt repayments through the fiscal year 
to the extent that net cash provided by operating activities is not sufficient to finance our operating expenditures  capital expenditures and scheduled interest and debt repayments through the fiscal year  we may borrow additional funds under our new revolving line of credit or we may obtain additional debt or equity financing 
debt covenants and availability 
covenants in our credit facilities require that we maintain various financial ratios  including a collateral coverage ratio market value of domestic compression collateral to amount of indebtedness outstanding under our new credit facility of greater than or equal to to  a total leverage ratio total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense of less than or equal to to  and an interest coverage ratio earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense to interest expense of greater than or equal to to as of march   we and our subsidiaries were in compliance with all of the financial covenants 
as of march   after giving effect to million of outstanding letters of credit under our financing documents  we had an aggregate unused credit availability of approximately million from our revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our cash contractual obligations as of march  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years total debt      estimated interest payments     capital leases  purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations    amounts represent the expected cash payments for principal on our total debt and do not include any deferred issuance costs or fair market valuation of our current interest rate swap agreements 
interest amounts calculated using the interest rates in effect as of march   including the effect of interest rate swaps 
amounts represent the expected cash payments under capital lease obligations 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepare these financial statements in conformity with gaap 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the accounting policies we believe require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position are as follows allowances and reserves our customers are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of credit 
we maintain an allowance for bad debts based on specific customer collection issues and historical experience 
on an on going basis  we conduct an evaluation of the financial strength of our customers based on payment history and make adjustments to the allowance as necessary 
we record a reserve against our inventory balance for estimated obsolescence 
this reserve is based on specific identification and historical experience 
we accrue amounts for estimated warranty claims based upon current and historical product warranty costs and any other related information known to us 
depreciation property  plant and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation for financial reporting purposes is computed on the straight line basis using estimated useful lives 
for compression equipment  depreciation begins with the first compression service using a salvage value 
business combinations and goodwill goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations represent the excess of consideration over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as in determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
we perform an impairment test for goodwill assets annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
our goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units with their carrying value 
the fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and other market related valuation models 
certain estimates and judgments are required in the application of the fair value models 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we performed an impairment analysis in accordance with sfas no 
and determined that no impairment had occurred  however  if for any reason the fair value of our goodwill or that of any of our reporting units declines below the carrying value in the future  we may incur charges for the impairment 
long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment  definite lived intangibles and other assets comprise a significant amount of our total assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used by us are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets to be held and used  we base our evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  we determine whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis 
if an impairment has occurred  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  is based on an estimate of discounted cash flows 
self insurance we are self insured up to certain levels for general liability  vehicle liability  group medical and for workers compensation claims for certain of our employees 
we record self insurance accruals based on claims filed and an estimate for significant claims incurred but not reported 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through insurance reserves 
although we believe adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  it is reasonably possible our estimates of these liabilities will change over the near term as circumstances develop 
income taxes we provide a wide range of services to a global market and as such  are subject to taxation not only in the united states but also in numerous foreign jurisdictions 
the determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws  tax treaties  and tax authority practices and procedures in each jurisdiction 
changes in the operating environment including changes in tax law could impact our estimate of tax liabilities in a given year 
the realizablity of our deferred tax assets or the need for associated valuation allowances is reliant upon our estimates of future taxable income and the reversal of tax advantaged temporary differences  such as accelerated depreciation 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including assumptions on future operating conditions and asset utilization 
the judgments and assumptions used to determine future taxable income are consistent with those used for other financial statement purposes 
another item that affects income taxes is the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
the assumptions related to this permanent reinvestment are analyzed and reviewed annually for changes in our international and domestic business outlook 
the american jobs creations act of introduced a provision allowing an dividends received deduction for certain foreign earnings repatriated to a united states taxpayer 
based on our analysis of the existing language in the act  we do not expect to utilize the deduction by repatriating undistributed earnings

with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the act on a company s income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
fsp states that a company is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 
we have not yet decided on whether  and to what extent  we might elect to repatriate foreign earnings under the provisions in the act 
any such repatriation under the act must occur by december  accordingly  our consolidated financial statements do not reflect a provision for taxes related to this election 
risk factors as described in part i 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements  this report contains forward looking statements regarding us  our business and our industry 
the risk factors described below  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted 
we depend on strong demand for natural gas and a prolonged  substantial reduction in this demand would adversely affect the demand for our services and products 
gas contract compression operations are significantly dependent upon the demand for natural gas 
demand may be affected by  among other factors  natural gas prices  weather  demand for energy and availability of alternative energy sources 
any prolonged  substantial reduction in the demand for natural gas would  in all likelihood  depress the level of production  exploration and development activity and result in a decline in the demand for our contract compression services and products 
similarly  a decrease in capital spending by our customers could result in reduced demand for our fabrication and aftermarket services businesses 
our international operations subject us to risks that are difficult to predict 
for the fiscal year ended march   we derived approximately of our revenues from international operations 
we intend to continue to expand our business in latin america  asia pacific and  ultimately  other international markets 
this may make it more difficult for us to manage our business 
reasons for this include  but are not limited to  the following political and economic instability in foreign markets  foreign governments restrictive trade policies  inconsistent product regulation or sudden policy changes by foreign agencies or governments  the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws  the imposition of duties  taxes or government royalties  foreign exchange rate risks  difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable  potentially longer payment cycles  increased costs in maintaining international manufacturing and marketing efforts  the introduction of non tariff barriers and higher duty rates  difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations  restrictions on repatriation of earnings or expropriation of property  and the geographic  time zone  language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world 
any of these factors may cause us to experience economic loss or negatively impact our earnings or net assets 
we face significant competition that may cause us to lose market share and harm our financial performance 
the contract compression  fabrication  and aftermarket services businesses are highly competitive and there are low barriers to entry for individual projects 
in addition  some of our competitors are large national and multinational companies that provide contract compression and fabrication services to third parties  some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
if our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive products and services  we may not be able to compete effectively 
we are dependent on particular suppliers and are vulnerable to product shortages and price increases 
as a consequence of having a highly standardized contract compression fleet  some of the components used in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on these suppliers involves several risks  including price increases  inferior component quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner 
the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have a negative impact on our results of operations and could damage our customer relationships 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
we do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities 
natural gas service operations are subject to inherent risks such as equipment defects  malfunction and failures  and natural disasters that can result in uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids  fires and explosions 
these risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury  death  property damage  pollution and other environmental damages 
although we have obtained insurance against many of these risks  our insurance may be inadequate to cover our liabilities 
further  insurance covering the risks we face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or  if available  the premiums may not be commercially justifiable 
if we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits  or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
the sale of stock by weatherford  which currently owns approximately of our common stock  may depress our stock price 
weatherford international ltd 
or weatherford may sell up to  of its shares of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement that we filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the sale of substantial amounts of our stock owned by weatherford in the public market  or the belief that these sales may occur  could reduce the market price of our stock  making it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our common stock and to acquire businesses using our stock as consideration 
weatherford s current stock ownership allows it to designate three directors to our board 
the combination of weatherford s voting power and the number of appointed directors gives it the ability to exercise substantial control over the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
weatherford s interests could conflict with our other stockholders 
currently  weatherford owns  shares  or approximately  of our outstanding common stock 
in addition to its voting power  weatherford and its affiliates are entitled to designate three persons to serve on our board of directors for so long as they own at least of our outstanding common stock 
if weatherford s ownership falls below  weatherford may designate only two directors 
if weatherford s ownership falls below  it will no longer have the right to designate directors to our board 
this significant stock ownership and board representation gives weatherford the ability to exercise substantial influence over our ownership  policies  management and affairs and significant control over actions requiring approval of our stockholders 
weatherford s interests could conflict with our other stockholders 
we are highly leveraged 
a significant portion of our cash flow must be used to service our obligations  and we are vulnerable to interest rate increases 
we have now and will continue to have a significant amount of debt 
as of march   we had approximately million in outstanding debt obligations consisting primarily of million outstanding under our seven year term loan  million outstanding of our senior notes due  million outstanding under the asset backed securitization lease facility the abs facility and million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
this amount excludes approximately million of letters of credit  as of march  issued under our senior secured credit facility 
as of march   approximately million of our outstanding debt bore interest at floating rates 
changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates  thereby increasing our interest expense and reducing our funds available to make payments of interest and principal on the notes and for capital investment  operations or other purposes 
our significant leverage increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
our credit facilities impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
our credit facilities include certain covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to borrow money  create liens  other than liens securing our senior secured credit facility  the abs facility or in connection with permitted acquisitions  make investments  other than in any subsidiary or in connection with permitted acquisitions  declare dividends or make certain distributions  sell or dispose of property  and merge into or consolidate with any third party or sell or transfer all or substantially all of our property 
as of march   we were also required by our credit facilities to maintain various financial ratios  including a collateral coverage ratio market value of compression collateral to amount of indebtedness outstanding under our senior secured credit facility of greater than or equal to to  a total leverage ratio total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense of less than or equal to to  and an interest coverage ratio earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense to interest expense of greater than or equal to to as of june   we were in compliance with all of these financial covenants 
these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies 
our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the credit facilities may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance  changes in business conditions or results of operation  adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our debt  which could cause those obligations to become due and payable 
if any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated  we may not be able to repay or refinance it 
we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the foreign markets in which we operate 
a decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the us dollar could reduce our profits from foreign operations and the value of our foreign net assets 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
the majority of the company s foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency and  as such  gains and losses resulting from financial statement translation of foreign operations are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity 
gains and losses from balances that are receivable or payable in currency other than functional currency are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
as a result  the us dollar value of our foreign operations has varied  and will continue to vary  with exchange rate fluctuations 
in this respect  historically we have been primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the brazilian real  thai baht  mexican peso  australian dollar and canadian dollar against the us dollar 
a decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the us dollar could reduce our profits from foreign operations and the value of the net assets of our foreign operations when reported in us dollars in our financial statements 
this could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations as reported in us dollars 
in addition  fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period to period comparisons of our reported results of operations 
for purposes of accounting  the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations  where the local currency is the functional currency  are translated using period end exchange rates  and the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated using average exchange rates during each period 
although we attempt to match costs and revenues in local currencies  we anticipate that there may be instances in which costs and revenues will not be matched with respect to currency denomination 
as a result  to the extent we continue our expansion on a global basis  we expect that increasing portions of our revenues  costs  assets and liabilities will be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency valuations 
we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
further  the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local or foreign currency  resulting in our inability to hedge against these risks 
our ability to manage our business effectively will be weakened if we lose key personnel 
we depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
the departure of any of our key personnel could have a significant negative effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace 
we do not maintain key man life insurance coverage with respect to our executive officers or key management personnel 
we are not aware of the upcoming retirement of any of our executive officers or senior management personnel 
we are subject to substantial environmental regulation  and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities 
we are subject to stringent and complex foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulatory standards  including laws and regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment  emission controls and other environmental protection and occupational health and safety concerns 
environmental laws and regulations may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering us liable for remediation costs  natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of  or conditions caused by  prior owners or operators or other third parties 
in addition  where contamination may be present  it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury  property damage and recovery of response costs 
remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations  and costs associated with new information  changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
we routinely deal with natural gas  oil and other petroleum products 
as a result of our fabrication and aftermarket services operations  we generate  manage and dispose of or recycle hazardous wastes and substances such as solvents  thinner  waste paint  waste oil  washdown wastes and sandblast material 
although it is our policy to use generally accepted operating and disposal practices in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on  under or from properties owned  leased or operated by us or on or under other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal 
these properties may be subject to investigatory  remediation and monitoring requirements under foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
nevertheless  the modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations  the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations  or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  which in turn could have a negative impact on us and other similarly situated service companies 
our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change in control would result in the purchase of your shares at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to you 
there are provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change in control would result in the purchase of your shares at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to you 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock  it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  such as a staggered board of directors and limitations on the removal of directors  no stockholder action by written consent  and on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
delaware corporation law may also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by our board of directors 
the new erp system implementation may encounter problems that would negatively impact our business 
we contracted with a third party vendor to assist us with the design and implementation of a new erp system  which will support substantially all of our operating and financial functions  including our business segment operations  fleet management  billing  estimating  customer management  vendor management  accounting and financial reporting systems 
we plan to implement this new erp system through fiscal year a significant implementation problem  if encountered  could negatively impact our business by disrupting our operations 
although we currently have no reason to believe that any such significant implementation problems will occur  there are inherent limitations in our ability to predict and plan for these risks and estimate the magnitude of their impact 
consequently  it is possible that the occurrence of a significant implementation problem could be material 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations universal compression  inc 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with universal s financial statements  and the notes thereto  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
see part i 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
financial results of operations 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  the following table summarizes revenue  gross profit  gross margin  expenses and the respective percentages for each of our business segments year ended march  dollars in thousands revenue domestic contract compression   of revenue international contract compression   of revenue fabrication   of revenue aftermarket services   of revenue total revenue   gross profit domestic contract compression   international contract compression   fabrication   aftermarket services   total gross profit   gross margin domestic contract compression international contract compression fabrication aftermarket services total gross margin expenses depreciation and amortization   selling  general and administrative   interest expense  net   debt extinguishment costs   foreign currency gain loss other income  net   gain on termination of interest rate swap agreements  asset impairment expense  facility consolidation costs  income taxes   net income   revenue 
the higher revenue for the fiscal year ended march   is attributable to increased industry activity and customer demand  which resulted in higher utilization in both the domestic and international contract compression fleets and increased sales in the fabrication and aftermarket services businesses 
specifically  domestic contract compression revenue increased due primarily to higher average contract prices and increased contracted horsepower in the fiscal year ended march  international contract compression revenue increased primarily as a result of additional revenue from the canadian acquisition discussed above  additional compression business in argentina and additional revenue from a project in brazil  which contributed to increases of million  million and million  respectively 
fabrication revenue increased due to increased customer demand in the united states  asia pacific and latin america regions  which contributed increases of million  million and million  respectively 
this increased revenue contribution was partially offset by a decline in fabrication revenue in canada of million 
aftermarket services revenue was higher primarily due to increases within latin america million and asia pacific million due  in part  to small acquisitions made in these regions 
additionally  aftermarket service revenue in the united states increased million due to higher customer demand 
gross profit 
the changes in contract compression gross profit defined as total revenue less direct costs for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year were primarily attributable to revenue increases discussed above for domestic contract compression and international contract compression  which offset the somewhat higher maintenance expenses experienced domestically toward the end of the fiscal year  including lubricant costs  fuel costs and field wages 
the decreased gross profit experienced in fabrication despite the increased revenues was primarily due to warranty costs and cost overruns experienced on certain relatively complex projects 
aftermarket services gross profit was lower despite increased revenues due to  among other things  some year end pricing adjustments for an alliance customer 
gross margin 
as a percentage of segment revenue  direct costs for all business segments combined for fiscal year ended march  remained relatively stable compared to the prior year  although gross margins for our fabrication and aftermarket service segments were lower due to the above mentioned increases in direct costs 
depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year primarily resulted from the start of operations of a project in brazil an increase of million and other capital additions  primarily overhauls  which resulted in an increase in depreciation of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  relates to the increased expenses  resulting from increased operating activity within latin america and asia pacific  of million and million  respectively 
additionally  expenses within the united states increased million due primarily to compliance with sarbanes oxley and on going implementation of a new erp system 
selling  general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues for both periods 
interest expense  net 
the decrease in interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  is primarily related to the company s debt refinancing activities during the past two fiscal years 
the company s million reduction in the amount outstanding under the asset backed securitization lease facility the abs facility from june to february lowered interest expense by million 
the lower interest rates resulting from the refinancing of million of long term debt in february reduced interest expense by million 
finally  the refinancing of million of long term debt in may lowered interest expense by million 
debt extinguishment costs 
for the fiscal year ended march   debt extinguishment costs were primarily due to the early extinguishment of our term loan due and senior notes due as a result of the early extinguishment of debt  a charge of was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year resulting from the call premium of million and write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of million 
the debt extinguishment costs of million included in the prior year results primarily related to the may refinancing  and consisted of premium costs of million  the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of million and million in transaction expenses 
gain on termination of interest rate swap agreements 
a million gain on the termination of interest rate swap agreements was recognized for the fiscal year ended march  this gain was the result of reducing the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements by million on our abs lease facility in connection with a principal reduction of million in june asset impairment 
included within net income for the fiscal year ended march  is a million loss on the impairment of our  square foot tulsa  oklahoma fabrication facility 
with the fabrication difficulties experienced over the past couple of quarters  including cost overruns on certain complex fabrication jobs  we undertook a significant analysis of our fabrication assets and business  and made a decision to permanently discontinue operations and dispose of our tulsa fabrication facility 
the carrying value of this facility was written down to its estimated market value  which was determined by the company based upon recent appraisals 
facility consolidation costs 
facility consolidation costs incurred during the fiscal year ended march  were million 
these costs related to the transfer of the tulsa  oklahoma fabrication operations to the houston  texas fabrication facility and were primarily for severance  personnel costs and relocation costs 
the company does not expect to incur additional facility consolidation costs during the two year period ending september  fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  the following table summarizes revenue  gross profit  gross margin  expenses and the respective percentages for each of our business segments year ended march  dollars in thousands revenue domestic contract compression   of revenue international contract compression   of revenue fabrication   of revenue aftermarket services   of revenue total revenue   gross profit domestic contract compression   international contract compression   fabrication   aftermarket services   total gross profit   gross margin domestic contract compression international contract compression fabrication aftermarket services total gross margin expenses depreciation and amortization   selling  general and administrative   operating lease expense  interest expense  net   debt extinguishment costs  foreign currency gain loss other income  net   facility consolidation costs  income taxes   net income   revenue 
total revenue increases were realized across all business segments for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year 
domestic contract compression revenue increased due to higher average contract rates and improved utilization  both of which contributed equally to the increase 
international contract compression revenue increased primarily as a result of additional compression business in brazil and argentina  which contributed increases of million and million  respectively 
fabrication revenue increased due to additional projects for customers in our united states and canadian regions resulting in increases of million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by declines in the asia pacific region of million and the latin american region of million 
revenue from fabrication fluctuates quarter to quarter due to the timing of receipt of orders placed by customers and due to the timing of recognition of revenue  which occurs at the time of shipment 
aftermarket services revenue was higher due primarily to increased customer demand in the united states million  canada million and asia pacific million 
gross profit 
the changes to gross profit defined as total revenues less direct costs for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year were primarily attributable to revenue increases discussed above for domestic contract compression  international contract compression and aftermarket services 
fabrication gross profit decreased due to higher costs in the first fiscal quarter primarily as a result of cost overruns related to several highly customized fabrication projects for customers in the asia pacific region 
gross margin 
as a percentage of segment revenue  direct costs for all business segments for fiscal year ended march  remained relatively stable compared to the prior year  with the exception of fabrication which experienced lower margins as a result of the cost overruns described above 
depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year resulted from on going capital additions which increased depreciation by approximately million and the inclusion of additional compression equipment on the balance sheet as of december  due to the consolidation of the operating lease facilities 
depreciation expense related to this equipment began january  and was partially offset by the change in estimated useful lives of the compressor fleet discussed below 
the combined impact of the consolidation of the compressor equipment in the operating lease facilities and the extension of the useful lives of the compressor fleet at december  increased depreciation expense by approximately million 
in fiscal  we evaluated the estimated economic useful lives used for book depreciation purposes for our compressor fleet based upon equipment type  key components and industry experience of the actual economic useful life in the field 
the evaluation was finalized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based upon the findings of the evaluation  the estimated useful lives of the majority of the existing compressor units were extended to years from years 
in addition  a portion of the units remained at the previous years or less and a portion of the units were extended to years 
the change in economic useful lives was effective january  combined operating lease expense and interest expense  net 
taking into account the effect of the consolidation of the lease facilities on december   the combined operating lease expense and interest expense  net  for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by million  or compared to the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to may refinancing activities  which reduced outstanding long term debt by approximately million and lowered the interest rate on million of indebtedness to from 
interest expense decreased million as a result of the million reduction in debt and decreased million due to the lower interest rate on the million of indebtedness 
operating lease expense 
as a result of the consolidation of the lease facilities  there was no operating lease expense related to the operating lease facilities during the fiscal year ended march  the operating lease expense related to the operating lease facilities has been recognized as interest expense subsequent to the consolidation of the lease facilities on december  interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  increased for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year primarily due to the consolidation of the operating lease facilities as of december  which resulted in the classification of operating lease expense subsequent to december  as interest expense 
debt extinguishment costs 
debt extinguishment costs incurred during the fiscal year ended march  were primarily due to the early extinguishment of universal s outstanding million senior discount notes due in may the net proceeds from the offering by universal of new senior discount notes due and available funds were used to pay for the extinguishment of the senior discount notes due as a result of the early extinguishment of debt  a charge of million was recognized resulting from the redemption and tender premiums of million  write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of million and million of other costs 
additional debt extinguishment costs of million resulted from the buyback of million of our senior notes during the three months ended march  facility consolidation costs 
facility consolidation costs related to the transfer of the tulsa  oklahoma fabrication operations to the houston  texas fabrication facility were million during the year ended march  these costs were primarily for severance  personnel costs and relocation costs 
the company does not expect to incur additional facility consolidation costs during the two year period ending september  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk variable rate debt we are exposed to some market risk due to variable interest rates under our financing and interest rate swap arrangements 
the interest rate under our revolving credit facility  which had million outstanding as of march   is based upon  at our option  either a base rate plus an applicable margin  which varies from to based on our leverage ratio  or one  two  three or six month libor  plus an applicable margin which varies from to based on our leverage ratio 
at june   the applicable rate was the one month libor  which was and the applicable margin was 
at march   million of the million term loan under our senior secured credit facility remained floating 
the remaining million is subject to interest rate swap agreements  which are described below in interest rate swap arrangements 
this facility provides  at our option  for interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin of either or depending on our rating from s p and moodys  or one  two  three or six month libor  plus a variable margin of either or depending on the rating from s p and moodys 
at june   the applicable rate was the one month libor  which was  and the applicable margin was 
also at march   million of our million abs facility was subject to a variable interest rate at one month libor  which was at june   plus 
the remaining million is subject to an interest rate swap agreement  which is described below in interest rate swap arrangements 
in addition  million of our million  senior notes  due in  are subject to interest rate swap agreements which convert the fixed rate to a variable rate 
the variable rate under these interest rate swap agreements is six month libor  in arrears  plus an average applicable margin of 
at june   the six month libor was 
as of march   approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness and other obligations bore interest at floating rates and a increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million annual increase in our interest expense 
interest rate swap arrangements we are also a party to interest rate swap agreements which are recorded at fair market value in our financial statements 
a change in the underlying interest rates may also result in a change in their recorded value 
at march   the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement related to our abs facility was million and the fair market value of this interest rate swap agreement was a liability of approximately million  which was recorded as a noncurrent liability 
the interest rate swap agreement terminates in february the fixed rate of this swap agreement is  for an all in fixed rate of on this portion of the abs facility  inclusive of the abs facility s applicable margin of 
at march   the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements related to the million term loan under our credit facility was million 
the fair market value of these interest rate swap agreements was an asset of approximately million  which was recorded as a noncurrent asset 
the interest rate swap agreements terminate in march the weighted average fixed rate of these interest rate swap agreements is  for an all in weighted average fixed rate of on this portion of the term loan  inclusive of the term loan s applicable margin of 
as noted above  the notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements related to our million senor notes was million 
the fair market value of these interest rate swap agreements at march   was approximately million 
since this arrangement is accounted for as a fair value hedge  the fair market value is recorded as an offset to the outstanding amount of the underlying debt 
these interest rate swap agreements terminate in may
