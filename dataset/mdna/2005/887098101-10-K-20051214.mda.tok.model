item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
special note regarding forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis and results of operations and other portions of this form k contain certain forward looking statements concerning future operations of the company 
management desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and is including this statement for the express purpose of availing the company of the protections of such safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
the company has used forward looking statements to describe future plans and strategies  including its expectations of the company s future financial results 
management s ability to predict results or the effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
factors which could affect actual results include interest rate trends  the general economic climate in the company s market area and the country as a whole  the ability of the company to control expenses  deposit flows  demand for mortgages and other loans  real estate values  vacancy rates  competition  loan delinquency rates  and changes in federal and state regulation 
these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements  and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
the company does not undertake to update any forward looking statement that may be made on behalf of the company 
critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified two policies  that as a result of judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights msrs 
these policies and the judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of management s discussion and analysis contained herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
in particular  note of the notes to consolidated financial statement  summary of significant accounting policies  describes generally the company s accounting policies 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of the company s consolidated financial statements to these critical policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the company s results of operations or financial condition 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for probable loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
the allowance is based upon management s comprehensive analysis of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions  and detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured 
the detailed analysis includes methods to estimate the fair value of loan collateral and the existence of potential alternative sources of repayment 
the appropriate allowance for loan loss level is estimated based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights are capitalized when acquired through the origination of loans that are subsequently sold with servicing rights retained and are amortized as an offset to servicing income on loans sold in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income 
the value of msrs at the date of the sale of loans is determined based on the discounted present value of expected future cash flows using key assumptions for servicing income and costs and prepayment rates on the underlying loans 
the estimated fair value is periodically evaluated for impairment by comparing actual cash flows and estimated cash flows from the servicing assets to those estimated at the time servicing assets were originated 
the effect of changes in market interest rates on estimated rates of loan prepayments represents the predominant risk characteristic underlying the msrs portfolio 
the company s methodology for estimating the fair value of msrs is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
for example  the determination of fair value uses anticipated prepayment speeds 
actual prepayment experience may differ and any difference may have a material effect on the fair value 
thus  any measurement of msrs fair value is limited by the conditions existing and assumptions as of the date made 
those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at different times

operating strategy the company is a holding company which operates primarily through its subsidiary  the bank 
the bank is a community oriented bank which has traditionally offered a wide variety of savings products to its retail customers while concentrating its lending activities on real estate loans 
the primary elements of the bank s operating strategy include emphasize residential mortgage lending and residential construction lending 
the bank has historically attempted to establish itself as a niche lender in its primary market areas by focusing a part of its lending activities on the origination of loans secured by one to four family residential dwellings  including an emphasis on loans for the construction of residential dwellings 
in an effort to meet the credit needs of borrowers in its primary area  the bank actively originates one to four family mortgage loans that do not qualify for sale in the secondary market under fhlmc guidelines 
the bank has also been an active participant in the secondary market  originating residential loans for sale to the fhlmc on a servicing retained basis 
the bank occasionally retains fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans in its portfolio for yield and asset liability management purposes 
diversify primary market area by expanding branch office network 
in an effort to lessen its dependence on the grays harbor county market whose economy has historically been tied to the timber and fishing industries  the bank has opened branch offices in pierce  king  thurston and kitsap counties 
pierce  king  thurston and kitsap counties contain the olympia  bremerton  and seattle tacoma metropolitan areas and their economies are more diversified with the presence of government  aerospace and computer technology industries 
in october  the bank continued its geographic diversification by acquiring two branches in lewis county as part of a seven branch acquisition 
for additional information see item  business branch purchase and market area 
limit exposure to interest rate risk 
in recent years  a majority of the loans that the bank has retained in its portfolio generally have periodic interest rate adjustment features or have been relatively short term in nature 
loans originated for portfolio retention primarily have included arm loans and short term construction loans 
longer term fixed rate mortgage loans have generally been originated for sale in the secondary market 
management believes that the interest rate sensitivity of these adjustable rate and short term loans more closely match the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s funding sources than do other longer duration assets with fixed interest rates 
emphasize the origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
the bank established a business banking division in for the purpose of increasing the bank s origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
originally  three lenders were hired to staff the division 
currently  a division manager and eight lenders are active in the origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
increase the consumer loan portfolio 
in the bank hired a consumer loan specialist to increase the origination of consumer loans 
the consumer loans generated since that time have been secured primarily by real estate 
the bank expects to continue expanding its portfolio of consumer loans 
pursue low cost core deposits and deposit related fee income 
the bank has placed an emphasis on attracting commercial and personal checking accounts 
these transactional accounts typically provide a lower cost of funding than certificates of deposit accounts and generate non interest fee income 
the bank implemented a checking account acquisition program in to increase these transactional accounts 
on october   the bank increased its transaction account base by acquiring seven branches and the related deposits 
for additional information  see item  business branch purchase 
market risk and asset and liability management general 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investment  deposit and borrowing activities 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the bank manages other risks  such as credit quality and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk that could potentially have the largest material effect on the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
the bank does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instruments nor does it engage in hedging activities or derivative instruments 
furthermore  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s principal financial objective is to achieve long term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating market interest rates 
the bank has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in market interest rates by attempting to manage the difference between asset and liability maturities and interest rates 
the principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s interest earning assets by retaining in its portfolio  short term loans and loans with interest rates subject to periodic adjustments 
the bank relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds 
management believes retail deposits  compared to brokered deposits  reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  the bank promotes transaction accounts and certificates of deposit with terms of up to six years 
the bank has adopted a strategy that is designed to substantially match the interest rate sensitivity of assets relative to its liabilities 
the primary elements of this strategy involve originating arm loans for its portfolio  maintaining residential construction loans as a portion of total net loans receivable because of their generally shorter terms and higher yields than other one to four family residential mortgage loans  matching asset and liability maturities  investing in short term securities  originating fixed rate loans for retention or sale in the secondary market  and retaining the related mortgage servicing rights 
sharp increases or decreases in interest rates may adversely affect the bank s earnings 
based on a rate shock analysis prepared by the fhlb seattle  an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would increase the bank s projected net interest income by approximately  primarily because a larger portion of the bank s interest rate sensitive assets than interest rate sensitive liabilities would reprice within a one year period 
similarly  an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates would negatively affect net interest income by approximately  as repricing would have the opposite effect 
see quantitative aspects of market risk below for additional information 
management has sought to sustain the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
pursuant to this strategy  the bank actively originates adjustable rate loans for retention in its loan portfolio 
fixed rate mortgage loans with maturities greater than seven years generally are originated for the immediate or future resale in the secondary mortgage market 
at september   adjustable rate mortgage loans and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities constituted million or  of the bank s total combined mortgage loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio 
although the bank has sought to originate arm loans  the ability to originate such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers preferences 
particularly in lower interest rate environments  borrowers often prefer fixed rate loans 
consumer loans and construction and land development loans typically have shorter terms and higher yields than permanent residential mortgage loans  and accordingly reduce the bank s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at september   the construction and land development  and consumer loan portfolios amounted to million and million  or and of total loans receivable including loans held for sale  respectively 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
management of the bank monitors the bank s interest rate sensitivity through the use of a model provided for the bank by the fhlb seattle 
the model estimates the changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income in response to a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the model first estimates the level of the bank s npv market value of assets  less market value of liabilities  plus or minus the market value of any off balance sheet items under the current rate environment 
in general  market values are estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows of each instrument by appropriate discount rates 
the model then recalculates the bank s npv under different interest rate scenarios 
the change in npv under the different interest rate scenarios provides a measure of the bank s exposure to interest rate risk 
the following table is provided by the fhlb seattle based on data at september  net interest income current market value projected interest rate estimated change change estimated change change scenario value from base from base value from base from base dollars in thousands base   computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan repayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
furthermore  the computations do not reflect any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  the bank would be expected to experience a decrease in npv and a decrease in net interest income 
in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  a increase in npv and a increase in net interest income would be expected 
based upon the modeling described above  the bank s asset and liability structure generally results in decreases in npv and decreases in net interest income in a declining interest rate scenario 
this structure also generally results in increases in net interest income in a rising interest rate environment 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could possibly deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
comparison of financial condition at september  and september  the company s total assets increased to million at september  from million at september  primarily attributable to a million increase in net loans receivable  a million increase in investment securities including fhlb stock  and a million increase in cash and due from financial institutions and federal funds sold 
this asset growth was primarily funded by the net cash received in connection with the acquisition of seven branch offices and related deposits in october the branch acquisition furthered the bank s geographic diversification efforts and increased the bank s deposit market share in existing markets 
a majority of the acquired deposit base consisted of checking  savings  and money market accounts which will provide a valuable core deposit base to fund loan growth

loans receivable and loans held for sale  net of allowance for loan losses net loans receivable  including loans held for sale  increased by million to million at september  from million at september  the increase in the portfolio was primarily a result of increases of million in commercial real estate loans  million in consumer loans  million in one to four family mortgage loans  million in land loans  million in construction loans net of undisbursed portion  and million in commercial business loans 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in multi family loans 
loan originations totaled million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september  the bank sold million in fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september  loan originations and loan sales were higher in primarily due to the robust refinance activity of single family mortgage loans attributed to the low interest rate environment

partially offsetting these decreases to equity  were net income of million and a million increase to additional paid in capital from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of shares associated with the bank s benefit plans 
also increasing shareholders equity were decreases of  and  in the equity components related to unearned shares issued to the management recognition and development plan mrdp and the esop  respectively  as more shares vested under the mrdp and were released under the esop 
comparison of operating results for the years ended september  and the company s net income increased by to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  diluted earnings per share increased by to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the improved results were primarily a result of increased net interest income and increased non interest income  which were partially offset by higher non interest expenses 
the increased net interest income was largely a result of an increased loan portfolio and an increased investment securities portfolio 
these portfolio increases were primarily funded by the net cash received in connection with the acquisition of seven branch offices and related deposits in october the acquired deposit base represents a valuable low cost funding source for the bank as a majority of the deposits consist of checking  savings  and money market accounts 
net interest income was increased as the bank was successful in deploying a substantial portion of the net cash received from the deposit acquisition into loans and investment securities 
the increase in non interest income was primarily a result of increased service charges from deposits and increased atm transaction fees 
these increases were largely a result of an increased transaction account base attributable to the branch acquisition 
non interest income was also increased during the year as a result of a  gain from the sale of the bank s credit card portfolio 
partially offsetting the increased net interest income and non interest income was and increase in non interest expenses as the bank operated with a larger branch network and employee base as a result of the branch acquisition 
the company also incurred approximately  in compliance costs attributable to section of the sarbanes oxley act of during the year ended september  a more detailed explanation of the income statement categories is presented below 
net income net income for the year ended september  increased million to million  or per diluted share per basic share from million  or per diluted share per basic share for the year ended september  the increase in diluted earnings per share for the year ended september  was primarily the result of a million million net of income tax per diluted share increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses  a million  net of income tax per diluted share increase in non interest income  and a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately 
these items were partially offset by a million million net of income tax per diluted share increase in non interest expense 
net interest income net interest income increased million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily as a result of increased interest income from a larger interest earning asset base 
total interest income increased million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as average total interest earning assets increased by million 
the increased interest earning asset balances were primarily a result of investing the funds received in connection with the october acquisition of deposits into loans and investment securities 
the increased interest earning balances were partially offset by a reduction in the yield on assets 
the yield on earning assets decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the decrease in yield was partially attributable to a change in the composition of interest earning assets as investment securities comprised a higher percentage of the total interest earning asset base during also partially offsetting the increased interest income was an increase in interest expense as average interest bearing deposits and borrowings increased 
total interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as average interest bearing liabilities increased million 
as a result of these changes the net interest margin decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the provision for loan losses was lower primarily as a result of changes in the composition of the portfolio  a decrease in the level of loans classified as substandard  and a decrease in the level of actual charge offs 
for the years ended september  and  net charge offs were  and  the net charge offs to average outstanding loans ratio was for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  the bank has established a comprehensive methodology for determining the provision for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis the bank performs an analysis taking into consideration pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience for various loan segments  changes in economic conditions  delinquency rates  a detailed analysis of individual loans on non accrual status  and other factors to determine the level of allowance for loan losses needed 
the allowance for loan losses increased by of  to million at september  from million at september  the increased level of the allowance for loan losses was primarily attributable to a larger loan portfolio loans receivable and loans held for sale  which increased by million to million at september  from million at september  partially offsetting the increased allowance due to loan portfolio growth  were decreases in the level of loans classified as substandard and changes in the category composition of the loan portfolio 
the bank s million credit card portfolio  which historically had the highest charge off rate  was sold in december based on the comprehensive methodology  management deemed the allowance for loan losses of million at september  of loans receivable and of non performing loans adequate to provide for probable losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at that date 
while the bank believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with gaap  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the bank s loan portfolio  will not request the bank to increase significantly its allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information  see item  business lending activities allowance for loan losses 
non interest income total non interest income increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily as a result of an  increase in service charges on deposits  a  increase in atm transaction fees  a  increase in income from loan sales gain on sale of loans and servicing income on loans sold and an  distribution from one of the bank s atm network associations 
the increased service charges on deposits and the increased atm transaction fees were primarily a result of the increased transaction account base acquired through the branch acquisition in october the increased income from loan sales was primarily attributable to  gain from the sale of the bank s credit card portfolio 
the increased income from the credit card portfolio is partially offset by a  decrease in income from the sale and servicing income on fixed rate one to four family mortgages 
the atm network association distribution was cash consideration paid to network association members in connection with the association s merger 
non interest expense total non interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   as the company operated with a larger branch network as a result of the acquisition of seven branch offices and the associated employees in october the increase was primarily a result of a million increase in salaries and employee benefits  a  core deposit intangible amortization expense  a  increase in premises and equipment expenses  a  increase in postage and courier expense  a  increase in atm operating fees and  in expenses associated with the branch acquisition in october the increased employee expenses were primarily attributable to the larger employee base resulting from the branch acquisition  annual salary adjustments  and increased medical insurance costs 
the company also incurred approximately  in compliance related costs attributable to section of the sarbanes oxley act of during the year ended september  the company s efficiency ratio decreased slightly to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  primarily as a result of increased income before taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily a result of a decrease in the percentage of tax exempt income during the current year and tax adjustments relating to the company s branch acquisition 
comparison of operating results for years ended september  and the company s net income decreased by to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  diluted earnings per share decreased by to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the lower earnings were primarily attributable to decreased income from loan sales and increased non interest expense  which were partially offset by increased net interest income 
specifically  the per diluted share decrease in earnings for the year ended september  was a result of the million million net of income tax per diluted share decrease in non interest expense  and the   net of income tax per diluted share increase in non interest expense 
these items were partially offset by a million  net of income tax per diluted share increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses and a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding due to share repurchases  which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately the million decrease in non interest income was largely attributable to decreased income from loan sales as mortgage banking activity slowed and the bank began holding some shorter term fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans in its portfolio 
income from loan sales gain on sale of loans and servicing income on loans sold decreased by million during the year as the bank s sale of fixed rate mortgage loans decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the  increase in non interest expense was primarily attributable to increased employee expenses  increased audit and consulting expenses  and increased premises and equipment expenses 
employee expenses increased by  primarily as a result of a larger employee base  annual salary adjustments  and increased medical insurance costs 
the million increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to decreased funding costs and a decreased provision for loan losses 
a more detailed explanation of the income statement categories is presented below 
net interest income net interest income increased  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a decrease in the company s funding costs 
total interest expense decreased by million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as the company s total cost of funds decreased to from 
interest expense on deposits decreased million to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  primarily due to lower average rates paid on interest bearing accounts and a change in the composition of average interest bearing deposits 
in  certificates of deposits  the company s highest cost of deposits  comprised of average interest bearing deposits 
in  certificates of deposit comprised of average interest bearing deposits 
the change in the composition of the deposit base was a result of the continued focus on attracting transaction accounts rather than higher rate certificates of deposit 
interest expense on fhlb advances decreased  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a reduction in the average outstanding fhlb advances to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  partially offsetting the decreased interest expense was a decrease in interest income 
total interest income decreased  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to a reduction in average yields on earning assets

the bank has established a comprehensive methodology for determining the provision for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis the bank performs an analysis taking into consideration historic loss experience for various loan segments  changes in economic conditions  delinquency rates  and other factors to determine the level of allowance for loan losses needed 
the allowance for loan losses had a net increase of  to million at september  from million at september  the increased level of the allowance for loan losses was primarily due to a larger loan portfolio loans receivable and loans held for sale  which increased million to million at september  from million at september  partially offsetting the increased allowance tied to loan portfolio growth  were changes in the loss factors used in the allowance for loan loss analysis for certain categories 
based on the trends in the historical charge off and improved economic conditions  the loss factors used in the allowance for loan loss analysis for one to four family loans  multi family loans  commercial real estate loans  land loans  and commercial business loans were decreased during the year 
based on the comprehensive methodology  management deemed the allowance for loan losses of million at september  of loans receivable and of non performing loans adequate to provide for probable losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at that date 
while the bank believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with gaap  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the bank s loan portfolio  will not request the bank to increase significantly its allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect the bank s financial condition and results of operations

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are customer deposits  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and the sale of loans  maturing securities and fhlb advances 
while the maturity and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals  to satisfy other financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities

the primary impact of inflation on the operation of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
