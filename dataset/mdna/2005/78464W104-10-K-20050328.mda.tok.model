item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis should be read with our financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains trend analysis and might contain forward looking statements 
these statements are based on current expectations and actual results might differ materially 
among the factors that could cause actual results to vary are those described in this overview section and in business risk factors that might affect future results 
we provide central processing and supply chain management services to hospitals and surgery centers throughout the united states of america 
we help health care providers balance their needs for quality  safety  environmental responsibility  efficiency and cost effectiveness by providing a unique combination of outsourced instrument supply and processing services  high quality reusable products including gowns  towels  drapes  and basins  disposable surgical products  and what we believe to be the industry s most comprehensive case cart management system 
we operate from ten food and drug administration regulated reusable processing facilities  strategically located throughout the united states of america  and one disposable products facility 
our integrated closed loop process starts with daily delivery of surgical supplies to the health care provider 
at the same time  we pick up used reusable products and surgical instruments for return to our processing facility 
after we return used products to our processing facility  we sort  clean  inspect  package  sterilize  and ship them back to the health care providers to stock as on hand inventory 
since his appointment as our ceo on december   christopher carlton and the board of directors have dedicated significant time confirming our future strategy and evaluating our resources 
our principal strategic opportunity to improve our operating results is to capitalize on our strong service capabilities and considerable infrastructure by leveraging our current relationships with existing customers and adding new 
table of contents customers 
we plan to continue to focus on introducing our current and potential new customers to our physician specific readycase sm case cart management system 
we believe that our readycase sm growth strategy  begun in recent years  is a strong strategy that has not benefited from proper execution and focus 
we have undertaken significant efforts to identify  recruit  and train new sales resources to help us fully execute these strategies 
we believe our facilities are strategically situated to capitalize on future market opportunities 
these facilities currently operate at less than of their aggregate annual revenue capacity and provide ample room for business growth without requiring significant incremental capital investment 
we continue to seek ways to better maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of our operating processes 
our revenue growth is primarily determined by our number of customers  the number and type of surgical procedures that we service for each customer  and pricing for our various types of surgical packs and procedures 
our revenue growth and efficiency in delivering products and services to customers primarily determine our profitability 
we incur most of our cost of revenues from processing the reusable surgical products instruments and linens at our processing facilities 
we also amortize the cost of our reusable surgical products that we own and supply to customers over their expected useful life 
our instrument supply arrangements use instruments owned by aesculap  which receives an agreed upon fee for each procedure based on the number and kinds of procedures performed with its instruments and the number and combination of instruments used for each procedure 
this arrangement allows us to limit our cost of capital for instrument programs 
the rfid technology we implemented will offer us improved inventory control and monitoring of product quality 
in  we continued to experience significant pricing and competitive pressures  principally from competitors offering disposable alternatives to our reusable products  which we expect will continue in however  we achieved overall revenue growth of from from the continued growth of our instrument processing programs and expansion of our business with existing customers 
even though we successfully managed to achieve revenue growth  we did not meet our expectations 
we believe that a greater focus on the implementation of our strategy should enable us to achieve better results in the future 
our net loss for of approximately million per basic and diluted share includes a non cash charge to operations in our fourth quarter of million after tax or per share from the impairment of our entire goodwill from previous acquisitions 
excluding this charge  we had non gaap net earnings for of  non gaap net earnings per basic and diluted share 
non gaap net earnings or loss excludes the impairment charge  does not measure financial performance under gaap  and is not a substitute for or superior to gaap net earnings 
we believe this measure presents our results on a more comparable operational basis by excluding the impairment charge as a significant and non recurring item 
we test our goodwill for impairment in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement goodwill and other intangible assets  as noted below under critical accounting policies and estimates 
in preparing our financial statements  we recorded a non cash impairment charge related to the carrying value of our goodwill for the year  based principally on an analysis by an independent valuation firm of our market value  historical and projected cash flows  and comparative market data 
the charge will not result in future cash expenditures or affect compliance with our financial covenants with lenders 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going 
table of contents basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions 
note b to our financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods that we use in preparing our financial statements 
we identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in preparing our financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts relates to accounts receivable not expected to be collected from our customers 
this allowance is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances  the overall aging of the balances  and the financial stability of the customer 
if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates or actual defaults run at a rate higher than historical experience  we would be required to increase this allowance  which could adversely affect our results of operation 
reserves for shrinkage  obsolescence  and scrap for reusable surgical products 
we determine our reserves for shrinkage and obsolescence of our reusable surgical products based on historical experience 
we treat any products not scanned by our radio frequency identification system rfid for a day period as lost 
also  as we gain more data from experience with rfid  we may determine that our reserves need to be adjusted  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we determine our reserve for scrap based upon quality assurance initiatives and historical evidence 
our reserve for instrument losses is based on our assessment of our historical loss experience for owned instruments 
the majority of the instruments are owned and provided by aesculap  which mitigates our risk 
if actual scrap and loss exceed our estimates  our reserves for shrinkage  obsolescence and scrap would increase  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
amortization of reusable products 
our reusable surgical products are stated at cost and amortization is computed on a basis similar to the units of production method 
we estimate the useful lives for each product based on our estimate of the total number of uses for which the product will be available 
we estimate that our products using the three principal fabrics accounting for of the reusable surgical products will be available for   and uses  based on several factors  including our actual experience with these products 
a reduction of five uses in the estimated life of these products would have increased our amortization expense for by approximately  to  we believe our rfid technology will enable us to evaluate these useful lives more often 
if our actual use experience with these products is shorter than these assumptions  our amortization rates for reusable products would increase  which could adversely affect our results of operation 
reserves for shrinkage and obsolescence for inventories 
we determine our reserves for shrinkage and obsolescence of our inventories based on historical results  including the results of cycle counts performed during the year and the evaluation of the aging of finished goods of reusable surgical products and disposable packs 
if actual losses exceed our estimates  our inventory reserves would increase  which could adversely affect our results of operation 
health insurance reserves 
we offer employee benefit programs  including health insurance  to eligible employees 
we retain a liability up to  annually for each health insurance claim 
health insurance costs are accrued using estimates to approximate the liability for reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
if actual claim results exceed our estimates  our health insurance reserve would increase  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise using the process prescribed in sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the testing for impairment of goodwill is performed in two steps potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit based on market capitalization  undiscounted cash flows  or other acceptable methods with its carrying amount  and if fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is estimated as the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over its fair value 
goodwill must be written down when impaired 

table of contents based on the and annual impairment tests  performed with the assistance of an independent third party valuation group  we determined that no impairment existed 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the annual fair value impairment assessment as of october  updated to december   utilizing a qualified independent valuation group 
based on this assessment  we concluded that the fair value of our goodwill was zero  resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million net of tax related to the carrying value of our goodwill for fair value of goodwill was estimated using a combination of market value  historical and projected cash flows  and comparative market data 
income taxes 
income taxes have been provided using the liability method in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date of the rate change 
the tax benefits must be reduced by a valuation allowance in certain circumstances 
realization of the deferred tax benefits is dependant on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of any net operating loss carry forwards nol s 
the deferred tax assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided for as necessary 
during  we recorded a valuation allowance of  attributable to our limited ability to utilize our state tax credit carry forward 
during  we increased this valuation allowance by  to  to reserve all new and remaining state tax credit carry forward we believe will not be realized 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement revised  share based payment statement r 
statement r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the cost will be measured based on the fair value of the instruments issued 
statement r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
statement r replaces statement  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
as originally issued in  statement established as preferable the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in opinion  as long as the footnotes to the financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
we will be required to apply statement r as of the first interim reporting period that begins after june   and we plan to use the modified prospective method  effective july  we are currently evaluating the impact statement r will have and  based on a preliminary analysis  expect to incur approximately  in additional compensation expense during the period of july  to december

the radio frequency identification rfid technology implemented in our reusable processing facilities enabled us to eliminate labor intensive bar code scanning and better identify product usage in these benefits were partially offset by the continued impact of pricing pressures and increased costs of health insurance claims and workers compensation insurance 
we were also negatively impacted by a need to reserve additional slow moving rsp products

depreciation expense for increased approximately  over the prior year due to the elimination in december of the off balance sheet financing for two of our processing facilities 
a reusable surgical products amortization credit of approximately  per quarter  annually  from an acquisition in prior years  was fully utilized as of december  during  we dedicated resources to complete an initiative to improve the appearance of our facilities and remove worn and poor quality gowns from our production process 

table of contents distribution expenses distribution expenses increased  or  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenues  distribution expenses increased  to in  from in the increase in distribution expenses as a percentage of revenues resulted primarily from higher insurance costs in and from higher vehicle lease expenses

our selling and administrative expense also increased due to the impact of a new sales compensation program  recruiting and relocation costs  insurance costs  and marketing and administrative fees for group purchasing organization 
we also incurred higher professional fees in due to one year consulting arrangements with two of our former officers  which expired on december  these increases were offset to some extent by lower severance payments in and reduced legal fees as a result of the settlement of sec and legal proceedings 
derivative instruments we recognized current unrealized gains of  in for our guarantee of two interest rate swaps of a third party in we accounted for these costs pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instrument and hedging activities until the swaps terminated in april we did not have derivative instruments in interest expense  net interest expense increased  or  to million in  from million in  primarily due to our elimination in december of an off balance sheet financing arrangement for two of our processing facilities 
we now finance these facilities through bonds rather than as operating leases

liquidity and capital resources recently  our principal source of capital has been cash flows from operations 
we also have available borrowings under our revolving credit facility to satisfy working capital and capital expenditure needs  if necessary 

table of contents we generated million of cash from operating activities during  compared to million in our cash flow from operations decreased during compared to  principally due to increases in disposable inventory and accounts receivable  partially offset by decreased prepaid expenses and increased accounts payable 
in  we increased our sales of disposable products to one of our largest customers  which required us to maintain higher levels of disposable inventory 
we also increased our purchases of reusable surgical products from standard textile due to favorable tax depreciation provisions in both of these factors attributed to the overall increase in accounts payable 
our net cash used in investing activities increased million for the year ended december  to million from million in the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to increased purchases of reusable surgical products in as compared to we spent million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  to purchase property  plant and equipment 
we spent million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  to purchase reusable surgical products 
we estimate that our expenditures for property  plant and equipment approximately to million and reusable surgical products approximately to million will be approximately to million for the next twelve months 
this amount will fluctuate depending on the growth of our business 
we also plan to make additional expenditures related to our further implementation of our rfid technology to better enable us to track our product usage 
net cash used in financing activities decreased million for the year ended december  to million from million 
during  we repaid million of our revolving credit facility to reduce the outstanding balance from million to million 
during  we repaid million of our revolving credit facility to reduce the outstanding balance from million to million 
in  we also repaid  of our bonds payable to reduce the outstanding balance from million to million 
we have a million revolving credit facility with wachovia bank and southtrust bank 
wachovia completed an acquisition of southtrust in october our outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility were approximately million and million on december   and december   respectively 
as of december   we had cash of  as well as an additional million available under our revolving credit facility 
the amount available under our revolving credit facility is limited by a financial covenant requiring that we maintain at least a to consolidated leverage ratio earnings coverage of debt at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a scheduled maturity date of june  the facility s interest rate as of december  varies between and basis points over libor depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
the credit facility requires us to maintain a tangible net worth of not less than million plus of cumulative net income for each fiscal quarter beginning with the fiscal quarter ended june   b a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than to measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended  and c a funds flow coverage ratio of not less than to measured at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the credit facility restricts us from paying dividends  incurring additional indebtedness  encumbering assets  and entering into merger  consolidation or liquidation transactions representing greater than of consolidated assets 
we complied with all requirements of the credit facility as of december  in december  we exercised an option to purchase our corporate headquarters building  which is a  square foot building located in tampa  florida 
the actual purchase price will be the greater of original cost approximately  or the building s value as determined by an appraisal using a process that the lease describes 
we have initiated a judicial proceeding with the owner and landlord requesting that the court determine several legal issues regarding the appraisal 
see item and note n to the financial statements 
we expect to complete the purchase of the building within the next months  after final determination of the appraised value 
we are currently negotiating to obtain mortgage financing to fund the purchase  supplemented by our existing credit facility  if necessary 

table of contents the building is currently recorded as a capital lease in our financial statements 
in accordance with fasb interpretation  accounting for purchase of a leased asset by the lessee during the term of the lease  the difference  if any  between the purchase price and the carrying amount of the lease obligation will be recorded as an adjustment of the carrying amount of the asset on our balance sheet 
when we complete the purchase transaction  the building will be depreciated over its remaining useful life 
in  we issued public bonds to fund the construction of two of our reusable processing facilities 
interest expense adjusts based on rates that approximate libor at december  
starting in  we began amortizing the bonds through quarterly payments of  balloon principal payments of million are due on the bonds in the bonds payable are secured by the two reusable processing facilities 
letters of credit issued by wachovia bank back these bonds 
we paid a commitment fee of approximately  basis points for the letters of credit in february the letters of credit must be renewed each year through maturity in we believe that our cash flows from operating activities and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our growth and anticipated capital requirements for the next twelve months 
as of december  and  we have no off balance sheet financing 
our contractual cash obligations for future minimum payments  including interest  under our capital lease  operating leases  bonds payable  and notes payable to bank as of december   are as follows contractual obligations payments due by period s total less than year years years after years notes payable to bank  bonds payable and obligation under capital lease operating leases total contractual cash obligations the table reflects that our revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature on june  we would expect to renew the facility under similar terms when it matures

see legal proceedings 
these operating leases are subject to renewals that we may exercise  however  the amounts related to these renewals are not included in the table 
see properties 
we offer instruments pursuant to our joint marketing agreement with aesculap  inc under the terms of this agreement  aesculap furnishes and repairs all of the surgical instruments that we deliver to customers and receives an agreed upon fee for each procedure 
we also have a procurement agreement with standard textile under which we agree to purchase of our reusable surgical products from them 
we are not bound to purchase any minimum quantity of products under these agreements  however  we expect to make payments under the contracts to fulfill our requirements 
we estimate that our payments under these agreements will be between and million in amounts paid under these agreements will vary based upon changes in customer demand  amortization rates  product prices  and other variables affecting our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the outstanding balances under our revolving credit facility were approximately million and million on december  and december   respectively 
the credit facility s interest rate as of december  varies between and basis points over libor  depending on our leverage ratio 
table of contents earnings coverage of debt 
we are subject to changes in our interest expense on this facility based on fluctuations in interest rates 
assuming an outstanding balance of this facility of million  if libor were to increase decrease by basis points  our interest payments would increase decrease by  per quarter 
interest on our bonds that financed two of our facilities is at a rate that approximates libor 
we are subject to changes in our interest expense on these bonds based on fluctuations in interest rates 
assuming an outstanding balance of these bonds of million  if libor were to increase decrease by basis points  our interest payments would increase decrease by  per quarter 
we do not have any other material market risk sensitive instruments
