item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of psb should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of psb  including the related notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
general psb s results of operations depend primarily on the bank s net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  and interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities 
its interest earning assets consist primarily of loans receivable  investment securities  and interest earning deposits while its interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits 
the bank s net income is also affected by its provision for loan losses and its level of non interest income as well as by its non interest expense  such as salary and employee benefits  occupancy costs  and charges relating to non performing and other classified assets 
impact of inflation the financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operation of the bank is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company and its subsidiaries conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap applicable to the financial services industry 
all significant inter company transactions are eliminated in consolidation and certain reclassifications are made when necessary to conform the previous year s financial statements to the current year s presentation 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and revenues and expenditures for the periods presented 
therefore  actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
allowance for credit losses psb uses the reserve method of accounting for credit losses 
the balance in the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s review and evaluation of the loan portfolio in relation to past loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic events and conditions  and other pertinent factors  including management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses 
increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses 
credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
while management considers the allowance for loan and lease losses to be adequate based on information currently available  future additions to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions or management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses and management s intent with regard to the disposition of loans and leases 
in addition  the regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review psb s allowance for loan losses 
the regulators may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
income taxes under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
based upon the review of all components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  future taxable income of psb and regulatory guidelines  management has determined that no allowance is deemed necessary at december  however  circumstances could arise that would require management to revisit the need for such an allowance 
performance overview psb s net income for was million or on a diluted per share basis  compared to million or on a diluted per share basis for  and million or per diluted share for after the cumulative effect of an accounting change net income of million or per diluted share prior to the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 on january   after the revaluation of certain deferred assets relating to the acquisition of jade  psb recognized a cumulative effect of an accounting change of million which represented the remaining unamortized portion of negative goodwill related to the jade acquisition 
net interest income and average balances comparison of results of operations in and net interest income is the key component of the bank s profitability and is managed in coordination with the bank s interest rate sensitivity position 
net interest income in of million was  or higher than net interest income in of million 
the bank s net interest margin  net interest income divided by total average interest earning assets  decreased six basis points to in from in the bank s net interest spread  the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  decreased five basis points for to from in during the twelve month period of  the bank experienced an overall decrease on the yield of its interest earning assets of basis points 
in  the rate paid by the bank on its interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points from in to 
this is generally reflective of movements in market rates 
toward the end of  the federal reserve began to increase short term rates but to date long term rates have not increased proportionately 
this may cause further margin compression over time 
average investments including mortgage backed securities and interest earning deposits with banks decreased million or at december   to million compared to million at december  the decrease in in interest earning deposits with banks is largely due to an increase in loan demand 
at december   the bank s average loans were million representing of total interest earning assets and provided a yield of compared to average loans of million for which represented of interest earning assets and provided a yield of 
the bank experienced improved commercial  consumer and mortgage loan demand in  leading to higher originations 
at december   total average interest bearing liabilities increased million or to million compared to million at december  total interest expense decreased million at december   to million as compared to total interest expense of million at december  the increase in the bank s total average interest bearing liabilities was caused by a decision by the bank to increase deposits to enable the bank to meet increased loan demand 
the bank s cost of funds over the last two years was in and in average balance sheets and rate yield analysis net interest income is affected by changes in both average interest rates and average volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table presents  on a tax equivalent basis  the average daily balances of assets  liabilities and shareholders equity and the respective interest earned or incurred on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as average rates for the period indicated year ended december  average balance interest yield rate average balance interest yield rate average balance interest yield rate dollars in thousands assets interest earning assets interest earning deposits   investment securities     mortgage backed securities     net loans     total interest earning assets    noninterest earning assets   total assets    liabilities interest bearing liabilities now checking accounts   money market accounts    savings deposits     certificates     total deposits     borrowed money    total interest bearing liabilities    noninterest bearing liabilities   total liabilities    retained earnings and shareholders equity   total liabilities and retained earnings and shareholders equity  net interest income   interest rate spread net yield on interest earning assets ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities x x x includes loans held for sale the interest earned on nontaxable investment securities and loans is shown on a tax equivalent basis 
nonaccrual loans have been included in the appropriate average loan balance category  but interest on nonaccrual loans has not been included for purposes of determining interest income 
the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the bank s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of changes in volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate in thousands versus versus increase decrease increase decrease volume rate net change volume rate net change interest income interest bearing deposits with banks investment securities mortgage backed securities  loans     total interest income     interest expense now checking accounts money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit  borrowings total interest expense    net change in net interest income    provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents the charge against earnings that is required to fund the allowance for loan losses 
the bank determines the level of the allowance for loan losses through a regular review of the loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an examination of the portfolio as well as such factors as declining trends  the volume of loan concentrations  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to pay  prior loss experience within the portfolio  current economic conditions and the results of the most recent regulatory examinations 
the bank allocated   and million as additions to the allowance for loan loss and had charge offs against the allowance of   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
for  management determined that  based on relatively stable economic conditions and a review of the specific factors affecting the allowance  the addition to the provision was deemed adequate 
the methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss considers both risk and economic factors 
the analysis includes all types of loans  with the applied methodology commensurate to the risk assessment for the portfolio and present economic conditions 
the risk rating of the loan portfolio is updated quarterly by management and utilized for an overall assessment of the loan loss reserve adequacy  the results of which are reported quarterly to the board 
the results of the assessment of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve  utilizing the risk ratings and economic factors  receive the close attention of management on an ongoing basis  with appropriate revisions made to the methodology in accordance with regulatory standards  changes in lending policies  economic business conditions  past due classified loans  quality of loan review  concentration of credit  and examination input 
it is important to note that an effective internal loan review function is an essential element in satisfactorily implementing the bank s methodology 
although management utilizes its best judgment in providing for loan losses  there can be no assurance that the bank will not have to increase its provision for loan losses in the future as a result of possible future increases to its non performing loans or for other reasons based on changes in facts and circumstances 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses and the carrying value of its non performing assets 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to its allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination

 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under sfas no  the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the principal types of accounts resulting in differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are the allowance for loan losses  leased assets  deferred loan fees and compensation 
psb had an income tax provision of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
psb had an effective tax rate of  and for the years ended december   and liquidity and interest rate sensitivity integral to the management of psb s balance sheet is the maintenance of adequate liquidity and the ability to evaluate and control interest rate risk 
liquidity represents the ability to meet potential cash outflows resulting from deposit customers who need to withdraw funds or borrowers who need available credit 
interest rate sensitivity focuses on the impact of fluctuating interest rates and the repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities on net interest income 
psb s asset liability management committee monitors the level of short term assets and liabilities to maintain an appropriate balance between liquidity  risk  and return 
liquidity is derived from various sources that include increases in core deposits  sales of certificates of deposits  loan principal repayments  loan maturities  and cash received on maturities or amortization of investment securities 
at december   psb had million of cash and cash equivalents 
the liquidity position of psb is also strengthened by the availability of a million credit facility with the fhlb 
advances are secured by fhlb stock and qualifying mortgage loans 
there were no advances outstanding against this line at december   or at december  management anticipates utilizing its excess liquidity to increase its commercial lending portfolio during maximizing cash flow over time is crucial to the maintenance of adequate liquidity 
psb s total cash flow is a product of its operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
during the twelve month period ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million  compared to net cash used by operating activities of million for the same period of during  net cash used in investing activities was million  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of  for the same period of financing activities provided cash of million during the twelve months ended december   compared to million in net cash used in financing activities for the same period of the net result of these items was a million increase in cash and cash equivalents for the twelve month period ended december   compared to a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the same period of the significant change in cash and cash equivalents from year to year reflects psb s emphasis on deposit generation 
interest rate risk management is closely related to liquidity management because each is directly affected by the maturity of assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk management monitors the effect that fluctuations in interest rates have on net interest income 
the primary function of psb s interest rate sensitivity management is to reduce exposure to interest rate risk through an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the goal is to minimize fluctuations in the net interest margin of the bank due to general changes in interest rates 
the net interest margin of a bank that does not have a relatively close relationship between the quantity of assets that mature or re price within a given time period and the quantity of liabilities that mature or re price within the same time period will fluctuate more widely than a bank that has a closer match 
furthermore  a bank that has liabilities that reprice earlier than its assets will have a decline in its net interest margin as interest rates rise 
the blending of fixed and floating rate loans and investments to match their pricing and maturity characteristics against those of the various funding sources is a continuous process in an attempt to minimize fluctuations in net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
the composition of the balance sheet is designed to minimize any significant fluctuation in net interest income and to maximize liquidity 
one tool used by management to gauge the structure of the balance sheet is a gap analysis that categorizes assets and liabilities on the basis of maturity date  the date of next re pricing  and the applicable amortization schedule 
this analysis summarizes the matching or mismatching of rate sensitive assets versus rate sensitive liabilities according to specified time periods 
management concentrates on the zero to three month and one year gap intervals 
at december   psb had a one five year positive cumulative gap of million and a gap ratio of or of total assets as of that date

the effect that changing interest rates have on psb s net interest income is simulated by increasing and decreasing interest rates 
this simulation is known as rate shocking 
the report below forecasts changes in psb s market value of equity under alternative interest rate environments 
the market value of equity is defined as the net present value of psb s existing assets and liabilities 
market value of equity change in market value of equity percentage change basis points   basis points   basis points   flat rate  basis points   basis points   basis points   a plus or minus basis point rate shock test for the change in the market value of equity indicates at most limited economic value sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
a rate shock test indicates the market value of equity increases as rates rise and decreases as rates decline 
the bank s largest exposure is a negative reduction in the change in the market value of equity in a plus basis point scenario and a gain of in a minus basis point scenario 
in the event psb should experience a mismatch in its desired gap ranges or an excessive decline in its market value of equity resulting from changes in interest rates  it has a number of options that it could utilize to remedy such a mismatch 
psb could restructure its investment portfolio through the sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes 
it could also emphasize growth in loan products with appropriate maturities or repricing attributes  or seek to attract deposits or obtain borrowings with desired maturities 
there are no known trends or any known demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result in  or that are reasonably likely to result in liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way in the commitment expiration periods for commitments of psb as of december  are as follows in thousands commitment period total amount committed one year or less yrs

net interest income in of million was  or higher than net interest income of million 
in total interest income decreased million or to million from million in the bank had a decrease in total interest expense in of million 
the bank s net interest margin  net interest income divided by total average interest earning assets  increased one basis point to in the modest increase in is primarily related to the decision to allow some of the bank s higher rate deposits to run off  therefore decreasing the bank s overall cost of funds and improving the net interest margin 
the bank s net interest spread  the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  increased three basis points for to from in during the twelve month period of  the bank experienced an overall decrease on the yield of its interest earning assets of basis points 
in  the rate paid by the bank on its interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points from in to 
because of the bank s excellent liquidity position  it was able to decrease the rate paid on deposits and allow some run off without affecting its ability to meet loan demand 
the result was a modest increase in the interest rate spread and net interest margin and increased interest income 
at december   the bank s average loans were million representing of total interest earning assets and provided a yield of compared to average loans of million for which represented of total assets and provided a yield of 
the three basis point increase in the yield on the loan portfolio in is almost exclusively due to a million facility fee on a construction loan that was received in average investments including mortgage backed securities and interest earning deposits with banks increased million or at december  to million compared to million at december  the increase in in average investments and interest earning deposits with banks is largely due to a decrease in loan demand 
due to the declining interest rate environment  the bank experienced a high volume of consumer and mortgage loan amortization that the bank was unable to replace because of weak loan demand 
however  this run off of loans and lack of new loan demand did provide psb the opportunity to increase its investments without endangering its liquidity position 
at december   total average interest bearing liabilities decreased million or to million compared to million at december  total interest expense decreased million at december  to million as compared to total interest expense of million at december  the decrease in the bank s total average interest bearing liabilities was caused by a decision by the bank to allow some deposit run off 
when coupled with an overall decrease in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities this decision resulted in a lower aggregate cost of funds 
the bank s cost of funds over the last two years was in and in capital adequacy the bank is required to maintain minimum ratios of tier i and total capital to total risk weighted assets and a minimum tier i leverage ratio  as defined by the banking regulators

at december   psb s net loan portfolio  inclusive of loans held for sale  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase of million or is primarily the result of an increase in production of commercial  consumer and mortgage loans as a result of the growth in loan demand during investment activities the bank s investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
the carrying value of the bank s investment securities and mortgaged backed securities portfolio totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the bank s cash and cash equivalents  consisting of cash and due from banks  and interest earning deposits with other financial institutions  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the majority of the bank s mortgage backed securities are issued or guaranteed by the united states government or agencies thereof 
at december   mortgage backed securities totaled million compared to million at december  the majority of this amount represents securities that were issued or guaranteed by fnma  fhlmc or the government national mortgage association gnma 
the bank historically maintains high levels of interest earning deposits as part of its strategy for meeting liquidity requirements and improving interest rate sensitivity 
the bank is required under federal regulations to maintain a minimum amount of liquid assets that may be invested in specified short term securities and certain other investments 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and interest rate sensitivity 
the bank generally has maintained a portfolio of liquid assets that exceeds regulatory requirements 
liquidity levels may be increased or decreased depending upon the yields on investment alternatives and upon management s judgment as to the attractiveness of the yields available in relation to other opportunities and its expectation of the yield that will be available in the future  as well as management s projections as to the short term demand for funds to be used in the bank s loan origination and other activities 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the bank classifies its investment and mortgage backed securities as held to maturity  available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at market value  while held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost 
at december   million of the bank s investment securities and mortgaged backed securities were classified held to maturity and million of the bank s investment securities and mortgaged backed securities were classified available for sale 
the bank s board of directors has adopted an investment policy that identifies acceptable types of investments for the bank and establishes criteria to guide management in classifying investments as prescribed by sfas no 
the policy also authorizes the bank s investment officer to make investments of up to million 
under the investment policy  the bank may invest in certain aaa rated derivative securities 
as of december   the bank had no collateralized mortgage obligations 
the bank may not invest in high risk collateralized mortgage obligations cmo and the bank s investment officer must periodically analyze the risk of any cmo held by the bank to determine that such securities are not within the high risk category

growth in the commercial real estate portfolio is expected to continue at a steady rate 
interest rate changes could have a moderating effect on activity in this sector in spite of other favorable macro economic factors 
just as with the residential mortgage portfolio  commercial real estate is very interest rate sensitive 
to achieve growth in this portfolio  pricing must be carefully formulated to both attract borrowers and create a reasonable return for the bank 
construction lending continues to provide opportunities 
due to the higher levels of inherent risk in construction lending  these credits are thoroughly evaluated 
opportunities are more evident in this portfolio 
a defensive stance on long term fixed rate pricing is necessary to protect against margin compression 
volume for home equity loans continues to fluctuate 
in the current changing rate environment  management will continue to monitor growth in this portion of the consumer loan portfolio 
to help offset any payoff trend of current loans  management will be setting goals for new loan originations with branch managers  management will also become more aggressive in cross selling the consumer loan products  such as home equity loans  to the other subsidiaries of first penn bank such as tnmc 
finally  management will continue to develop loan referral business with outside mortgage brokers

contacts are generally made on the th day after a payment is due 
in most cases  deficiencies are cured promptly 
if a delinquency extends beyond days  the loan and payment history is carefully reviewed  additional notices are sent to the borrower and efforts are made to collect the loan 
while the bank generally prefers to work with borrowers to resolve such problems  when the account becomes days delinquent  the bank institutes foreclosure or other proceedings  as necessary  to minimize any potential loss 
non performing assets in  the bank s level of non performing assets decreased million or to million compared to an increase of  to million at december  from million at december  non accrual interest for and was and  respectively 
as a matter of policy  the accrual of loan interest is discontinued if management believes that  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest becomes doubtful 
this is normally done when a loan reaches days delinquent 
at this time  all accrued but unpaid interest is reversed out of interest income 
there are occasional exceptions if the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
the bank did not have any material restructured loans within the meaning of sfas no

the reo is initially recorded at the lower of the related loan balance or fair value of the property at the date acquired 
if the value of the property is less than the loan  less any related specific loan loss provision  the difference is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
any subsequent write down of reo is charged against earnings 
the bank had  and  of property acquired as a result of foreclosure at december  and classified assets as part of the bank s loan review procedures which ultimately result in the establishment of the bank s allowance for loan losses  the bank identifies and classifies its problem assets into three classifications substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the bank is not warranted 
the bank charges off that portion of an asset as soon as it is classified as a loss 
exclusive of the bank s  of reo  the bank s classified assets at december   consisted of million of loans classified as substandard  compared to million classified as substandard at december  loans classified as doubtful were for and loans classified as loss were  in compared to  in allowance for loan losses psb has an established process to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses  which assesses the risks and losses inherent in its portfolio 
this process provides an allowance consisting of an allocated and an unallocated component 
to determine the allocated component of the allowance  psb combines estimates of the reserves needed for loans evaluated on an individual basis with estimates of reserves needed for general pools of loans with similar risk characteristics
