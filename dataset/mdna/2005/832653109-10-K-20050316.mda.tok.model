item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risk  assumptions  and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
words such as believe  may  could  expects  likely  variations of these words  and similar expressions  are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below in the section entitled factors that may affect future results  as well as those discussed in this item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
business overview we are a truckload carrier that provides nationwide transportation of diversified freight  concentrating primarily on the flatbed segment of the truckload market 
we offer comprehensive truckload transportation services to shippers located predominantly between the rocky mountains in the west and the appalachian mountains in the east  and in the southern provinces of canada 
beginning in and continuing through most of  truckload carriers operated in a very difficult business environment 
a combination of high fuel prices  rising insurance premiums  tightened credit standards  a depressed used truck market  a declining number of independent contractors  and slowing freight demand associated with an economic downturn affected the profitability of many trucking companies  including smithway 
in addition to these general industry factors  the impact of the economic downturn on our customer base was particularly severe  resulting in a more pronounced weakening in our freight demand than that experienced by truckload carriers generally 
during that period  several customers experienced economic difficulties  some of which declared bankruptcy 
beginning in the last half of and continuing today  our industry has begun to feel the positive effects of an increase in freight demand and general economic improvement 
between the years and  our revenues decreased  to million in from million in  and  although our net loss of million for the year ending december was an improvement over our net losses of million and million for the years and  respectively  we had not operated profitably since in the second quarter of  we began to implement a plan designed to return smithway to profitability by achieving a more streamlined and efficient operation 
the main goals of the first phase of the plan were to reduce fixed costs  eliminate less productive assets  and increase the productivity of remaining assets 
as part of this plan  we have  among other things o consolidated operations by closing terminals  including two with maintenance facilities  o improved our ratio of tractors to non driving personnel by reducing our headcount  o reduced the size of our tractor and trailer fleets to better match the revenue base  and o focused our equipment on the most profitable customers  lanes  and loads 
the second phase of the plan  which we implemented in  focuses on revenue enhancements  replacing our highest mileage tractors  and continuing our cost control efforts 
the major components of this phase have included the following o we engaged in a broad based effort to raise our revenue per loaded mile  both generally and in respect of the new federally mandated hours of service requirements that affect our productivity if we are not adequately compensated for lost driving time 
o we increased the size of our fleet by  through recruiting additional independent contractors and pursuing opportunities to take over dedicated fleets currently operated by shippers for their own account 
o we replaced of our highest mileage tractors  and we believe the savings in maintenance costs as well as better driver retention resulting from this action will more than offset increased capital costs 
we plan to replace a similar number of tractors in o we have continued our cost control efforts 
our return to profitability in is a testament to the positive impact of both phases of the plan described above 
during  operating revenue increased by  compared with  despite a reduction in weighted average tractors 
average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenues  our main measure of asset productivity  improved  to  in from  in  as we increased miles per tractor  reduced non revenue miles  and reduced the number of tractors without drivers 
in addition  we reduced our fixed costs of terminals  equipment  and non driving personnel  although these savings were partially offset by higher maintenance and fuel costs per mile 
the net result was an improvement of basis points in our operating ratio  to in from in based on the success of the profit improvement plan  we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under our financing arrangement at december   and have successfully negotiated for a reduction in interest rate and other modifications to our financing arrangements 
based upon our improving results  anticipated future cash flows  current availability under our financing arrangement with lasalle bank  and other sources of equipment financing  we do not expect to experience liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
revenues and expenses we generate substantially all of our revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile for our services 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  and other accessorial services 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the united states economy  inventory levels  the level of capacity in the trucking industry  specific customer demand  and driver availability 
we monitor our revenue production primarily through average revenue per tractor per week 
in  our average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenues increased to  from  in we are encouraged by this improvement and by the fact that our operating revenue increased million  to million in from million in  while weighted average tractors decreased to  in from  in this reflects reductions during which were part of our planned disposition of unseated company owned tractors 
our ending fleet size grew by units to  units at december  compared to  units at december  the main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which are recorded under purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs are the acquisition and financing of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and the compensation of non driver personnel 
effectively controlling our expenses has been a key component of our profit improvement plan 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to revenue for the periods indicated operating revenue operating expenses purchased transportation compensation and employee benefits fuel  supplies  and maintenance insurance and claims taxes and licenses general and administrative communication and utilities depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment total operating expenses earnings loss from operations interest expense  net other income loss earnings before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss earnings comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue increased million to million in from million in the increase in operating revenue resulted from increased average operating revenue per tractor per week and an increase in fuel surcharge revenue  offset partially by a reduction in our weighted average tractors 
operating revenue  excluding fuel surcharge revenue  increased million to million in from million in average operating revenue per tractor per week increased significantly to  in from  in operating revenue includes revenue from operating our trucks as well as other  more volatile  revenue items  including fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue 
we believe the analysis of tractor productivity is more meaningful if fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue are excluded from the computation 
average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue increased to  in from  in  primarily due to increased production from our seated equipment and a lower number of unseated company tractors 
for the year  revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue increased to in from in fuel surcharge revenue increased million to million in from million in during and  approximately million and million  respectively  of the fuel surcharge revenue collected helped to offset our fuel costs 
the remainder was passed through to independent contractors 
our weighted average tractors decreased to  in from  in this reflects our planned reduction in fleet size implemented during which reduced the number of unmanned company owned tractors 
in addition  we contracted with a declining number of independent contractor providers of equipment throughout purchased transportation consists primarily of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment  expenses related to brokerage activities  and payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
purchased transportation increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  purchased transportation decreased to in from in the changes reflect a decrease in the number of independent contractors throughout and in the percentage of the fleet supplied by independent contractors 
the percentage of total operating revenue provided by independent contractors decreased to in from in we believe the decline in independent contractors as a percentage of our total fleet is attributable to high fuel costs  high insurance costs  tighter credit standards  and slow freight demand  which have diminished the pool of drivers interested in becoming or remaining independent contractors 
the decline in the number of independent contractors slowed significantly near the end of as freight demand and the general economy improved  and during  our number of independent contractors slowly increased 
compensation and employee benefits increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  compensation and employee benefits decreased to in from in  reflecting an increase in our revenue per loaded mile and fuel surcharge revenue which increases revenue without a proportionate increase in wages 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in the percentage of the fleet comprised of company owned tractors and an increase in drivers pay rate  which was raised approximately two cents per mile on august  the pay rate increase has improved our ability to compete for new drivers  and to retain current drivers  reducing our number of unfilled units 
however  if we experience a shortage of drivers in the near future  the increase in driver pay would negatively impact our results of operations to the extent that corresponding freight rate increases are not obtained 
finally  increases in health care costs continue to negatively impact our health insurance and workers compensation expense 
fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased to of revenue in compared with in this reflects higher fuel prices and an increase in the percentage of the fleet comprised of company owned tractors  partially offset by an increase in our rate per loaded mile which increases revenue without a corresponding increase in maintenance costs 
fuel prices increased approximately to an average of per gallon in from per gallon in the per gallon increase in fuel prices was partially offset by a per gallon million increase in fuel surcharge revenue attributable to company owned tractors which is included in operating revenue  mitigating of the increase in fuel prices 
insurance and claims increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance and claims increased to of revenue in compared with in during  we exercised an option to retroactively increase the deductible for our auto liability policy to  per incident beginning july  through june  which reduced our expense by  this did not recur in generally  higher insurance premiums and claims were partially offset by the elimination of premiums for excess insurance coverage which we discontinued in july  due to our financial condition and the rising cost of insurance  leaving million of primary coverage with a  self insured retention 
our past lack of excess coverage and our high self insured retention have increased our risk associated with frequency and severity of accidents and has had the potential to increase our expenses or make them more volatile from period to period 
furthermore  claims that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  or for which coverage is not provided  may cause our financial condition and results of operations to suffer a materially adverse effect 
for these reasons  in february  we reinstated million of excess insurance coverage for losses above our primary policy limit of million 
the cost of this excess insurance will increase our insurance premiums in the future but provides protection against unusually large claims 
taxes and licenses increased  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  taxes and licenses decreased to of revenue in compared with of revenue in  reflecting an increase in our revenue per loaded mile and fuel surcharge revenue which increases revenue without a proportionate increase in taxes and licenses 
general and administrative expenses remained constant at million in and as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenue in compared with in  reflecting an increase in our revenue per loaded mile and fuel surcharge revenue which increases revenue without a proportionate increase in general and administrative expenses 
communications and utilities decreased  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities decreased to of revenue in compared with of revenue in  reflecting an increase in our revenue per loaded mile and fuel surcharge revenue which increases revenue without a proportionate increase in communications and utilities expenses 
depreciation and amortization decreased million to million in from million in in accordance with industry practices  the gain or loss on retirement  sale  or write down of equipment is included in depreciation and amortization 
in and  depreciation and amortization included net gains from the sale of equipment of  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to of revenue in compared with in  partly due to increased average revenue per tractor and reduction of unseated tractors  which more efficiently spreads depreciation expense 
additionally  some of our older equipment still generates revenue but is no longer being depreciated 
in the short term  we expect that the presence of older equipment which is not being depreciated will more than offset increases in depreciation resulting from the addition of new equipment to our fleet 
over the long term  as we continue to upgrade our equipment fleet  we expect depreciation or equipment rent expense  a component of purchased transportation expense  to increase 
interest expense  net  decreased  to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to lower average debt outstanding  partially offset by higher interest rates 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense  net  decreased to of revenue in compared with in during  we recorded  of income from life insurance resulting from the death of william g 
smith  our former president and chief executive officer 
this non operating income is tax exempt and added to our earnings per share for this is a one time event which will not recur in the future 
as a result of the foregoing  our pre tax margin increased to in from in our income tax expense in was million  or of earnings before life insurance proceeds and income taxes 
our income tax benefit in was million  or of loss before income taxes 
in both years  the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate for a company headquartered in iowa because of the cost of nondeductible driver per diem expense absorbed by us 
the impact of paying per diem travel expenses varies depending upon the ratio of drivers to independent contractors and the level of our pre tax earnings or loss 
as a result of the factors described above  net earnings were million in of revenue  compared with a net loss of million in of revenue 
without the life insurance proceeds  our net earnings would have been million of revenue in the period 
in addition  our operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was during as compared with during comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue decreased million to million in from million in the decrease in operating revenue resulted from our planned reduction in fleet size to reduce the number of unmanned company owned tractors as well as from our yield management efforts  in which we ceased hauling certain unprofitable freight 
in addition  we contracted with fewer independent contractor providers of equipment 
the reduction in fleet size and yield enhancement efforts were consistent with our strategy of focusing on asset productivity 
these factors were offset by an increase in fuel surcharge revenue 
we believe our asset productivity efforts were successful  as our weighted average number of tractors decreased while operating revenue decreased only 
operating revenue  excluding fuel surcharge revenue  decreased million to million in from million in average operating revenue per tractor per week increased significantly to  in from  in operating revenue includes revenue from operating our trucks as well as other  more volatile  revenue items  including fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue 
we believe the analysis of tractor productivity is more meaningful if fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue are excluded from the computation 
average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue increased to  in from  in  primarily due to increased production from our seated equipment and a lower number of unseated company tractors 
for the year  revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue remained relatively constant at as rates were lower in the first half of the year and higher during the latter part of fuel surcharge revenue increased million to million in from million in during and  approximately million and million  respectively  of the fuel surcharge revenue collected helped to offset our fuel costs 
the remainder was passed through to independent contractors 
purchased transportation consists primarily of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment  expenses related to brokerage activities  and payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
purchased transportation decreased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  purchased transportation decreased to in from in the changes reflect a decrease in the percentage of the fleet supplied by independent contractors and in the number of independent contractors 
the percentage of total operating revenue provided by independent contractors decreased to in from in we believe the decline in independent contractors as a percentage of our total fleet is attributable to high fuel costs  high insurance costs  tighter credit standards  and slow freight demand  which diminished the pool of drivers interested in becoming or remaining independent contractors 
the decline in independent contractors has slowed significantly since september  as freight demand and the general economy have improved 
compensation and employee benefits decreased  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  compensation and employee benefits increased to in from in this reflects an increase in workers compensation claims  an increase in the percentage of the fleet comprised of company owned tractors and additional wages paid to new drivers for sign on bonuses implemented to enhance driver recruiting 
additionally  health claims and premiums increased in compared with  and we expect this trend to continue in future periods 
these factors were partially offset by a million decrease in wages paid to non driver employees 
additionally  in  we recorded a  increase in reserves for workers compensation losses  including losses which have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased to of revenue in compared with in this reflects an increase in the percentage of the fleet comprised of company owned tractors  higher fuel prices  and a slight increase in maintenance costs 
fuel prices increased approximately to an average of per gallon in from per gallon in the per gallon increase in fuel prices was partially offset by a per gallon million increase in fuel surcharge revenue attributable to company owned tractors which is included in operating revenue  mitigating of the increase in fuel prices 
insurance and claims decreased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance and claims decreased to of revenue in compared with in  reflecting lower auto liability insurance and claims 
in  insurance and claims also included a million increase in reserves for auto liability losses 
the increase in liability reserves related primarily to a change in estimating the ultimate costs of claims that occurred in prior years and did not recur in in july  due to our financial condition and the rising cost of insurance  we discontinued our excess insurance coverage  leaving million of primary coverage with a  self insured retention  allowing for a substantial reduction in premiums 
we have had a  self insured retention since july  in january  we exercised an option to retroactively increase the deductible for our auto liability policy to  per incident beginning july  through june  which reduced our expense by  no changes were made to the other policies during that period 
prior to that time the retention was  our past lack of excess coverage and our high self insured retention have increased our risk associated with frequency and severity of accidents and has had the potential to increase our expenses or make them more volatile from period to period 
furthermore  claims that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  or for which coverage is not provided  may cause our financial condition and results of operations to suffer a materially adverse effect 
taxes and licenses remained constant at million in and the decrease in the number of company owned tractors subject to annual license and permit costs was offset by an increase in the need for over dimensional permits 
as a percentage of revenue  taxes and licenses remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with of revenue in general and administrative expenses decreased  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses remained constant at of revenue in both years 
communications and utilities decreased  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with of revenue in depreciation and amortization decreased million to million in from million in in accordance with industry practices  the gain or loss on retirement  sale  or write down of equipment is included in depreciation and amortization 
in and  depreciation and amortization included net gains from the sale of equipment of  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to of revenue in compared with in the decreases as a percentage of revenue were attributable to a smaller fleet of company owned equipment 
also  some of our older equipment still generates revenue but is no longer being depreciated 
in the short term  we expect that the presence of older equipment which is not being depreciated will more than offset increases in depreciation resulting from the addition of new equipment to our fleet 
over the long term  as we continue to upgrade our equipment fleet  we expect depreciation expense to increase 
in  we recorded million for goodwill impairment 
there was no impairment of goodwill in or interest expense  net  decreased  to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to lower average debt outstanding  partially offset by higher interest rates 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense  net  remained constant at of revenue in both and as a result of the foregoing  our pre tax margin increased to in from in our income tax benefit in was million  or of loss before income taxes 
our income tax benefit in was million  or of loss before income taxes 
in both years  the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate for a company headquartered in iowa because of the cost of nondeductible driver per diem expense absorbed by us 
the impact of paying per diem travel expenses varies depending upon the ratio of drivers to independent contractors and the level of our pre tax loss 
as a result of the factors described above  net loss was million in of revenue  compared with net loss of million in of revenue 
liquidity and capital resources uses and sources of cash we require cash to fund working capital requirements and to service our debt 
we have historically financed acquisitions of new equipment with borrowings under installment notes payable to commercial lending institutions and equipment manufacturers  borrowings under lines of credit  cash flow from operations  and equipment leases from third party lessors 
we also have obtained a portion of our revenue equipment fleet from independent contractors who own and operate the equipment  which reduces overall capital expenditure requirements compared with providing a fleet of entirely company owned equipment 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations and borrowings under credit arrangements with financial institutions and equipment manufacturers 
we are experiencing improved cash flow as we have returned to profitability 
as of the date of this report  we have adequate borrowing availability on our line of credit to finance any near term needs for working capital 
at december   we had negative working capital of million 
profits in turned our working capital to a positive million at december  working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities is not always fully representative of our liquidity position because cash and trade receivables account for a large portion of our current assets 
our trade accounts receivable are generally collected within days 
alternatively  current maturities of long term debt  a large portion of our current liabilities  are paid over one year 
for this reason  a negative working capital position does not always represent liquidity problems for our company 
our ability to fund cash requirements in future periods will depend on our ability to comply with covenants contained in financing arrangements and the availability of other financing options  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
our financial condition and results of operations will depend on insurance and claims experience  general shipping demand by our customers  fuel prices  the availability of drivers and independent contractors  continued success in implementing the profit improvement plan described above  and other factors 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that cash generated by operations and available sources of financing for acquisitions of revenue equipment will be adequate to meet our currently anticipated working capital requirements and other cash needs through we will require additional sources of financing over the long term to upgrade our tractor and trailer fleets 
to the extent that actual results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely affected and we may be unable to meet our financial covenants 
specifically  our short and long term liquidity may be adversely affected by one or more of the following factors costs associated with insurance and claims  weak freight demand or a loss in customer relationships or volume  the impact of new hours of service regulations on asset productivity  the ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and independent contractors  elevated fuel prices and the ability to collect fuel surcharges  inability to maintain compliance with  or negotiate amendments to  loan covenants  the ability to finance the tractors and trailers delivered and scheduled for delivery  and the possibility of shortened payment terms by our suppliers and vendors worried about our ability to meet payment obligations 
based upon our improving results  anticipated future cash flows  current availability under the financing arrangement with lasalle bank  and sources of equipment financing that are available  we do not expect to experience significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
to the extent that actual results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely affected and we may be unable to meet our financial covenants 
in such event  we believe we could renegotiate the terms of our debt or that alternative financing would be available  although this cannot be assured 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
historically  our principal use of cash from operations is to service debt and to internally finance acquisitions of revenue equipment 
total receivables decreased increased million   and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the average age of our trade accounts receivable was approximately days for  days for  and days for net cash provided by investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
such amounts related primarily to sales of revenue equipment and terminal facilities 
net cash used in financing activities of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  consisted primarily of net payments of principal under our long term debt agreements 
we have a financing arrangement with lasalle bank  which expires on january   and provides for automatic month to month renewals under certain conditions after that date 
lasalle may terminate the arrangement prior to january   in the event of default  and may terminate at the end of any renewal term 
the agreement provides for a term loan  a revolving line of credit  and a capital expenditure loan 
the term loan has a balance of  and is payable in equal monthly installments of in principal 
the revolving line of credit allows for borrowings up to percent of eligible receivables 
at december   total borrowings under the revolving line were the capital expenditure loan allows for borrowing up to percent of the purchase price of revenue equipment purchased with such advances provided borrowings under the capital expenditure loan are limited to  annually and  over the term of the agreement 
the capital expenditure loan has a balance of and is payable in equal monthly installments of in principal 
the combination of all loans with lasalle bank cannot exceed the lower of  or a specified borrowing base 
the financing arrangement also includes financing for letters of credit 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling  for self insured amounts under our insurance programs 
we are required to pay an annual fee of of the outstanding letters of credit 
these letters of credit directly reduce the amount of potential borrowings available under the financing arrangement discussed above 
any increase in self insured retention  as well as increases in claim reserves  may require additional letters of credit to be posted  which would negatively affect our liquidity 
at december   our borrowing limit under the financing arrangement was  leaving  in remaining availability at such date 
we are required to pay a facility fee on the lasalle financing arrangement of 
of the maximum loan limit million 
borrowings under the arrangement are secured by liens on revenue equipment  accounts receivable  and certain other assets 
the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the arrangement is equal to a spread on lasalle s prime rate or libor  at our option 
the spread is determined by our ratio of funded debt to ebitda  as defined under the agreement 
the lasalle financing arrangement requires compliance with certain financial covenants  including compliance with a minimum tangible net worth  capital expenditure limits  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with these requirements at december  we believe we will maintain compliance with all covenants throughout  although there can be no assurance that the required financial performance will be achieved 
in addition  equipment financing provided by a manufacturer contains a minimum tangible net worth requirement 
we were in compliance with the required minimum tangible net worth requirement for december  and we expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
if we fail to maintain compliance with these financial covenants  or to obtain a waiver of any noncompliance  the lenders will have the right to declare all sums immediately due and pursue other remedies 
in such event  we believe we could renegotiate the terms of our debt or that alternative financing would be available  although this cannot be assured 
as of the filing date  we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables set forth the contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments in thousands due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt     operating leases     total     approximately of our long term debt carries a variable interest rate making reliable estimates of future interest payments difficult 
using our weighted average interest rate of as of december   the following approximately represents our expected obligations for future interest payments payments in thousands due by period less than more than total year years years years total interest payments    we had no outstanding orders for new equipment on december  in january we placed orders with equipment manufactures for new tractors and new trailers to be delivered throughout the orders for trailers can be cancelled at any time without penalty prior to taking delivery 
the orders for tractors can be cancelled without penalty at any time up to days prior to production of the tractor 
if the termination occurs less than days  but more than days prior to production  we retain the right to cancel subject to a minimal per truck penalty of orders generally cannot be cancelled within days prior to production 
we had no other commercial commitments at december  off balance sheet arrangements our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
during the last six months of we leased new tractors under operating leases 
these new leases will increase equipment rent expense  a component of purchased transportation expense  in future periods 
our obligations under non cancelable operating lease agreements are as follows  million   million   million   million    thereafter  these obligations exclude potential terminal remainder adjustment clause trac payments or refunds on tractors amounting to of the original purchase price due at the end of the original month term of the lease 
after months  we expect the residual value of the tractors to be greater than of the original cost  allowing us to return the tractors without penalty 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors we consider as relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures 
changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note of the consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
other footnotes describe various elements of the financial statements and the assumptions on which specific amounts were determined 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we generally recognize operating revenue when the freight to be transported has been loaded 
we operate primarily in the short to medium length haul category of the trucking industry  therefore  our typical customer delivery is completed one day after pickup 
accordingly  this method of revenue recognition is not materially different from recognizing revenue based on completion of delivery 
we recognize operating revenue when the freight is delivered for longer haul loads where delivery is completed more than one day after pickup 
amounts payable to independent contractors for purchased transportation  to company drivers for wages  and other direct expenses are accrued when the related revenue is recognized 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided by use of the straight line and declining balance methods over lives of to years for buildings and improvements  years for tractors  years for trailers  and to years for other equipment 
tires purchased as part of revenue equipment are capitalized as a cost of the equipment 
replacement tires are expensed when placed in service 
expenditures for maintenance and minor repairs are charged to operations  and expenditures for major replacements and betterments are capitalized 
the cost and related accumulated depreciation on property and equipment retired  traded  or sold are eliminated from the property accounts at the time of retirement  trade  or sale 
the gain or loss on retirement or sale is included in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operation 
gains on trade ins are included in the basis of the new asset 
judgments concerning salvage values and useful lives can have a significant impact 
estimated liability for insurance claims losses resulting from auto liability  physical damage  workers compensation  and cargo loss and damage are covered by insurance subject to certain self retention levels 
losses resulting from uninsured claims are recognized when such losses are incurred 
we estimate and accrue a liability for our share of ultimate settlements using all available information 
we accrue for claims reported  as well as for claims incurred but not reported  based upon our past experience 
expenses depend on actual loss experience and changes in estimates of settlement amounts for open claims which have not been fully resolved 
however  final settlement of these claims could differ materially from the amounts we have accrued at year end 
our judgment concerning the ultimate cost of claims and modification of initial reserved amounts is an important part of establishing claims reserves  and is of increasing significance with higher self insured retention and lack of excess coverage 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
our judgment concerning future cash flows is an important part of this determination 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell

this statement sfas r is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services through share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
for public companies that file as small business issuers  sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after december  while we cannot precisely determine the impact on net earnings as a result of the adoption of sfas r  estimated compensation expense related to current and prior periods can be found in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the ultimate amount of increased compensation expense will be dependent on whether we adopt sfas r using the modified prospective or retrospective method  the number of option shares granted during the year  their timing and vesting period  and the method used to calculate the fair value of the awards  among other factors 
inflation and fuel costs most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices  the compensation paid to drivers  and fuel prices 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
we attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
the failure to obtain rate increases in the future could adversely affect profitability 
high fuel prices also decrease our profitability 
most of our contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although we attempt to pass through increases in fuel prices to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  the fuel price increases are not fully recovered 
seasonality in the trucking industry results of operations show a seasonal pattern because customers generally reduce shipments during the winter season  and we experience some seasonality due to the open  flatbed nature of the majority of our trailers 
we at times have experienced delays in meeting shipment schedules as a result of severe weather conditions  particularly during the winter months 
in addition  our operating expenses have been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs in colder weather 
factors that may affect future results we may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements 
written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
we rely on this safe harbor in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  we hereby identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by us or on our behalf 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following general economic and business factors 
our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include excess capacity in the trucking industry  significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates  fuel taxes  and insurance and claims costs  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates or fuel surcharges 
our results of operations also are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries in which we have a concentration of customers 
in addition  our results of operations are affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments during the winter months 
fuel prices have continued to rise throughout and shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices  or rationing of petroleum products could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
capital requirements 
the trucking industry is very capital intensive 
historically  we have depended on cash from operations  equipment financing  and debt financing for funds to update our revenue equipment fleet 
beginning in  we began to upgrade our tractor fleet 
going forward we will need to continue to upgrade our tractor and trailer fleets 
we expect to pay for the projected capital expenditures and or operating leases with cash flows from operations and borrowings from equipment manufacturers or under the financing arrangement with lasalle bank 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms in the future  we may have to enter into less favorable financing arrangements or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability 
revenue equipment 
going forward  as we continue to upgrade our equipment fleet  we expect depreciation and or equipment rent expense  a component of purchased transportation expense  to increase 
if revenue production were to decrease  the increased depreciation and or rent could have a materially adverse effect on operating results 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers and independent contractors 
competition for drivers and independent contractors is intense in the trucking industry 
there is  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers and independent contractors 
we have successfully reduced the number of company owned tractors without drivers during and by improving recruiting and retention of drivers and by disposing of unseated equipment 
in addition  independent contractors have decreased industry wide for a variety of economic reasons 
failure to recruit additional drivers and independent contractors could force us to increase compensation or limit fleet size  either of which could have a materially adverse effect on operating results 
competition 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with other truckload carriers  private fleets operated by existing and potential customers  and to some extent railroads and rail intermodal service 
competition is based primarily on service  efficiency  and freight rates 
many competitors offer transportation service at lower rates than us 
our results could suffer if we cannot obtain higher rates 
insurance 
our limited amount of excess coverage and high self insured retention increases our risk associated with the frequency and severity of accidents and could increase our expenses or make them more volatile from period to period 
furthermore  if we experience claims that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  or if we experience claims for which coverage is not provided  our financial condition and results of operations could suffer a materially adverse effect 
in february  we reinstated excess insurance coverage for losses above our primary policy limit of million up to million 
the cost of this excess insurance will increase our insurance premiums in the future but provides protection against unusually large claims 
regulation 
the trucking industry is subject to various governmental regulations 
effective january   the dot established new hours of service rules which effectively reduced the hours in service during which a driver may operate a tractor by redefining periods of service 
the epa has promulgated air emission standards that have increased the cost of tractor engines and reduce fuel mileage 
although we are unable to predict the nature of any new regulations or changes in existing regulations  the cost of any changes  if implemented  may adversely affect our profitability 
acquisitions 
we have made no acquisitions of companies during the past three years 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the acquired company s operations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the risks of entering into markets in which management has no or only limited direct experience  and the potential loss of customers  key employees and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we make any acquisitions in the future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired companies or assets into our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  most importantly the effects of the price and availability of diesel fuel and changes in interest rates 
commodity price risk our operations are heavily dependent upon the use of diesel fuel 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can vary and are subject to political  economic  and market factors that are beyond our control 
significant increases in diesel fuel prices could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we presently use fuel surcharges to address the risk of increasing fuel prices 
we believe these fuel surcharges are an effective means of mitigating the risk of increasing fuel prices  although the competitive nature of our industry prevents us from recovering the full amount of fuel price increases through the use of such surcharges 
in the past  we have used derivative instruments  including heating oil price swap agreements  to reduce a portion of our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
since we have had no such agreements in place 
we do not trade in such derivatives with the objective of earning financial gains on price fluctuations 
interest rate risk we also are exposed to market risks from changes in certain interest rates on our debt 
our financing arrangement with lasalle bank provides for a variable interest rate based on lasalle s prime rate plus basis points  provided there has been no default 
in addition  approximately million of our other debt carries variable interest rates 
this variable interest exposes us to the risk that interest rates may rise 
assuming borrowing levels at december   a one point increase in the prime rate would increase annual interest expense by approximately  the remainder of our other debt carries fixed interest rates 
at december   approximately of our debt carried a variable interest rate and the remainder was fixed
