the forged and cast rolls segment consists of union electric steel corporation union electric steel  the world s largest manufacturer of forged hardened steel rolls with its principal operations in pennsylvania and indiana  and davy roll company limited davy roll  a manufacturer of cast rolls which has manufacturing facilities in england 
rolls are supplied to the metals industry principally to steel producers throughout the world 
more than half of the annual sales are shipped to destinations outside the segment s own domestic borders 
the air and liquid processing segment consists of aerofin corporation aerofin  buffalo air handling company buffalo air handling and buffalo pumps  inc buffalo pumps 
aerofin and buffalo air handling have operations in virginia and buffalo pumps is located in new york 
aerofin produces heat exchange coils for a variety of users including hvac  power generation  industrial process and other manufacturing industries 
buffalo air handling produces custom designed air handling systems for commercial  institutional and industrial building markets 
buffalo pumps manufactures centrifugal pumps for the defense  refrigeration and power generation industries 
the segment distributes a significant portion of its products through a common independent group of sales offices located throughout the us during  the forged and cast rolls segment benefited from resurgence in the global steel industry and the weaker dollar which improved export business particularly with china  india and other growing economies and  by year end  produced the largest order backlog in the history of the segment 
unfortunately  the operations continued to be impacted by increased costs of natural gas and unprecedented escalation in the cost of raw materials which  in part  were not recovered in pricing as a result of fixed price contracts 
in addition  significant losses were incurred by davy roll 
production at the carnegie  pennsylvania forged roll finishing plant was disrupted  including loss of sales  by flooding caused by the remnants of hurricane ivan 
the corporation expects to settle a business interruption insurance claim in the first part of the outlook for is for expected improvement in the latter part of the year as the segment progressively works through its backlog and increased pricing and raw material and energy surcharges flow through to operating results 
new machinery brought on line late in at davy roll will also begin to contribute to operational improvements and add needed capacity 
the curtailment of the uk defined benefit plan as of december   which was replaced with a defined contribution plan  is expected to contain growth in pension liabilities and stabilize employer contributions 
the air and liquid processing segment generally lags any downturn in the economy  accordingly  the segment was not affected by the weak economy until  which continued through similarly  any recovery will not immediately improve operating results 
in particular  demand for lube oil pumps is expected to remain at low levels for the foreseeable future due to an oversupply of gas turbines 
the segment is also being impacted by higher material costs  the slowdown in the construction industry particularly related to the pharmaceutical  institutional and health care markets  and the resulting decline in margins following aggressive pricing by competitors as a reduced level of potential business is pursued 
product offerings have been expanded but no significant improvement is expected until capital spending by the manufacturing sector improves 
while management continues to spend a significant amount of time defending the corporation against claims for personal injury alleged to result from asbestos containing product manufactured as many as sixty years ago  out of pockets costs have decreased from previous years as a larger portion of such costs are covered by insurance

ampco pittsburgh annual report the nature and scope of the corporation s business brings it into regular contact with a variety of persons  businesses and government agencies in the ordinary course of business

effects of inflation while inflationary and market pressures on costs are likely to be experienced in  it is anticipated that ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and cost savings efforts will mitigate the effects of inflation on operating results 
application of critical accounting policies the corporation has identified critical accounting policies that are important to the presentation of the corporation s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations and involve the most complex or subjective assessments 
critical accounting policies relate to accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits  assessing recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  environmental matters and income taxes 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  input from the corporation s actuary is evaluated and extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality  turnover and discount rates 
specifically  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an estimate of average rates of earnings expected to be earned on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
since these benefits will be paid out over many years  the expected long term rate of return is reflective of current investment returns and investment returns over a longer period 
consideration is also given to historical rates of return 
for the domestic plans  the average rates of return earned on the market related value of plan assets by the corporation averaged for the five year period of  and for the ten year period of accordingly  the corporation believes the expected long term rate of return of for its domestic plans as of december  to be reasonable 
the foreign plan was formed in connection with the acquisition of the uk operations with plan assets transferred from the seller s plan to the newly created plan in october as a result  similar historical experience for rates of return specific to the plan is not available 
instead  the expected long term rate of return for the foreign plan is estimated based on the historical average returns earned by each of the asset classes in the plan 
the corporation believes the assumed long term rate of return of as of december  to be reasonable 
the discount rates utilized in determining future pension obligations and other postretirement benefits for each of the plans are based on rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension and other postretirement benefits 
high quality fixed income investments are defined as those investments which have received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency with maturities of years 
the corporation believes the assumed rates of and as of december  for its domestic and u 
k plans  respectively  to be reasonable 
the corporation believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are based on appropriate assumptions although actual outcomes could differ 
a percentage point decrease in the rate of return would increase annual pension expense by approximately  a percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase projected and accumulated benefit obligations by approximately  see note to consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable as outlined in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets are less than their carrying value  then the asset value may not be fully recoverable potentially resulting in a write down of the asset value 
estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions over the remaining useful life of the primary asset s 
accordingly  assumptions are made about pricing  volume and asset resale values 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
the corporation believes the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for property  plant and equipment are recoverable and are not impaired as of december  ampco pittsburgh annual report goodwill is no longer amortized but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually in connection with the corporation s strategic planning process 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information and represents the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions  pricing and volume 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
the corporation believes the amount recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for goodwill of  is recoverable and is not impaired as of december  environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required  and identification of new sites 
the corporation believes the potential liability for all environmental proceedings based on information known to date has been adequately reserved see note to consolidated financial statements

ampco pittsburgh annual report item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the corporation views its primary market risk exposures to relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
to manage certain foreign currency exchange exposures  the corporation s policy is to hedge a portion of its foreign currency denominated sales and receivables primarily us sales denominated in euros and foreign sales denominated in us dollars and euros 
although strengthening of the us dollar could result in a lower volume of exports from the us and at reduced margins  it is expected that exports for the corporation s foreign operation would increase and gross margins would improve 
additionally  strengthening of the british pound could result in a lower volume of exports from the uk and at reduced margins  however  it is expected that exports for the corporation s domestic operations would increase and gross margins would improve 
accordingly  a strengthening of either of the entities functional currency the us dollar and the british pound is not expected to have a significant effect on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
to reduce the effect of price changes for certain of its raw materials  the corporation enters into futures contracts for a particular commodity and purchases a portion of its alloys in advance 
based on estimated annual purchases  a fluctuation in commodity prices including electricity  natural gas  scrap and alloys would have approximately a  impact 
the ability to pass these increases on to the customer is contingent upon current market conditions with the corporation having to absorb a significant portion of such increase
