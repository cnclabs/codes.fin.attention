in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties

overview our business and business segments we are a leading global provider of investment processing  fund processing  and investment management business outsourcing solutions that help corporations  financial institutions  financial advisors  and affluent families create and manage wealth 
our outsourcing business solutions consist mainly of investment processing  fund processing  and investment management 
investment processing fees are earned as monthly fees for contracted services including computer processing services  software licenses  and trust operations services  as well as transaction based fees for providing securities valuation and trade execution 
fund processing and investment management fees are earned as a percentage of average assets under management or administration 
as of december   through our subsidiaries and partnership in which we have a significant interest  we administered over billion in mutual fund and pooled assets  managed over billion in assets  and operate offices in countries 
we conduct business through five business segments offering our business solutions to specific target markets 
these business segments are private banking and trust provides investment processing  fund processing  and investment management programs to banks and other trust institutions located in the united states and canada and accounted for percent of consolidated revenues in  investment advisors provides investment management programs to affluent investors through a network of independent registered investment advisors  financial planners  and other investment professionals in the united states and accounted for percent of consolidated revenues in  enterprises provides retirement and treasury solutions to corporations  unions  municipalities  and hospitals  and an endowment and foundation solution for the not for profit market in the united states and accounted for ten percent of consolidated revenues in  money managers provides investment processing and fund processing to investment managers and mutual fund companies in the united states and to investment managers worldwide of alternative asset classes such as hedge funds  fund of funds  and private equity funds and accounted for percent of consolidated revenues in  and investments in new businesses provides investment management programs and fund processing to investment advisors  corporations  and money managers located outside the united states and private banking outsource solutions to institutions in the united kingdom and continental europe 
this segment also includes our investment management programs offered to affluent families who reside in the united states 
this segment accounted for percent of consolidated revenues in page of recent highlights our revenues for were million  with net income of million and diluted earnings per share of 
we believe the following items were significant to our business during revenue growth during was affected by higher levels of assets under management and administration 
the contributors to this growth were rising capital markets during and part of and assets from sales of new business 
a significant portion of our revenues are earned from the assets we manage and administer 
rising capital markets increased the value of assets we manage and administer for our existing clients  causing our base revenues to increase 
our new sales which generated or will generate revenues in the current or future periods primarily came from our private banking and trust  enterprises  money managers and investments in new businesses segments 
we believe that these new sales were due to a growing acceptance of our existing and new solutions in our target markets 
net income during the year was primarily boosted by our investment in lsv 
lsv reported significant growth in revenues and earnings during  mainly as a result of new sales 
we currently have a percent ownership interest in lsv 
we also sold a small portion of our interest in lsv to certain other partners of lsv which generated a one time gain of million 
lsv contributed approximately percent of our growth in earnings 
we continued to make significant investments in the development of our global wealth management platform 
we believe the development of this platform is critical to the future expansion of our business and to the launch of a private bank operations outsourcing business in europe 
in addition  by having a single platform  we anticipate achieving significant development and operational leverage 
we are currently in the development phase of the platform and expect these development expenditures will continue throughout and beyond 
we capitalized million in as compared to million in of software development costs for this platform 
our private banking and trust segment continued to face strategic challenges in the large bank market 
we absorbed the loss of a large bank mutual fund complex during in this segment  the mutual fund processing business has seen substantial fee and margin compression 
also  some recent large bank mergers negatively impacted our investment processing business 
as a result of these bank mergers  we lost clients which had contributed significantly to our revenues 
while we gained new business from other bank mergers and acquisitions  this new business has not replaced these lost revenues 
finally  in  a significant competitor announced their intention to exit the investment processing business 
the clients of this competitor have been seeking a new outsourcing partner  and several of these institutions have selected sei 
we are competing aggressively for the remaining undecided banks 
we continued our stock repurchase program during and purchased approximately million shares at an average price of almost per share 
this caused our diluted earnings per share to grow at a faster rate than our earnings 
forward looking items we believe our investments in new product development will allow us to expand our markets and to offer new solutions within existing markets 
however  our future growth depends on our ability to develop the global wealth management platform and to implement this platform cost effectively into our operations 
if we are unable to execute our plan  future revenues and earnings could be significantly affected 
a significant portion of our revenues are based upon the market value of assets we manage or administer 
a decline in the market value of these assets as a result of changes in market conditions  the general economy or other factors will negatively impact our revenues and earnings 
merger and acquisition activity within our target markets is a major strategic issue for us 
consolidations between banks and other financial institutions could reduce our existing client base and the number of potential clients 
this activity may also cause larger institutions to internalize some or all of our services 
these factors may negatively impact our ability to generate future growth in revenues and earnings 
employee stock options are a significant component of our overall compensation structure 
the requirements of a new accounting pronouncement  sfas r  which will become effective in the third quarter of  will increase our personnel compensation expense and negatively impact our earnings

consolidated our revenues increased million  or nine percent  to million in compared to  and increased million  or one percent  to million in compared to the rise in our revenues in both comparable periods was primarily driven by increased asset based fees due to higher levels of assets under management and administration from market appreciation in the value of assets managed and administered for our existing clients and assets from sales of new business in the enterprises  money managers and investments in new businesses segments 
fund processing fees from offshore and hedge funds increased significantly in both periods  mainly due to new client sales but were substantially offset by reduced fund processing fees earned from bank clients because of the loss of large bank clients in and brokerage fees declined in due to the recognition of significant non recurring brokerage fees from manager transitions in and the diminishing demand for soft dollar services by our clients 
our income from operations increased million in  or two percent  after declining million  or two percent  in compared to operating margin declined to percent in after declining to percent in from percent in the increase in operating income in was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues 
operating income and margins in both periods were negatively impacted by an increased level of non capitalized investment spending in our technology and infrastructure for supporting new business solutions as well as our continued global expansion and life and wealth program development 
a large portion of this investment spending was for the global wealth management platform 
the increase in new sales also caused an increase in personnel compensation  mainly sales and incentive compensation in both comparable periods 
income from operations did benefit from lower costs associated with the fund processing and brokerage services businesses that were directly tied to the decrease in revenues

page of other general and administrative expenses year ended december  percent change percent change general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily consist of corporate overhead costs and other costs not directly attributable to one of our business segments 
the increase in these expenses was primarily due to modifications to enhance our compliance procedures  resources devoted to complying with new regulations of the sarbanes oxley act of which became effective in  and higher costs for general insurance coverage

the increase in lsv s net earnings is due to an increase in assets under management mainly from new business 
other income in includes a non recurring million gain from the sale of a small portion of our equity interest in lsv to certain other partners of lsv see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net gain loss from investments consists of year ended december  net realized gain loss from sales of marketable securities increase decrease in fair value of derivative financial instruments other than temporary declines in market value other realized gains losses net gain loss on investments derivative financial instruments are used to minimize the price risk associated with changes in the fair value of our seed investments in new investment management programs 
these derivative financial investments did not qualify for hedge accounting under current accounting rules 
as a result  changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments were recorded in current period earnings whereas the change in the fair value of the hedged asset will be realized upon sale in future period earnings 
our decision to enter into derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting may cause volatility in quarterly earnings 
page of we perform a review of all investments in marketable securities on a quarterly basis with regards to impairment 
factors considered in determining other than temporary impairment are significant or prolonged declines in the price of investments based on available market prices 
additional consideration is given to the ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment 
other realized gains losses in include the write down of approximately million of an equity investment carried at cost in a private technology firm 
interest income is earned based upon the amount of cash that is invested daily 
fluctuations in interest income recognized for one period in relation to another is due to changes in the average cash balance invested for the period and or changes in interest rates 
interest expense is directly attributable to our long term debt and other borrowings 
interest expense in decreased due to the lower principal balances of debt outstanding 
income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in both and  and percent in the rate reduction in  compared to  was due to an increase in the amount of research and development expenditures for which we are claiming a tax credit and a reassessment of valuation allowance for capital losses 
certain expenditures associated with research and development which qualified for a tax credit reduced our tax liability and effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  beginning of year cash and cash equivalents  end of year cash requirements and liquidity needs are expected to be funded through our cash flow from operations and our capacity for additional borrowing 
we currently have a credit facility that provides for borrowings of up to million 
the availability of the credit facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants set forth in the agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   our unused sources of liquidity consisted of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and the credit facility of million 
net cash provided by operating activities grew million in and million in from the prior comparable years primarily from an increase in income 
the increase in also included additional deferred taxes mainly due to the higher amount of software development costs eligible for capitalization and currently deductible for tax purposes 
net cash from operating activities in both comparable periods was negatively affected by a decline in the tax benefit received from stock option exercises  an increase in undistributed earnings from lsv and the net change in our working capital accounts  mainly receivables and accrued expenses 
page of net cash used in investing activities primarily includes the purchases and sales of available for sale securities  the capitalization of costs incurred in developing computer software  and capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities decreased about million in and increased million in as compared to the prior year period 
purchases and sales of our mutual funds and other securities are mainly for the testing and subsequent start up of new investment programs to be offered to our clients 
the length of time that we remain invested in these new investment programs is dependent on client subscriptions 
we will redeem our investments as clients subscribe to these new investment programs 
in  we had million in net redemptions of available for sale securities  million in net purchases of available for sale securities in  and million in net redemptions of available for sale securities in during the past several years  we have been investing in the development of our new global wealth management platform 
many of these expenditures were not eligible for capitalization until as we progress through the project  a larger portion of our expenditures are for development  rather than research and design  and are eligible for capitalization under accounting rules 
capitalized software expenditures were million in  million in and million in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures in and for property and equipment included significant costs related to the expansion of our corporate headquarters 
construction on the new buildings was completed in early which resulted in a decrease of million in capital expenditures during net cash used in financing activities primarily includes principal payments on our debt  the repurchase of our common stock  and dividend payments 
principal payments on our long term debt were million in  million in and million in our long term debt is subject to various covenants contained in each lending agreement 
currently  these covenants do not negatively affect our liquidity 
during  our million day credit facility expired and was replaced with a new three year million credit facility 
the three year credit facility was generated through a syndicate of lenders and may be used for general corporate purposes  including the repurchase of our common stock see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of our common stock of up to million  which includes an additional authorization of million on february  as of february   we still had million of authorization remaining for the purchase of our common stock under this program see note to the consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
we believe that the following accounting policies require extensive judgment by our management to determine the recognition and timing of amounts recorded in our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in the periods in which the related services are performed provided that pervasive evidence of an agreement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
cash received by us in advance of the performance of services is deferred and recognized as revenue when earned 
our principal sources of revenues are information processing and software servicing fees that are recurring in nature and earned based on the number of trust accounts being serviced  transaction based fees for providing securities valuation and trade execution services and non recurring project fees that are determined upon contractual agreements  and asset management  administration and distribution fees calculated as a percentage of the total average daily net assets under management or administration 
the majority of our revenues are based on contractual arrangements and do not require judgment by management 
certain portions of our revenues do require management s consideration to determine the amount and timing of recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our clients to make their scheduled payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is primarily based on an aging analysis of the total outstanding receivables balance at each balance sheet date 
other factors are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  such as historical trends  the financial condition of our clients and other factors that may be deemed appropriate 
based upon this analysis  the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted to an amount that is sufficient to cover expected losses from doubtful accounts 
page of investments available for sale we value our investments in marketable securities based on quoted market prices 
we review our investments in marketable securities on a quarterly basis with regard to impairment 
factors considered in determining other than temporary impairment are significant or prolonged declines in the fair value of our investments  our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period sufficient to allow the value to recover  and the financial condition of the investment 
after considering these factors  if we believe that a decline is other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value through current period earnings 
computer software development costs we utilize internally developed computer software as part of our product offering 
in the development of a new software product  substantial consideration must be given by management to determine whether costs incurred are research and development costs  or internal software development costs eligible for capitalization 
management must consider a number of different factors during their evaluation of each computer software development project that includes estimates and assumptions 
costs considered to be research and development are expensed as incurred 
after meeting certain requirements  internal software development costs are capitalized as incurred 
the recoverability of capitalized computer software development costs requires considerable judgment by management which includes  but is not limited to  an evaluation of expected future revenues and cash flows  acceptability of the product in the market  the ability to support the product in a cost effective manner  technological enhancements and any other factor deemed appropriate 
if management determines that certain software products are considered either obsolete or incapable of producing sustainable future cash flows  an impairment charge would be required 
the amount of the impairment charge would be based on estimates of the software s anticipated future cash flows compared to its book value 
income tax accounting the computation of our income tax expense requires the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations in many taxing jurisdictions around the world 
actual income tax expense can differ significantly from our estimates 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on our estimated future taxable income and tax strategies 
we also recognize a liability for expected future tax contingencies 
we assess the liability based on our review of various tax issues and interpretations of tax law 
differences between our estimates and actual results could have a significant impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
the assessment of critical accounting policies is not meant to be an all inclusive discussion of the uncertainties to financial results that can occur from the application of the full range of our accounting policies 
materially different financial results could occur in the application of other accounting policies as well 
also  materially different results can occur upon the adoption of new accounting standards 
new accounting pronouncements see the discussion of new accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
page of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
our excess cash is principally invested in short term  highly liquid financial instruments  mainly money market funds  with a substantial portion of such investments having initial maturities of three months or less 
our investment portfolio also includes some long term fixed income mutual funds  principally invested in federal government agency securities 
we place our investments in financial instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
a portion of our long term debt is based upon a variable rate which renews every three months 
while changes in interest rates could decrease interest income or increase interest expense  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to changes in interest rates 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  marketable securities and trade receivables 
cash deposits are maintained with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits 
cash equivalents are principally invested in short term money market funds or placed with major banks and high credit qualified financial institutions 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to our receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and their dispersion across geographic areas 
no single customer represents greater than ten percent of total accounts receivable 
foreign currency risk we transact business in the local currencies of various foreign countries  principally canada  ireland  the united kingdom and south korea 
the total of all of our foreign operations accounts for approximately percent of total consolidated revenues 
also  most of our foreign operations match local currency revenues with local currency costs 
due to these reasons  we do not hedge against foreign operations 
price risk we are exposed to price risk associated with changes in the fair value of investments in marketable securities relating to the startup of new pooled investment offerings 
the length of time that our funds remain invested in these new pooled investment offerings is dependent on client subscriptions 
we will redeem our investments as clients subscribe to these new investment offerings 
to provide protection against potential fair value changes for these investments  we have entered into various derivative financial instruments 
as of december   we held derivative financial instruments with a notional amount of million with terms of less than one year 
changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments are recognized in current period earnings  whereas  the change in the fair value of the investment is recorded on the balance sheet in other comprehensive income 
therefore  changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument and changes in the fair value of the investment are not recognized through earnings in the same period 
we did not enter into or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during or we recorded an impairment charge of million in related to other than temporary declines in the fair value of certain securities held within our investment portfolio 
also  the current period earnings include losses of million and million in and  respectively  relating to changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical ten percent change in the fair value of our investments would be investment hypothetical change in value mutual funds equities in consideration of the hypothetical change in value  our derivative financial instruments related to equities would substantially offset the change in fair value of the equity securities
