item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see forward looking information and risk factors beginning on page strategic and financial repositioning overview overview our repositioning plan is based on improving operational results of our integrated electric and gas utility operations and strengthening our credit profile 
the key elements of our plan are to maintain synergies of an integrated  multi state utility 
significantly reduce our debt levels 
continue to improve operational efficiency and lower earnings variability 
gain access to the capital markets on improved terms  allowing the company to more cost effectively fund investments in its rate base to meet customer needs 
actively work with regulators and legislators to address rate and fuel cost issues 
selectively divest regulated utility assets 
efficiently divest of our interest in remaining three merchant peaking facilities and everest connections and exit our elwood tolling obligation 
this repositioning plan was developed to focus on building and maintaining the generation  transmission and distribution infrastructure necessary to provide our utility customers with safe and reliable service  while increasing the returns on invested capital in jurisdictions that lag behind those of our peers 
we intend to focus on improving our returns through future rate activities and our recently initiated six sigma process improvement program  which we believe will bring our returns closer to those of our peers by the end of asset divestures and strengthen credit profile with a stronger credit profile we will have the opportunity to invest in power generation  transmission and distribution capacity  as well as undertake environmental upgrades over the next decade 
these normal course investments will not only improve the reliability and quality of our utility service  but also provides a platform for additional growth in our earnings and enhanced shareholder value 
following an extensive review and discussion with outside advisors on our stand alone regulated utility strategy  we have retained investment banking advisors to conduct a competitive sale process for certain regulated utility assets 
due to regulatory and price uncertainties associated with the sale of regulated assets  we intend to concurrently conduct a competitive bidding process for utility assets having an aggregate net plant book value of approximately million 
the utilities that will be included in the competitive bidding process are our gas operations in michigan  minnesota and missouri and our electric operations in kansas  colorado and our st 
joseph  missouri service territory 
at the conclusion of this process  we expect to enter into one or more definitive sale agreements to sell a subset of the offered properties 
we will not determine which assets to sell until the conclusion of the competitive bidding process 
among other considerations  our decision will be based on the comparison of the value of the offers versus the value we can build by continuing to own and operate these assets  execution risk through the regulatory approval process  and the opportunity to support the growth of our remaining operations 
we expect to use the proceeds from the sale of regulated utility assets to retire debt and other liabilities 
we currently have more than million of debt obligations that are  or are expected to be callable at par or at a reasonable fixed contractual fee 
having the ability to repurchase debt securities at fixed prices allows us to deploy the proceeds from utility asset divestures efficiently in order to reduce debt and improve our credit profile 
we will also be focused on the divesture of our non regulated assets and contractual requirements 
this includes the continued analysis of the timing of our divesture of the remaining three peaking facilities and everest connections 
additionally  we will continue to pursue the exit of our elwood tolling contract commitments 
the proceeds from the sale of the peaking facilities and everest connections will be applied towards the exit of our elwood tolling contract or to retire debt 
historical review of repositioning efforts in response to significant changes in the energy industry during the past few years  we undertook a strategic review of our business in the second quarter of and announced a change in our strategic direction 
our revised strategy features a concentrated focus on our domestic utility operations  which preceded our diversification into merchant and international arenas in the s 
as part of this repositioning  we took the following actions in began the wind down of our merchant services trading portfolio in north america and europe  sold our natural gas storage facilities in both north america and the united kingdom  sold substantially all of our merchant loan portfolio  sold our gas gathering and processing business located primarily in texas and oklahoma  reduced our investment in quanta services  inc which builds and maintains networks that carry energy and telecommunications from to  sold our equity investment in regulated utility operations in new zealand  and eliminated our quarterly dividend 
separately  we restructured domestic utilities in to more closely align it with its regulatory service areas 
due to our ongoing restructuring efforts since march  we reduced staff by approximately  employees  including those transferred with the sale of various businesses 
of these  were corporate or domestic utilities employees 
in  we continued to execute on our transition plan through the following actions sold our remaining investment in quanta services  inc  sold our australian investments  signed an agreement to sell our united kingdom utility investment  which we completed in january  entered into a million three year secured term loan  terminated our capacity payment obligations under our acadia tolling agreement  signed agreements to sell our canadian utility businesses  which we completed in the second quarter of  signed agreements to sell our equity investment in independent power plants  which we completed in the first half of  pursued rate increases for certain of our gas and electric operations  and continued the wind down of our wholesale energy trading businesses in north america and europe 
in  we continued to implement our restructuring plan through the following actions  among others sold our investment in a merchant power plant development project in the united kingdom  settled rate cases relating to our missouri and colorado electric and missouri and nebraska gas utility operations and pursued rate relief for our kansas electric and gas utility operations  terminated our capacity payment obligations under our aries tolling agreement and exited our investment in the aries merchant power plant  received a distribution on our investment in the baf energy cogeneration project  renewed our day letter of credit facility  sold a non strategic natural gas system located in eastern missouri  terminated four long term natural gas supply contracts  issued million shares of common stock and million of mandatorily convertible senior notes  raising million in net proceeds  retired the million three year secured term loan due in april  entered into a million five year unsecured term loan and a million five year revolving credit facility  and entered into a million six month revolving credit facility secured by the accounts receivable of our regulated operations 
proceeds from these asset sales were used to pay down debt  fund restructuring charges and support our continuing operations 
liquidity and capital resources working capital requirements the most significant activity impacting working capital is the purchase of natural gas for our gas utility customers 
we could experience significant working capital requirements during peak months of the winter heating season due to higher natural gas consumption  potential periods of high natural gas prices and our current requirement to prepay certain gas commodity suppliers and pipeline transportation companies 
under a stressed weather and commodity price environment  we believe this working capital peak could be as high as million 
we anticipate using the combination of our million five year unsecured revolving credit facility  million secured accounts receivable facility and cash on hand to meet the peak winter working capital requirements of our business 
cash flows cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operations were negative due to significant cash impacts resulting primarily from our operating net loss  the exiting of our non core businesses including the termination of four long term gas contracts  and the continued wind down of our merchant services business 
our negative cash flows were driven by the following events and factors we had a net loss from continuing operations of million before income tax benefits  including a million loss related to the termination of four long term gas contracts 
during  we paid a million civil penalty settlement to the cftc related to the reporting of natural gas trading information to publications and we paid million to settle an appraisal rights lawsuit 
higher gas prices in resulted in increased cash payments for the purchase of gas inventory  collateral deposits and gas purchase prepayments for our domestic utilities business 
we made million of net tax payments related to the sale of our consolidated canadian utility operations and other international investments 
offsetting cash outflows in were collateral returns resulting from the continued wind down of our wholesale energy trading positions and contract exits  and depreciation 
our cash flows from operations were negative due to significant cash impacts resulting primarily from our non investment grade credit rating and the continued exit from our wholesale energy trading business 
our negative cash flows were driven by the following events and factors during  we had significant working capital requirements due to our non investment grade credit rating and the resulting changes in vendor payment terms 
we were required to post significant collateral in due to our non investment grade credit rating and increased natural gas prices 
some of our collateral from was returned to us as we continued to exit our energy trading businesses 
however  we were required to cash collateralize our letters of credit under our new letter of credit facility 
we made a million payment to terminate our acadia tolling contract in connection with our restructuring effort to return to operating as a domestic utility 
we made other restructuring payments of million in for severance  retention and other related charges due to our continued exit from the wholesale energy trading business  primarily for severance that had been accrued in and due to our restructuring of everest connections 
higher gas prices in resulted in increased cash payments for the purchase of gas inventory for our utilities 
offsetting cash outflows was the receipt of approximately million of income tax refunds received during the year and depreciation 
our elwood tolling contracts will have a material negative impact on our operating cash flows for the foreseeable future 
we are attempting to restructure or terminate the elwood tolling contracts 
any cash payment made to exit this obligation would have a negative impact on operating cash flows in the year the payment is made  but would improve operating cash flows in future periods 
our significant debt load relative to our overall capitalization and the interest rate we pay on million of our long term debt has substantially increased our interest costs and will continue to negatively impact our operating cash flows 
it will be important for us to substantially improve our operating cash flows 
we are attempting to do this by improving the efficiency of our remaining businesses  increasing sales through utility rates  retiring debt and completing the wind down of our merchant services business 
cash flows from investing activities cash flows provided from investing activities increased in compared to  primarily due to an increase in net proceeds received from the sales of our canadian utility businesses  independent power plants  and midlands electricity 
in  we received proceeds from the sale of our merchant loan portfolio  investments in australia  quanta services  and our gas gathering and pipeline assets 
in addition  we had lower merchant capital expenditures and investments in unconsolidated merchant subsidiaries in compared to  due to the completion of construction of a merchant power plant in june  and the sale of our aries power project in march our utility capital expenditures decreased in due to the sale of our canadian utility businesses in may cash flows provided from investing activities increased in compared to this increase mainly stemmed from reduced capital expenditures in  primarily in the merchant business  as merchant plant construction was significantly completed in we also made a significant investment in midlands electricity in  which did not recur in in addition  in december we sold our merchant loan portfolio which generated net cash outflows in these decreased cash outflows were partially offset by a decrease in cash received from the sale of assets and subsidiary stock in compared to cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities decreased in compared to our net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of cash we paid to retire our short and long term debt obligations and to terminate four of our long term gas contracts  offset in part by the issuance of our common stock  mandatorily convertible pies and our five year unsecured term loan 
in  we retired the midlands electricity acquisition note  our three year secured term loan  our and senior notes  and debt related to our canadian utility operations 
in  we retired the debt associated with our investment in australia and the construction of our merchant power plants 
additionally  we paid million for the termination of our obligations under four long term gas contracts in the funds used to retire debt and terminate our long term gas contracts were provided by investing activities  and the proceeds from our issuance of million shares of common stock  our mandatorily convertible pies and our million five year unsecured term loan 
cash flows from financing activities decreased in compared to our net cash used for financing activities reflects the repayment of short term borrowings and from the reduction of long term debt 
cash flows from financing activities in came primarily from our issuance of common stock and senior notes 
in january  we issued million shares of common stock to the public  which raised approximately million in net proceeds 
we also sold million of senior notes due in march the issuance of million common shares and million of senior notes in july raised approximately million 
we used the proceeds of these issuances primarily to replace the liquidity formerly provided by our accounts receivable sale programs that were terminated in and to retire debt and company obligated preferred securities 
current credit ratings credit ratings impact our ability to obtain short and long term financing  the cost of such financing and vendor payment terms  including collateral and prepayment requirements 
our financial flexibility is limited because of restrictive covenants and other terms that are typically imposed on non investment grade borrowers 
as of december   our senior unsecured long term debt ratings  as assessed by the three major credit rating agencies  were as follows agency rating commentary moody s b stable outlook s p b negative outlook fitch b stable outlook debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agency s opinion of the ability of the issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due 
in general  lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and or impaired ability to borrow 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell  or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
any rating below bbb  for s p and fitch  or baa  for moody s  is considered to be non investment grade and indicates that the security is speculative in nature 
a bb rating  for s p and fitch  or a ba rating  for moody s  indicates that the issuer currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation  however  it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business  financial or economic conditions  which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
an obligation rated b is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated bb or ba  but the obligor currently has capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
adverse business  financial  or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the plus and minus symbols  for s p and fitch  and the  modifiers  for moody s  show relative standing within the major categories  being the highest  or best  modifier in terms of credit quality 
we do not have any trigger events eg  an acceleration of repayment of outstanding indebtedness  an increase in interest costs or the posting of additional cash collateral tied to our stock price and have not executed any transactions that require us to issue equity based on our credit ratings or other trigger events 
if our credit ratings improve to certain levels  the interest rates on million of our long term debt obligations will be lowered 
collateral positions as of december   we had posted collateral for the following in the form of cash or cash collateralized letters of credit in millions trading positions utility cash collateral requirements elwood tolling contract insurance and other total funds on deposit collateral requirements for our remaining trading positions will fluctuate based on the movement in commodity prices and our credit rating 
changes in collateral requirements based on price movements will vary depending on the magnitude of the price movement and the current position of our trading portfolio 
we will receive our posted collateral related to the trading positions as these transactions settle in the future 
we are required to post collateral with certain commodity and pipeline transportation vendors 
this amount will fluctuate depending on gas prices and projected volumetric deliveries 
the ultimate return of this collateral is dependent on the strengthening of our credit profile 
we have been required to post collateral related to our elwood tolling contract until we either successfully restructure the contract or obtain investment grade credit ratings from certain major rating agencies 
we will not be required to post any additional collateral related to this contract 
contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations include maturities of long term debt  cash payments for our two remaining long term gas contracts  minimum payments on operating leases and regulated power  gas and coal purchase contracts  as well as the elwood tolling contracts and merchant gas transportation obligations 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these obligations 
the amounts of contractual cash obligations maturing in each of the next five years and thereafter are shown below in millions thereafter total long term debt obligations a long term gas contracts lease and maintenance obligations elwood tolling contracts merchant gas transportation obligations regulated purchase obligations total  a long term debt obligations maturing in does not include the non cash  mandatory conversion of million of pies to common stock on september  long term gas contracts we accounted for the advance cash payments we received under these contracts as liabilities 
we reduce our obligation for these long term gas contracts as the gas is delivered to the customer under the units of revenue method 
if we were to default on these obligations  or were unable to perform on them  we would be required to pay the issuers of the surety bonds or the counterparties on these arrangements approximately million 
this amount is greater than the long term gas contract balance on our consolidated balance sheet due to our use of the units of revenue method versus a present value method applied under the default provisions of the contractual agreements 
we do not intend to terminate these remaining contracts 
elwood tolling contracts because it is generally expected that the fuel and start up costs of operating the elwood power plant will exceed the revenues that would be generated from the power sales  during the foreseeable future  we believe that our capacity to generate power from the elwood power plant will largely be unutilized 
before including existing forward sales contracts  we expect to incur pretax losses and negative operating cash flows of approximately million in related to these contracts 
we are attempting to terminate or restructure this obligation 
off balance sheet arrangements the term off balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity that we do not consolidate is a party  under which we have i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract  derivative instrument or variable interest  or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support for such assets 
as of december   we have obligations under certain off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that may be material to investors 
these are discussed below 
merchant loan portfolio in connection with our former portfolio of merchant loans to energy related businesses  we entered into commodity and interest rate swaps with the borrowers 
because of increases in natural gas prices and declines in interest rates  these swaps have increased in market value 
when we sold substantially all of the portfolio of loans  we retained these swaps 
as part of the sale agreement  we agreed that in the event these borrowers fail to meet their note obligations to the buyer of the portfolio  we could be required to share a portion of any proceeds we receive on these swaps with the buyer 
in  we paid million to the buyer of the portfolio out of million of swap proceeds collected 
as of december   we have collected million related to the remaining swaps  of which we have reserved million to cover this obligation 
the value of the unsettled portion of these swaps  which expire by december  was million at december  equity put rights certain minority owners of everest connections had the option to sell their ownership units to us if everest connections did not meet certain financial and operational performance measures as of december  target based put rights 
if the target based put rights were exercised  we would have been obligated to purchase up to million and million ownership units at a price of and per unit  respectively  for a total potential cost of million 
as a result of our reduced funding of this business  management assessed the likelihood of achieving these metrics and during recorded a probability weighted expense of million 
in  we achieved the operating targets related to million and million of ownership units at a price of and per unit  respectively 
therefore  we reversed million of this reserve 
we did not achieve the targets related to million of ownership units at a price of per unit 
the holders of these target based put rights exercised their options and were paid million for their ownership units in february as of december   we had fully reserved for this obligation 
the minority owners of million ownership units also have the option to sell their ownership units to us at fair market value market based put rights 
the market based put rights expire on december  we have not provided for this potential obligation as the exercise would represent an equity transaction at fair value 
we do not believe based on current estimates of fair value that these market based put rights are a material contingent obligation 
capital expenditures we estimate future cash requirements for capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment additions will be as follows actual estimated future cash requirements in millions domestic utilities canadian utilities everest connections corporate and other total capital expenditures our estimated domestic utilities capital expenditures increase significantly in from  primarily because of approximately million of additional capital expenditures on our south harper peaking facility and related transmission system upgrades 
in addition  and capital expenditures include the anticipated cost of additional emissions control equipment at our generating facilities 
iatan our power supply plan indicates the need for additional base load capacity after there is generally a five to seven year lead time required between the decision to proceed with a coal fired generating project and the completion of development  permitting  construction and performance testing of such a project 
kansas city power light company has presented their plan for the construction of up to mw of coal fired generating capacity at the existing iatan site in weston  missouri  through a series of workshops to the missouri public service commission mpsc and other interested parties 
the additional mw generating capacity is planned for commercial operation prior to summer on march   we filed an experimental regulatory plan with the mpsc outlining certain regulatory principles needed in order to facilitate our equity participation in mw of the proposed new iatan facility 
the table presented above does not include the additional capital expenditures that would be associated with this participation 
regulatory approvals required for financing we are required to obtain the prior approval of the ferc  kansas corporation commission and colorado public utilities commission prior to issuing long term debt or stock 
we currently have approval from the ferc  kansas commission and colorado commission to issue up to million of securities in the form of any combination of common stock and long term debt that is mandatorily convertible into our common stock 
we do not have approvals to incur additional long term debt 
we are also required to obtain the prior approval of the ferc to issue short term debt 
we have obtained their approval to have outstanding up to million of additional secured or unsecured short term debt 
we must obtain the prior approval of the kansas corporation commission to issue short term debt except as required to meet our working capital requirements 
the use of our utility assets as collateral generally requires the prior approval of the ferc and the regulatory commission in the state in which the utility assets are located 
restriction on ability to issue common stock our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to million shares of common stock  million shares of class a common stock and million shares of preferred stock 
of the million shares of common stock authorized to be issued  approximately million shares have either been issued or reserved for issuance in connection with the conversion of our pies or pursuant to employee compensation plans 
accordingly  unless our certificate of incorporation is amended with the approval of our shareholders  our ability to raise capital through the sale of common stock is severely restricted 
financial review this review of performance is organized by business segment  reflecting the way we managed our business during the periods covered by this report 
each business group leader is responsible for operating results down to earnings before interest and taxes ebit 
we use ebit as a performance measure as it captures the income and expenses within the management control of our segment business leaders 
because financing for the various business segments is generally completed at the parent company level  ebit provides our management and third parties an indication of how well individual business segments are performing 
therefore  each segment discussion focuses on the factors affecting ebit  while financing and income taxes are separately discussed at the corporate level 
the use of ebit as a performance measure is not meant to be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities  which are determined in accordance with gaap 
in addition  our use of ebit may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 
see page for cautionary statements and risk factors concerning forward looking statements contained in this analysis

cumulative effect of accounting change 
net loss key factors impacting continuing operating results our total loss before interest and taxes increased significantly in compared to key factors affecting results were as follows domestic utilities ebit decreased million primarily due to increased cost of natural gas used for fuel  higher purchased power cost and unfavorable weather for both the electric utility and the gas utility  partially offset by rate increases in nebraska  colorado and missouri 
the continued wind down of our energy trading businesses resulted in a million increase in losses before interest and taxes from merchant services  driven primarily by the losses associated with the termination of four long term gas contracts 
in corporate and other  we recorded million of foreign currency gains in related to favorable movements in the australian and new zealand dollar against the us dollar 
we recorded million of foreign currency gains in related to the wind down of our canadian merchant subsidiaries 
cumulative effect of accounting change in october  the eitf reached a consensus to rescind eitf no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
by rescinding eitf  all contracts that would have otherwise been accounted for under eitf and that do not fall within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  should no longer be marked to market through earnings 
we elected to adopt this requirement in october and thus reversed million or million on an after tax basis of earnings previously recognized 
restructuring charges as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded the following restructuring charges year ended december  in millions domestic utilities severance costs disposition of corporate aircraft total domestic utilities merchant services interest rate swap reductions severance costs

discontinued operations as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have reported the results of operations of the following assets in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income i our texas natural gas storage facility  our texas and mid continent natural gas pipeline systems  including our natural gas and natural gas liquids processing assets and our ownership interest in the oasis pipe line company  our west virginia coal terminal and our merchant loan portfolio that were all sold in and early  and ii our canadian network businesses that we sold in may and our consolidated independent power plants  lake cogen and onondaga  that we sold in march operating results of discontinued operations are as follows year ended december  in millions sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating expense net loss gain on sale of assets and other charges depreciation and amortization expense total operating expenses other income expense equity in earnings of investments other income expense total other income expense earnings loss before interest and taxes interest expense earnings loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit 
earnings loss from discontinued operations versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales and cost of sales decreased million and million  respectively  resulting in a gross profit decrease of million in compared to sales  cost of sales and gross profit for our canadian network business decreased million  million and million  respectively  primarily due to the sale of these businesses in may canadian utility sales  cost of sales and gross profit in june through december were million  million and million  respectively 
these decreases were partially offset by the march decision by the alberta energy utilities board aeub to reduce our and customer billing rates 
the aeub decision resulted in an adjustment that reduced our first quarter sales and gross profit by approximately million 
sales  cost of sales and gross profit for lake cogen and onondaga were lower in by million  million and million  respectively  due to the sale of these businesses in early march and a price dispute settlement that increased lake cogen s sales by million 
operating expense operating expense decreased million in compared to primarily due to the sale of our consolidated independent power plants in march and our canadian utility businesses in may net loss gain on sale of assets and other charges in  net gain on sale of assets and other charges of million consisted of a million gain related to the sale of our canadian utility businesses in may  and an million gain related to the sale of our consolidated independent power plants  lake cogen and onondaga  in march in  the million net loss and other charges was related to the impairment charge taken on our consolidated independent power plants 
in the third quarter of  we decided to proceed with their sale and therefore wrote them down to their estimated fair value less costs to sell  which was less than their carrying value 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in compared to the elimination of depreciation from our canadian utility businesses  due to their classification as held for sale in accordance with sfas  decreased depreciation expense million 
sfas requires that depreciation expense no longer be recorded for those assets classified for accounting purposes as held for sale 
the decrease was offset by the million adjustment in the first quarter of related to the decision by the aeub to reduce the depreciation rates on most of our distribution assets in alberta 
other income expense other income increased million in compared to  primarily due to costs including an million charge related to a currency put option purchased to protect us from unfavorable currency movements on the canadian asset sale proceeds and million of foreign currency losses related to us dollar denominated debt issued by our canadian subsidiaries 
income tax expense income tax expense increased million in compared to the income tax expense on pretax income from discontinued operations was primarily the result of taxes associated with the gain on the sale of our canadian utility businesses 
the effective tax rate on the pretax gain on sale of our canadian utility businesses is substantially higher than the statutory federal tax rate due to the following factors 
the us taxes reflect the partial deduction of canadian taxes  including withholding taxes  from the us taxable income instead of the full utilization of foreign tax credits 
taxes on the sale also reflect our inability to fully utilize the tax loss on the sale of the alberta business against the tax gain on the sale of the british columbia business 
offsetting the income tax expense was the reversal of million of valuation allowances provided in related to the impairment of our investments in independent power plants 
this valuation allowance was reversed in when the final sale structure was determined and an updated estimate of expected capital losses was completed 
in addition  our former alberta utility recognized income taxes using the flow through method 
as a result  the elimination of depreciation in and the adjustment of depreciable lives due to the regulatory decision increased pretax income but had no impact on income tax expense 
versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales and cost of sales decreased million and million  respectively  resulting in a gross profit decrease of million in compared to these decreases were primarily due to the sale of our gas gathering and pipeline assets and our coal terminal in the fourth quarter of and early in addition  sales and gross profit for our canadian network businesses decreased million and million  respectively  due to the decision by the aeub to decrease our and customer billing rates 
operating expense operating expense decreased million in compared to primarily due to the sale of our gas gathering and pipeline assets  merchant loan portfolio and coal terminal in and early net loss on sale of assets and other charges net loss on sale of assets and other charges consisted of million related to our consolidated independent power plants  lake cogen and onondaga 
in the third quarter of  we decided to proceed with the sale of these assets and therefore wrote them down to estimated fair value less costs to sell  which was less than their carrying value 
the net loss on sales of assets and other charges included a million loss on the sale of our gas gathering and pipeline assets  a million loss on the sale of our merchant loan portfolio  a million impairment of our coal terminal  a million pretax gain on sale of our gas storage assets  a million impairment charge on a canadian power plant and million of other impairment charges 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in compared to when we classified our canadian utility as held for sale  we stopped recording depreciation expense for that business 
this decreased depreciation expense by million 
approximately million of the decrease in depreciation and amortization was due to the sale of our gas gathering and pipeline assets and our coal terminal in the fourth quarter of and early the remaining decrease was primarily due to the aeub s decision to reduce the depreciation rates on most of our distribution assets in alberta 
equity in earnings of investments equity in earnings of investments decreased million due to the sale of our investment in the oasis pipe line company in the fourth quarter of other income other income decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the sale of our merchant loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of this business generated million of other income in in  we incurred an million charge related to a currency put option purchased to protect us from unfavorable currency movements on the canadian asset sale proceeds and million of foreign currency losses related to us dollar denominated debt issued by our canadian subsidiaries 
income tax benefit income tax benefit decreased million primarily due to pretax income in compared to a pretax loss in and the aeub decision discussed above 
this decision decreased sales and depreciation  however  only the sales impact is tax effected for canadian regulatory purposes 
in  million of our losses were treated as capital losses for income tax purposes 
because capital losses can only offset capital gains  and we do not have sufficient capital gains in prior years to offset all of these losses  nor can we be assured of generating future capital gains  we recorded a million valuation allowance against our capital loss carryforward 
in addition  the impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets included the effects of million of goodwill and other intangibles that were not deductible for income tax purposes 
these benefits were offset by income tax expense that was recorded for our canadian operations 
due to our decision to sell this business  we could no longer represent that cash from this business would be permanently reinvested 
therefore  additional deferred tax was recorded to account for taxes associated with bringing asset sales proceeds back to the united states 
in addition  approximately million of the impairment charge on our consolidated independent power plants was expected to be a capital loss for which we provided additional valuation allowances 
three year review domestic utilities domestic utilities is made up of our electric and gas regulated utility businesses  which operate as aquila in colorado  iowa  kansas  michigan  minnesota  missouri and nebraska

sales and gross profit increased by million due to rate increases in colorado effective in july and in missouri effective in april  plus million of additional margin from an increase in customers 
these were partially offset by a million increase in cost of sales due to the higher cost of fuel and purchased power  net of offsetting derivative hedge positions in and unfavorable weather also decreased gross profit by million 
in addition  electric cost of sales included million of favorable adjustments resulting from the settlement of purchased power pricing disputes that did not recur in sales and cost of sales for our regulated gas utilities increased million and million  respectively  in compared to  for a net decrease in gross profit of million 
sales and cost of sales increased due to an increase in natural gas prices 
however  because gas purchase costs for our gas utility operations are passed through to our customers  the change in gas prices did not have a corresponding impact on gross profit 
regulated gas margins decreased million due to unfavorable weather and lower usage per customer in compared to regulated gas margins in included a million favorable change in reserved funds released upon conclusion of multi year gas cost recovery filings that did not recur in the overall decline in gas margins due to volume and weather was partially offset by million in rate increases in nebraska and missouri and million of increased margins from customer growth 
non regulated gas sales  cost of sales and gross profit decreased million  million and 
million  respectively  in compared to  primarily as the result of the sale of certain non regulated gas pipeline and gathering operations in august non regulated other sales decreased million and cost of sales increased 
million for a net decrease in gross profit of million  primarily as a result of a decrease in appliance service contracts and increased costs of servicing existing contracts 
operating expense operating expense increased million in compared to  as a result of a number of cost increases 
the most significant of these was outside services and materials costs  which increased million  and labor and other compensation costs  which increased million due to additional customer service representatives  apprentice linemen  increased pension costs and compliance costs in compared to depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the adjustments to depreciation rates resulting from recent rate cases 
versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales and cost of sales for the domestic utilities businesses decreased million and million  respectively  resulting in a gross profit increase of million in compared to these changes were primarily due to the following factors regulated electric utility sales and cost of sales increased million and million  respectively  in compared to  for a net increase in gross profit of million 
sales and gross profit increased by million due to a rate increase in colorado effective in july and million of additional margin from favorable weather and customer growth 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in margin from off system sales and a million increase in cost of sales due to the higher cost of natural gas used to fuel our power plants  net of offsetting derivative positions 
sales and cost of sales for our regulated gas utilities increased million and million  respectively  in compared to  for a net increase in gross profit of million 
sales and cost of sales increased due to a increase in natural gas prices 
however  because gas purchase costs for our gas utility operations are passed through to our customers  the change in gas prices did not have a corresponding impact on gross profit 
gross profit for our regulated gas utilities increased primarily due to million in rate increases in michigan  iowa and nebraska  a million change in reserved funds released upon conclusion of multi year gas cost recovery filings in various states and customer growth of million 
non regulated gas sales  cost of sales and gross profit decreased million  million and million  respectively  in compared to  primarily as the result of the sale of our non regulated retail gas operations on september  other non regulated gross profit was lower by million in  primarily due to the sale of our off system appliance repair business in january operating expense operating expense decreased million in compared to  primarily due to approximately million of lower labor  benefits and administrative expenses resulting from the restructuring of our domestic utility operations 
restructuring charges restructuring charges decreased million in compared to as a result of the restructuring of our domestic utilities business to more closely align it with our state service areas  we incurred million in restructuring costs in  primarily in the form of severance for terminated employees and the disposition of our corporate aircraft operation 
net gain loss on sale of assets and other charges as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  domestic utilities incurred a million asset impairment charge related to a local natural gas distribution system deemed unrecoverable in one of our regulatory jurisdictions in  compared to a net million gain in on several minor asset dispositions and impairments 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to  primarily due to the adjustment of depreciation rates in one jurisdiction in december earnings trend the recent settlement of our electric and gas rate cases in missouri is expected to increase annual sales approximately million and million  respectively 
however  our costs of natural gas used for fuel and purchased power have exceeded the level of costs recovered under the iec discussed on page if these costs remain above the iec base cost for the two year period  we will not recover the excess 
a portion of the rate increase is to cover increased costs in the month test period such as additional staffing to improve customer service 
to the extent that operating costs increase or decrease subsequent to the test period  the impact of the change will affect our operating results 
our power supply agreement with aries  which provides up to mw of power  expires in june we plan to replace this power with the construction of the south harper peaking facility  a megawatt combustion turbine generation plant near peculiar  missouri  and by entering into power purchase agreements 
the construction of south harper is expected to require additional capital expenditures of approximately million 
in addition  transmission system upgrades of million will be required 
to the extent the cost of this replacement power exceeds the cost of power recovered in rates under the aries agreement  and until such cost is recovered in a subsequent rate case  our earnings could be adversely affected 
on december   one of our coal suppliers declared a partial force majeure event due to a labor strike at the mine and gave us formal notice they would be unable to fully perform their contract obligations for the then following to days 
this force majeure condition continued throughout with aquila receiving approximately of its contracted low sulfur  high btu volumes 
although force majeure conditions are expected to improve in  we continue to plan for and have secured substantial quantities of alternate supply through spot purchases  despite a general decrease in availability of comparable coal on the spot market 
these substitute supplies of coal are typically of higher sulfur content and therefore require the purchase of additional so emission allowances at a time when the cost of such allowances is substantially higher than historical levels 
in the event we continue to replace our original contracted coal supply with the substitute coal supply during  our operating results could be adversely affected 
merchant services we conduct our merchant services business through aquila merchant services  inc aquila merchant  which primarily owns  operates and contractually controls our non regulated power generation assets

to the extent losses exceeded gains  sales are shown as a negative number 
versus sales  cost of sales and gross loss gross loss for our merchant services operations for was million  primarily due to the following factors approximately million was a non cash loss related to the discounting of our trading portfolio  primarily driven by our long term gas contracts 
after updating the future cash flow stream based on the new forward natural gas prices  we discount the future cash flows of our price risk management assets based on our counterparties credit standing  versus our future cash flows of our price risk management liabilities that are discounted based on our current credit standing 
in prior periods  primarily in  when our credit standing deteriorated compared to our counterparties that make up the vast majority of our price risk management assets  we recorded non cash earnings related to the discounting of our price risk management assets and liabilities 
during  the benchmark indices we use to determine the discount rate appropriate for our credit standing decreased  resulting in the partial reversal of the previous earnings and assets recorded 
due to the settlement of four of our long term gas contracts  the future impact of non cash mark to market movements described above will be significantly reduced 
in  we incurred margin losses of million resulting from the difference between revenue recognized on our long term gas contracts and the net cost of gas delivered under these contracts 
during  we made fixed capacity payments evenly throughout the year that entitled us to generate power at merchant power plants owned by others 
for  we recorded net margin loss associated with these agreements of million 
the cost to purchase natural gas to fuel these power plants generally exceeded the value of the power that could be generated 
accordingly  we did not generate material revenues 
capacity payments were lower in compared to because we terminated our acadia capacity contract in the second quarter of and our aries capacity contract in the first quarter of the settlement of our price risk management assets and liabilities associated with four of our long term gas contracts resulted in non cash  mark to market losses of approximately million related to the discounting of our trading portfolio 
we discount the future cash flows of our price risk management assets based on our counterparties credit standing  versus our future cash flows of our price risk management liabilities that are discounted based on our current credit standing 
this resulted in the recording of a net asset related to these four long term contracts and their corresponding commodity hedges of approximately million prior to our settlement 
additionally  we recorded a margin loss of approximately million for margin recorded on these long term contracts and approximately million related to replacement gas payments we made under the termination provisions of these contracts 
we incurred approximately million of costs to manage our remaining natural gas hedge positions related to the onondaga swap derivative sold in connection with the sale of our independent power plants  cash flow hedge option premium expirations  the exit of other hedges related to previous contracts and settlements of various open positions during our remaining gross loss for mainly stems from mark to market losses and unfavorable settlements of approximately million  related to a long term power supply transaction with nyseg and our remaining stream flow transaction which expires in in may  we settled our obligation under the long term power supply contract with nyseg by making a cash payment of million to a third party that assumed our obligations under this contract 
gross loss for our merchant services operations for was million  primarily due to the following factors partially offsetting the losses discussed below were approximately million of non cash earnings related to the discounting of our trading portfolios  primarily driven by long term gas contracts 
during  average gas prices rose over the life of our price risk management assets and liabilities by 
per mmbtu 
in  we incurred margin losses of million  resulting from the difference between revenue recognized on our long term gas contracts and the net cost of gas delivered under these contracts 
during  we made fixed capacity payments evenly throughout the year that entitled us to generate power at merchant power plants owned by others 
for  we recorded net margin loss associated with these agreements of million 
the cost to purchase natural gas to fuel these power plants generally exceeded the value of the power that could be generated 
accordingly  we did not generate material revenues 
in  we incurred approximately million of unfavorable settlements of our highly structured stream flow and long term power supply transactions and our continued wind down of our european trading operations 
we recorded a million non cash loss related to the sale of our capacity under certain long term gas transportation agreements at substantially less than our future commitments 
although the loss was recognized for accounting purposes  the cash associated with the loss will be paid out over the term of the contracts 
we recognized approximately million of net mark to market losses on natural gas hedge positions related to the onondaga swap derivative and other hedges related to previous contracts 
the remaining million of gross loss primarily relates to mark to market losses on alternative risk contracts and settlements of various open positions during operating expense operating expense decreased million primarily due to million of expense accrued in related to our january settlement with the cftc  and lower labor and other costs related to continued reductions in staff as part of the wind down of our merchant operations 
restructuring charges restructuring charges decreased million in compared to this decrease stemmed primarily from restructuring charges of million during relating to the termination of our remaining interest rate swaps associated with the construction financings for our clay county and piatt county power plants 
as debt related to these facilities was retired earlier than anticipated  our swaps exceeded our outstanding debt 
as a result  we reduced our swap position and realized the loss associated with the cancelled portion of the swaps 
net loss on sale of assets and other charges during  net loss on sale of assets and other charges consisted of a million loss on the termination of four long term gas contracts  a million loss on the transfer of our equity interest in the aries power project and termination of our tolling obligation and an million impairment charge on our investment in the red lake gas storage project  offset by a million gain related to the sale of our equity method investments in independent power plants  a million gain on the sale of our marchwood development project in the united kingdom  a million gain related to a distribution from baf energy and a million reduction of our reserve for the anticipated settlement of our outstanding liabilities to enron 
during  we recorded million of net loss on sale of assets and other charges 
these charges consisted of million related to the write down of our equity method investments in independent power plants 
in the third quarter of  we decided to sell our interest in these plants and therefore wrote our investments down to estimated fair value  which was less than their carrying value 
also included was a million payment for the termination of our year tolling contract for the acadia power plant  partially offset by a million gain related to the contract termination and sale of certain turbines that we had previously written down to estimated fair value 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the elimination of the amortization of premiums associated with our equity method investments in independent power plants  resulting from the impairment of our investments in these plants in september equity in earnings of investments equity in earnings of investments decreased million due to the sale of our independent power plant investments in the first quarter of other income expense other income decreased million in primarily due to two items recorded in that did not recur in on january   the eighth circuit court of appeals overturned a prior adverse decision of the united states tax court regarding the proper depreciable life of certain of our natural gas gathering and pipeline assets 
as a result of the appeals court s decision  we reversed the accrual of million of interest expense in that would have been payable had the internal revenue service prevailed in the dispute 
we also realized foreign currency translation gains of million on the wind down of our european merchant operations in versus sales  cost of sales and gross loss the significant factors causing the gross loss of million in are discussed above 
gross loss for our merchant services operations for was million 
the following describes the major components of the gross loss approximately million of this loss related to balancing counterparty positions  reducing open positions and terminating existing contracts as a result of our decision to exit the wholesale energy trading business 
in  we incurred margin losses of million  resulting from the difference between revenue recognized on our long term gas contracts and the net cost of gas delivered under these contracts 
we made fixed capacity payments evenly throughout that entitled us to generate power at merchant power plants owned by others 
for  we recorded net margin loss associated with these agreements of million 
we recognized approximately million of net mark to market losses on natural gas hedge positions related to the onondaga swap derivative and other hedges related to previous contracts 
partially offsetting the losses discussed above were approximately million of non cash earnings related to the discounting of our trading portfolios  primarily driven by long term gas contracts 
also offsetting the losses described above was gross profit of million from the optimization of the energy trading portfolio prior to the june  announcement of our exit from wholesale energy trading 
operating expense operating expense decreased million primarily due to labor and benefit savings  lower corporate costs resulting from the restructuring of this business in and related operating cost reductions resulting from the exit from our wholesale energy trading operations in  partially offset by million of expense accrued in related to our january settlement with the cftc and a million write down of our remaining merchant note receivable in restructuring charges restructuring charges decreased million in compared to this decrease stemmed primarily from significant charges taken in in connection with the exit from our wholesale energy trading business in  we incurred million of restructuring charges 
these charges included million of severance and retention payments to terminated employees  million of leasehold improvements and equipment that were expensed when we vacated the related leased properties  million of lease costs connected to future lease commitments  million of losses associated with the exit from our retail aggregator loan business and million of other charges 
partially offsetting the decrease were restructuring charges of million and million during and  respectively  relating to the termination of our remaining interest rate swaps associated with the construction financings for our clay county and piatt county power plants 
as debt related to these facilities was retired earlier than anticipated  the notional amount of our swaps exceeded our outstanding debt 
we therefore reduced our position and realized the loss associated with the cancelled portion of the swaps 
net loss on sale of assets and other charges during  we recorded million of net loss on sale of assets and other charges 
these charges consisted of million related to the write down of our equity method investments in independent power plants 
in the third quarter of  we decided to sell our interest in these plants and therefore wrote our investments down to estimated fair value  which was less than their carrying value 
impairment charges also includes a million payment for the termination of our year tolling contract for the acadia power plant  partially offset by a million gain related to the contract termination and sale of certain turbines that we had previously written down to estimated fair value 
for  net loss on sale of assets and other charges consisted primarily of an impairment charge of million related to goodwill associated with merchant services that became unrealizable due to our exit from this business  million relating to the expected loss associated with either the sale or contract termination of four electric turbines that were sold or returned to the manufacturer in  million related to our exit from the lodi gas storage investment  million related to fees and expenses associated with the termination of our proposed cogentrix acquisition  and million of other impairments 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to approximately million of this increase was due to a decrease in the estimated amortizable life of certain plant premiums relating to our acquisition of gpu international in december in addition  the start of commercial operations at three owned power plants contributed an additional million of depreciation and amortization expense in these increases were partially offset by decreased depreciation related to excess leasehold improvements and equipment that were expensed when we vacated the related leased properties 
other income expense other income increased million in primarily due to two items 
on january   the eighth circuit court of appeals overturned a prior adverse decision of the united states tax court regarding the proper depreciable life of certain of our natural gas gathering and pipeline assets 
as a result of the appeals court s decision  we reversed the accrual of million of interest expense in that would have been payable had the internal revenue service prevailed in the dispute 
we also realized foreign currency translation gains of million on the wind down of our european merchant operations 
current operating developments ice sale in february  we sold our interest in intercontinentalexchange  inc ice  which owns a web based commodity exchange platform  to other shareholders in ice for approximately million 
this transaction resulted in a pretax gain of approximately million 
batesville tolling contract in february  we terminated our power sales contract and assigned our rights and obligations under the toll contract in exchange for approximately million 
this transaction resulted in a pretax gain of approximately million 
earnings trend and impact of changing business environment the merchant energy sector has been negatively impacted by the increase in generation capacity that became operational in and this increase in supply has placed downward pressure on power prices and subsequently the value of unsold merchant generation capacity 
because it is generally expected that the fuel and start up costs of operating our merchant power plants will exceed the revenues that would be generated from the power sold  we believe that during the foreseeable future we will have limited ability to generate power at a gross profit 
we will continue to have operating and maintenance cost associated with our owned merchant generation plants  whether the facilities are being utilized to generate power or are idle 
additionally  we will be required to make capacity payments related to our tolling agreements with elwood and expect to incur pretax losses and negative operating cash flows of approximately million in related to this arrangement 
we are attempting to terminate or restructure this obligation 
we have sold capacity in three of these plants which will partially offset these costs in and as a result of the above factors and our change in strategy  we do not expect merchant services to be profitable in the next two to three years 
we attempt to optimize and hedge our power plants with forward contracts which qualify as derivative instruments 
when we enter into these positions  we account for them at fair market value under mark to market accounting 
the hedges are an offset to our power plants  which use accrual accounting 
because different accounting rules are used on each side of the transaction  this can cause significant fluctuations in earnings with limited impacts on cash flow 
we began winding down and terminating our trading positions with our various counterparties during the third quarter of however  it will take a number of years to complete the wind down 
because most of our trading positions are hedged  we should experience limited fluctuation in earnings or losses other than the impacts from counterparty credit  the discounting or accretion of interest  or the termination or liquidation of additional trading contracts 
we have one remaining highly customized actuarial based contract in merchant services which expires in there may be earnings volatility associated with this contract due to its highly customized nature and our inability to completely hedge the associated risk 
using a long term value at risk methodology  with a confidence level  we estimate million of total volatility potential earnings or losses related to this contract

these decreases were partially offset by an million increase in costs associated with the settlement of the appraisal rights shareholder lawsuit in and million of additional costs related to the exit of our international networks investment in restructuring charges restructuring charges decreased million in compared to this was primarily due to million of severance and other related costs that were paid in in connection with the restructuring of everest connections  and 
million of executive severance that was paid in net loss gain on sale of assets and other charges the net loss on sale of assets and other charges of million is mainly due to the million impairment on three natural gas combustion turbines that were held for future construction by one of our non regulated subsidiaries and have now been transferred to our missouri electric operations at their current fair value 
the impairment was partially offset by the reversal of our everest connections target based put rights liability of million due to the meeting of certain financial and operational performance measures  and the million gain we recorded in connection with the sale of our interest in midlands electricity in january the midlands electricity investment was written down to its estimated fair value in and again in september however  due to strengthening of the british pound exchange rate in the fourth quarter of and in early  we realized a gain on the closing of the sale

the impairments also included of million of impairment losses related to our investment in quanta services and million of impairment losses related to everest connections and other communication technology investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further explanation 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased million primarily due to the reduced depreciable asset base at everest connections resulting from the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of equity in earnings of investments equity in earnings of investments decreased million in compared to this decrease was primarily due to the sale of our interest in unitednetworks limited in new zealand in october  which contributed equity earnings of million in  the sale of our australian investments which contributed million of equity earnings in compared to million in  and not recording equity earnings in from our midlands investment due to regulatory limitations on cash payments by midlands to its owners 
in  we received no cash dividends or management fees from midlands  which would have enabled us to recognize earnings on this investment 
our share of undistributed net earnings from midlands was million in during  we recorded equity earnings of million related to our midlands investment 
gain on sale of subsidiary stock in october  we sold our shares in our new zealand utility business in a public tender offer and realized a gain of million 
minority interest in loss of subsidiaries minority interest in loss of subsidiaries decreased million in compared to due to the reduction of everest connections minority capital balances to zero in october in accordance with everest connections limited liability company agreement  losses were allocated first to the membership units held by minority owners until their capital accounts were depleted 
after all minority accounts were reduced to zero  losses were allocated to us 
as a result  we recorded all of everest connections losses in other income expense other income increased million  mainly due to million of foreign currency gains in resulting from favorable movements in the australian and new zealand dollar against the us dollar 
in addition  included million of foreign exchange and interest rate hedge losses relating to our original planned financing structure that was not consummated in connection with our midlands acquisition  and more than million of losses related to technology related fund investments 
this increase was also due to million of foreign currency gains recognized in the second quarter of due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar on us dollar obligations of a former canadian finance subsidiary not included in discontinued operations 
interest expense and income tax benefit the table below summarizes our consolidated interest expense and income tax benefit year ended december  in millions interest expense income tax benefit versus interest expense interest expense decreased million in compared to the decrease was primarily the result of the following lower interest costs of million related to the retirement of debt associated with our international utility investments and power generation  decreased interest expense and fees on short term borrowings and letter of credit facilities of approximately million  and decreased amortization of debt issue costs of million mainly associated with the day secured credit facility and the three year secured term loan in these decreases were partially offset by the following increase in interest expense the repayment in the third quarter of of million under our three year secured term loan resulted in the expensing of million of unamortized debt issue costs 
income tax benefit the income tax benefit increased million in compared to  primarily due to increased pretax losses  the decrease in net valuation allowances provided on capital losses and the accrual of non deductible fines and penalties in versus interest expense interest expense increased million in compared to the increase was primarily the result the following higher interest costs of million related to the million of senior notes issued in july  the borrowing in the second quarter of of million under our three year secured term loan that resulted in million of additional interest expense  and amortization of debt issue costs of million mainly associated with the day secured credit facility and the three year secured term loan 
these increases were offset in part by the retirement of our prior revolving credit facility  debt outstanding in australia  new zealand and the united kingdom in late and early  and the conversion of the premium equity participating securities to common equity in november income tax benefit the income tax benefit decreased million in compared to  primarily as a result of lower losses before income taxes in compared to  and due to the removal of our permanent investment elections in australia and canada in also impacting income tax benefits were a valuation allowance on anticipated capital losses associated with the sale of our equity method independent power plants  a valuation allowance on certain state tax loss carryforwards and a non deductible fine 
tax benefits were not recognized on a significant amount of the losses as a result of valuation allowances provided on capital losses and certain non deductible expenses 
other items critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these statements include some amounts that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties that affect the application of such policies 
as discussed below  while we believe these financial statements include the most likely outcomes with regard to amounts that are based on our judgments and estimates  our financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
our critical accounting policies include energy trading and derivative accounting the portion of our trading activities that qualify as derivatives under sfas is recorded under the mark to market method of accounting 
the market prices or fair values used in determining the value of our portfolio are our best estimates utilizing information such as closing exchange rates  over the counter quotes  historical volatility and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating our positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable amount of time under current market conditions 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
as a result  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates 
operating results can also be affected by changes in underlying factors used in the determination of fair value of our portfolio such as the following we have variability in our mark to market earnings due to changes in the market price for gas and or power 
our portfolio is valued from current and expected future gas and power prices 
changes in these prices can cause fluctuations in our earnings 
we discount our price risk management assets and liabilities using risk free interest rates adjusted for our credit standing and the credit standings of our counterparties in accordance with sfas which is more fully described in statement of financial accounting concepts no 
 using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurement 
because our price risk management liabilities are discounted using our credit standing  versus the receivable side of these transactions which are discounted based on our counterparties credit standings which on average are higher than ours  non cash mark to market earnings or losses are created 
as these spreads narrow  we record mark to market losses  as they widen  we record mark to market gains 
these gains and losses can fluctuate if our credit or the credit of a group of our counterparties deteriorates or improves significantly 
we also have other activities in our utility operations that are accounted for under sfas the majority of these activities consist of the purchasing of gas  power and coal for our utility operations  which fall under the normal purchases and sales exception 
these activities require that management make certain judgments regarding the election of the normal purchases and sales exceptions 
unbilled utility revenues sales related to the delivery of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of sales is based on reading customers meters  which occurs systematically throughout the month 
at the end of each month  an estimate is made of the amount of energy delivered to customers after the date of the last meter reading 
the unbilled revenue is calculated each month based on estimated customer usage  weather factors  line losses and applicable customer rates 
total unbilled revenues at december  were million 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
unforeseen events and changes in conditions could indicate that these carrying values may not be recoverable and may therefore result in impairment charges 
an impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds its future undiscounted cash flows 
once deemed impaired  the long lived asset is written down to its fair value 
the determination of future cash flows  and  if required  fair value of a long lived asset is by its nature a highly subjective judgment 
fair value is determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital  third party contracted bids or appraisals performed by a qualified party 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the long term estimated cash flows  including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of our long lived assets 
during  we evaluated the carrying value of three power peaking plants we own 
as of december   the carrying value of these plants was million 
we performed this evaluation due to reduced spark spreads and an oversupply of generation that we expect will continue for the foreseeable future 
this situation has prevented these plants from firing and  in turn  has created losses for us 
it is forecasted that these losses will continue for the next few years 
we separately tested the cash flows for each plant based on estimated margin contributions and forecasted operating expenses over their remaining plant lives 
these peaking plants were placed into service in and and we depreciate these facilities over years 
in evaluating future estimated margin contributions  we used external price curves based on four different future price environments 
in each environment  we calculated an average margin contribution based on a multi simulation scenario analysis and then equally weighted each price environment 
based on this analysis and the level of probability we would sell these assets  the undiscounted probability weighted cash flows for these plants exceeded their current book value 
therefore  under sfas no impairment was required as of december  we have evaluated these assets as held and used 
if at some future date we determine these assets are held for sale  based on current market values  we would likely record a material impairment charge 
goodwill and other intangible assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas we no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test it for impairment each year on november  and if impaired  write it off against earnings at that time 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit  determined on a discounted cash flow basis or other fair market value methods  with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied goodwill excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value assigned to its assets and liabilities with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to determining the fair value of goodwill  and thus any impairment  is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires us to make cash flow assumptions about future sales  operating costs and discount rates over an indefinite life  and the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material 
management s assumptions about future sales margins and volumes require significant judgment because actual margins and volumes have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so 
in estimating future margins and expenses  we use our internal budgets 
we develop our budgets based on anticipated customer growth  rate cases  inflation and weather trends 
total goodwill at december  was million 
regulatory accounting implications we currently record the economic effects of regulation in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
accordingly  our balance sheet reflects certain costs as regulatory assets 
we are required to periodically assess the probable recovery of our regulatory assets 
we expect our rates will continue to be based on historical costs for the foreseeable future 
however  if we no longer qualified for treatment under sfas  we would make adjustments to the carrying value of our regulatory assets and liabilities and would be required to recognize them in current period earnings 
total regulatory assets and liabilities at december  were million and million  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
valuation of deferred tax assets we are required to assess the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets generated from net operating losses and capital losses incurred on the sale of assets using a more likely than not assessment of realization 
this assessment takes into consideration tax planning strategies within our control  including assumptions regarding the availability and character of future taxable income 
as of december   we have recorded million of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of the tax asset is mainly dependent on the availability of future capital gains and taxable income in certain states 
the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be materially different from that recorded  as impacted by changes in federal income tax laws and upon the generation of future capital gains or state taxable income to enable us to realize the related tax assets 
as of december   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards originating in and million of estimated federal net operating losses originating in the federal net operating loss carryforward expires in and can be carried back to to offset potential irs audit adjustments 
the federal net operating loss carryforward expires in and cannot be carried back due to losses in the carryback years 
we did not record valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets related to federal net operating losses 
this determination was based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that we will realize these deferred assets during the carryforward period 
this assessment considered the forecasted reversal of existing temporary differences and taxable income expected to be generated in the carryforward period and potential irs audit adjustments in pension plans our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits described in note to the consolidated financial statements are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension costs  for example  are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods  the level of contributions we make to the plan and earnings on plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of the plan may also impact current and future pension costs 
pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension costs 
as of september   our average assumed discount rate was and our average expected return on plan assets was 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage 
while the chart below reflects an increase in the percentage for each assumption  we and our actuaries expect that the inverse of this change would impact the projected benefit obligation pbo at december   and our estimated annual pension cost apc on the income statement for by a similar amount in the opposite direction

significant balance sheet movements total assets decreased by  million since december  this decrease is primarily due to the following cash decreased million 
see our consolidated statement of cash flows for analysis of this decrease 
restricted cash decreased million  primarily due to the release of cash that had been previously restricted for a large counterparty s customer funds on deposit of million  partially offset by million of additional cash we restricted for the resolution of a dispute over the early retirement of the million three year secured term loan 
funds on deposit decreased million  primarily due to the return of margin deposits paid to counterparties in connection with the continued wind down of our wholesale energy trading portfolio  offset in part by additional requirements by our suppliers of natural gas that we post additional margin deposits as a result of our non investment grade credit rating 
accounts receivable decreased million  primarily due to lower volumes of natural gas and electricity delivered due to the continued wind down of wholesale energy trading business  offset in part by increased natural gas prices since december  price risk management assets decreased million  primarily due to the termination of four long term gas contracts and related hedges in and a reduction in the number of wholesale energy trading contracts  partially offset by an increase in natural gas prices since december  investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased by million  primarily due to the sale of our investment in midlands electricity and our equity method investments in independent power plants 
deferred charges decreased by million  primarily due to the elimination of deferred income tax regulatory assets in connection with the sale of our canadian utility businesses 
current and non current assets of discontinued operations decreased  million  primarily due to the sale of our canadian utility businesses and our consolidated independent power plants 
total liabilities decreased by  million and common shareholders equity decreased by million since december  these changes are primarily attributable to the following accounts payable decreased by million  primarily due to lower volumes of natural gas and electricity delivered due to the continued wind down of our wholesale energy trading business  offset in part by increased natural gas prices since december  other accrued liabilities decreased by million  primarily due to the settlement with the cftc regarding the reporting of our natural gas trading information to publications that compile and report index prices and the settlement of our appraisal rights litigation 
price risk management liabilities decreased million  primarily due to the termination of four long term gas contracts and related hedges in  and a reduction in the number of trading contracts  partially offset by an increase in natural gas prices since december  customer funds on deposit decreased million  primarily due to the return of a large counterparty s deposit after the underlying contracts associated with the counterparty were settled in short term and long term debt  including current maturities of long term debt  together decreased by million  primarily due to the retirement of the three year secured term loan  the repayment of the and series of senior notes  and the early retirement of the midlands acquisition note payable 
these decreases were partially offset by the issuance of the pies and five year million unsecured term loan 
deferred income taxes and credits decreased million  primarily due to deferred tax benefits on net operating losses  and the sale of our investments in midlands electricity and canadian utility businesses 
long term gas contracts  including the current portion of long term gas contracts  decreased million  primarily due to the termination of our obligations under four long term gas contracts in deferred credits decreased million  primarily due to the elimination of deferred income tax regulatory liabilities in connection with the sale of our canadian utility businesses 
current and non current liabilities of discontinued operations decreased by million  primarily due to the sale of our canadian utility businesses and our consolidated independent power plants 
common shareholders equity decreased million  primarily as a result of the million net loss in and other comprehensive income losses due to the sale of our investments in midlands electricity and canadian utility businesses offset in part by the issuance of million shares of common stock for approximately million

forward looking information and risk factors this report contains forward looking information 
forward looking information involves risks and uncertainties  and certain important factors can cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
the forward looking statements contained in this report include we expect to complete construction of a megawatt  natural gas fired generation facility near peculiar  missouri this summer 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include the construction of our south harper peaking facility could be delayed by weather 
the construction of our south harper peaking facility could be delayed or barred by an adverse outcome of litigation pending against us 
we expect our utility rates to be increased in certain states where we have utility operations 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include regulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request 
the timing of utility rate increases approved by regulatory commissions is often beyond our control and  until final approval is received  our earnings will continue to be impacted 
we anticipate significant additional capital expenditures in order to satisfy our long term power generation and transmission needs and comply with environmental rules and regulations 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include we may not receive the approvals required to participate in the planned construction of additional generating capacity at the iatan facility near weston  missouri  or to complete the south harper peaking facility 
environmental rules and regulations could change such that we are not required to make anticipated capital expenditures for environmental compliance 
we may not receive shareholder approval to issue additional shares of our common stock  which may be required to fund part of our anticipated future capital expenditures 
we believe that the anticipated capital costs of environmental compliance will be allowed for recovery in future rate cases 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include regulatory commissions may refuse to allow us to recover in rates part or all of the capital costs related to environmental compliance 
changes in applicable law or regulation may prohibit us from recovering in rates part or all of the capital costs related to environmental compliance 
we intend to execute our long term strategic plan  including the sale of certain regulated utility assets and our interests in three merchant peaking facilities and everest connections  as well as the termination of the elwood tolling contract  which we expect to help bring our returns closer to those of our peers by the end of some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include we may receive bids for assets at prices that are inadequate or insufficient for accomplishing our targeted goals 
regulatory commissions may not approve some or all of the contemplated divestitures 
we may not be able to retire indebtedness and our other long term obligations on reasonable terms with the proceeds raised by additional asset sales 
we may not be able to improve returns on our domestic utilities business if our business process improvement initiative does not create significant savings over the next three years or  even if it does generate significant savings  we may not be allowed by regulatory commissions to retain such savings for the benefit of our shareholders 
the counterparty to the elwood tolling contract may be unwilling to terminate or restructure this contract  or we may not find a third party willing to assume this obligation upon acceptable terms 
we anticipate that our current revolving credit capacity and available cash will be sufficient to fund our winter needs and working capital requirements 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include our access to revolving credit capacity depends on maintaining compliance with loan covenants 
if we violate these covenants  we may lose revolving credit capacity and not have sufficient cash available for our winter needs 
unanticipated increases in the price of natural gas that we purchase for our utility customers could exhaust our liquidity in the winter months 
counterparties may default on their obligations to supply commodities or return collateral to us or to meet their obligations under commercial contracts  including those designed to hedge against movements in commodity prices 
we will attempt to improve operating cash flows by improving our operating efficiencies  increasing utility rates and cost recovery  retiring debt and long term liabilities  and completing the wind down of our merchant services business 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include we may not recover a significant portion of the fuel and purchase power costs we incur to provide utility services in our largest jurisdiction  missouri 
we may not be able to improve returns on our domestic utilities business if our business process improvement initiative does not create significant savings over the next three years or  even if it does generate significant savings  we may not be allowed by regulatory commissions to retain such savings for the benefit of our shareholders 
counterparties may default on their obligations to supply commodities or return collateral to us or to meet their obligations under commercial contracts  including those designed to hedge against movements in commodity prices 
the counterparty to the elwood tolling contract may be unwilling to terminate or restructure this contract  or we may not find a third party willing to assume this obligation upon acceptable terms 
we believe that we have strong defenses to litigation pending against us 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include judges and juries can be difficult to predict and may  in fact  rule against us 
our positions may be weakened by adverse developments in the law or the discovery of facts that hurt our cases 
we do not expect that the annual limitations on net operating losses would cause any of our net operating losses to expire unutilized for purposes of reducing our taxes 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include changes in the tax law could result in our tax net operating losses going unutilized 
the failure to generate sufficient income could result in our tax net operating losses going unutilized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk utility operations our domestic regulated businesses produce  purchase and distribute power in three states and purchase and distribute natural gas in seven states 
all of our gas distribution utilities have pga provisions that allow them to pass the prudently incurred cost of gas through to the customer 
to the extent that gas prices are higher or lower than amounts in our current billing rates  adjustments are made on a periodic basis to true up billed amounts to match the actual cost we incurred 
these adjustments are subject to periodic prudence reviews by the state utility commissions 
in our regulated electric business in  we generated approximately of the power that we sold and we purchased the remaining through long term contracts or in the open market 
the regulatory provisions for recovering power costs vary by state 
in kansas and colorado  we have an energy cost adjustment and an incentive clause adjustment  respectively  that serve a purpose similar to the pgas for our gas utilities 
to the extent that our fuel and purchased power energy costs vary from the energy cost built into our tariffs  the difference is passed through to the customer 
in missouri  we do not have the ability to adjust the rates we charge for electric service to offset all or part of any increase or decrease in prices we pay for natural gas  coal or other fuel we use in generating electricity ie  a fuel adjustment mechanism 
as a result  our exposure to commodity price changes is concentrated in the missouri electric operations resulting in greater earnings volatility from year to year there than in our other electric rate jurisdictions 
we have taken several measures to mitigate the commodity price risk exposure in our missouri electric operations 
one of these measures is contracting for a diverse supply of coal to meet of our native load fuel requirements of coal fired generation in and in through  respectively 
we are currently receiving reduced volumes on one of these coal contracts because of a declared partial force majeure that occurred in the price risk associated with our natural gas and on peak spot market purchased power requirements is also mitigated through a dollar cost averaging hedging plan using nymex futures contracts and options 
this is a multi year hedging plan 
as of december   we had financial contracts in place to price hedge approximately of our on peak natural gas and natural gas equivalent purchased power price exposure for additional factors that affect our commodity price exposure are the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume 
quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on the availability  price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and scheduled outages at our facilities that use fossil fuels 
our customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors 
market risk trading we are exposed to market risk  including changes in commodity prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions in accordance with our policy approved by the board of directors 
our trading portfolios consist primarily of natural gas  electricity  coal and interest rate contracts that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash 
these contracts take many forms  including futures  forwards  swaps and options 
as we are winding down our trading portfolio  most of our positions have been hedged to limit our exposure to the above risks 
we measure the risk in our trading portfolio using a value at risk methodology 
the value at risk calculation utilizes statistics to determine the relationship between the size of a potential loss and the probability of its occurrence  from holding an individual instrument or portfolio of instruments for a given period of time 
the quantification of market risk using value at risk methodologies provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products and is considered a best practice standard for this application 
the use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions  including selection of a confidence level we use  holding period this is the time needed to liquidate a position we use one day  and use of historical volatility and correlations with the most recent activity weighted more heavily 
the average value at risk var for all commodities during was million 
our board of directors sets our var limit 
we are currently limited to million for the remaining commodity trading portfolio and a million target for the aggregate book that includes the first months of merchant services asset positions 
in addition to var  we also apply other risk control measures that incorporate volumetric limits by commodity  loss limits  durational limits and application of stress testing to our various risk portfolios 
additionally  we have one remaining highly customized actuarial based contract  which expires in september  with life of contract var of approximately million at december  all merchant interest and foreign currency risks are monitored within the commodity portfolios and value at risk calculation 
the merchant commodity portfolios are valued on a mark to market basis that requires that the trading book be discounted on a net present value basis utilizing risk adjusted current interest rates based on our credit standing and those of our counterparties 
because interest rate movements impact the value of our trading portfolio  we actively hedge our interest rate exposures to limit these fluctuations 
certain trading activities we engage in price risk management activities for both trading and non trading activities 
transactions carried out in connection with trading activities that are derivatives under sfas are accounted for under the mark to market method of accounting 
through october  these contracts were accounted for under eitf which also required the use of the mark to market method 
under sfas  our energy commodity trading contracts  including physical transactions mainly gas and power and financial instruments  are recorded at fair value 
as part of the valuation of our portfolio  we value the credit risks associated with the financial condition of counterparties and the time value of money 
we primarily use quoted market prices from published sources or comparable transactions in liquid markets to value our contracts 
if actively quoted market prices are not available  we contact brokers and other external sources or use comparable transactions to obtain current values of our contracts 
in addition  the market prices or fair values used in determining the value of the portfolio are our best estimates utilizing information such as historical volatility  time value  counterparty credit and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating our positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  certain contracts are recorded at fair value using an alternative approach such as model pricing 
the changes in fair value of our trading and other contracts for are summarized below in millions total fair value at december  reduction in fair value during the year contracts realized or cash settled fair value at december  the fair value of contracts maturing in each of the next four years and thereafter are shown below in millions thereafter total prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources priced based on models and other valuation methods net price risk management assets liabilities credit risk in conducting our operations  we regularly transact business with a broad range of entities and a wide variety of end users  energy merchants  producers and financial institutions 
credit risk is measured by the loss we would record if our counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations less the value of any collateral held 
we have established policies  systems and controls to manage our exposure to credit risk 
this infrastructure allows us to assess counterparty creditworthiness  monitor credit exposures  stress test the portfolio to quantify future potential credit exposures and catalogue collateral received by the company 
in addition  to enhance the ongoing management of credit exposure  we have used master netting agreements whenever possible 
master netting agreements enable us to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty 
in situations where the credit quality of counterparties has deteriorated to certain levels  we will assert our contractual rights to minimize our exposures by requesting collateral against these obligations 
a natural result of our prior business strategy is the concentration of energy sector credit risk 
factors affecting this industry segment will affect the general credit quality of our portfolio both positively and negatively 
the result of energy industry downgrades of certain companies with significant energy merchant activity has reduced the overall credit quality of our exposures in general 
the following table details our credit exposures at december   associated with our forward positions within our trading portfolio and our billed receivables excluding residential customers  netted by counterparty where master netting agreements exist and by collateral to the extent any is held 
in millions investment grade non investment grade total utilities and merchants financial institutions oil and gas producers 

commercial and industrial total in our domestic utilities business  approximately of our sales are to residential customers 
therefore  our credit risk associated with these sales is relatively low 
see pages and under properties for a breakout of our customers by type 
currency rate exposure we have substantially wound down our united kingdom and canadian merchant trading businesses  which are included in our merchant services segment  and have sold our international utility businesses in canada  australia  new zealand and the united kingdom 
our remaining currency rate exposure relates only to approximately million of cash held in foreign countries  a limited trading portfolio in canada and the resolution of outstanding tax obligations and receivables 
interest rate exposure we have approximately million in unhedged variable rate financial obligations 
a basis point change in the variable rate financial instruments would affect net income by approximately million
