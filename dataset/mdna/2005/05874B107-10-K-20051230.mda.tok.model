restatement in connection with our year end closing process for  we identified certain possible errors in our accounting and previously reported financial information 
as a result  in september  we announced that we would delay filing our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  based on our extensive internal review described below  our board of directors concluded on november  that there were material errors in our previously reported financial information and consequently  that a restatement of our previously reported financial statements as of june  and for the fiscal years ended june  and and our previously reported unaudited financial information for the fiscal quarters ended june   september  and  december  and  and march  and was required 
our review process included an extensive assessment of our accounting methods and practices as well as our previously reported financial information 
this process  conducted by third party consultants and internal accountants under the direction of our senior management and with the oversight of the audit committee of the board of directors  consisted of an extensive review of our sales contracts  account reconciliations  financial information  and certain transactions 
our review determined that the accounting errors in our previously reported financial information and the failure to prevent or detect them in our financial reporting process were  in part  attributable to material weaknesses in our internal control over alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  financial reporting 
the material weaknesses are described in internal control over financial reporting in item a  controls and procedures 
the restatement decreased i gaming and systems revenues by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  ii cost of sales and other expenses by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  and iii income from continuing operations by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
we also recorded an adjustment to change the classification of certain certificates of deposit with maturities beyond days when purchased from cash and cash equivalents to other current assets  totaling million as of june   and an adjustment to change the classification of certain jackpot reserve cash accounts from cash and cash equivalents to restricted cash totaling million as of june  the company also determined that it should have presented the cash flows from discontinued operations within the respective operating  investing and financing activities in its statements of cash flows  rather than as one separate line item 
the cash flow statements were also adjusted for the change in the classification of the jackpot reserve cash accounts to restricted cash 
the following is a reconciliation of income from continuing operations as previously reported  to the restated amounts  by the categories discussed above in s income from continuing operations  as previously reported revenue recognition adjustments  net inventory adjustments  net other miscellaneous adjustments  net income from continuing operations  as restated the restatement also resulted in a reduction of retained earnings as of june  of million 
in connection with the restatement of our financial statements  deferred revenues and related deferred cost of sales as of june  were adjusted and total million and million  respectively 
the company expects a majority of such amounts to be recognized as revenue and cost of sales in fiscal year internal control over financial reporting we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which are described in item a  controls and procedures 
each of these material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
as a result  we have assessed that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of june  we are in the process of developing and implementing measures to address these material weaknesses 
the key issues identified by management during its assessment were the high level of turnover of certain of alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  our key finance and accounting personnel during fiscal  our inability to timely replace departed key personnel and the misinterpretation by management of certain complex accounting and tax issues 
we are making progress in the implementation of these measures however at present there can be no assurance as to when the implementation of these measures will be completed 
until such measures are implemented  we will continue to incur the expenses and management burdens associated with the additional resources required to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
we discuss the risks associated with the material weaknesses identified below under risk factors 
our business we are a worldwide leader in designing  manufacturing and distributing gaming machines  having marketed over  gaming machines during the past five years  and computerized monitoring systems for gaming facilities 
we also own and operate the rainbow casino  a dockside casino in vicksburg  mississippi  which has approximately table games and approximately gaming devices 
we derive our revenues from the following four sources gaming equipment sale of gaming machines systems sales of computerized monitoring systems and related recurring hardware and software maintenance revenue gaming operations operation of wide area progressive systems and lease of gaming machines casino operations operation of the rainbow casino critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include valuations utilized in asset impairment tests  acquisition accounting  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized costs  inventory valuation and deferred tax reserves 
these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
there can be no assurance that the actual results will not differ from our estimates 
additional information regarding our significant accounting policies is presented below 
revenue recognition our gaming equipment and systems revenue are recognized in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop no 
and are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the vendors fee is fixed or determinable collectibility is probable we sell gaming machines and our computerized monitoring systems either through normal credit terms of a days or less  or may grant extended credit terms of up to five years 
revenue is recorded in alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  accordance with the terms of sale for contracts with payment terms of months or less  or as cash is received for contracts with payment terms in excess of months 
games placed with customers on a trial basis are not recognized as revenue until the trial period ends  the customer accepts the games and collectibility is probable 
we also sell gaming devices under arrangements in which there are multiple elements  as that term is defined in sop no 
contracts may contain multiple elements such as a combination of gaming devices  central site monitoring equipment  systems software  license fees and training 
we allocate revenue to each element based upon its fair value as determined by vendor specific objective evidence 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately 
in addition  software license updates and product support services are measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
we recognize revenue when the product is delivered  or over the period in which the service is performed and we defer revenue for any undelivered elements 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered elements included in the arrangement  the revenues are deferred until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered element 
the majority of our software license arrangements is non perpetual and includes software license updates and product support which are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically one year 
software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades  maintenance and patches released during the term of the support period 
the majority of our customers purchase both software and hardware maintenance and product support when they purchase the systems 
in addition  substantially all customers renew these maintenance agreements annually 
revenue from multi year licensing arrangements are accounted for as subscriptions  with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period  generally one year 
our gaming operations earn recurring revenue that consists of the operation of wide area progressive jackpot systems and revenues from gaming machines placed in casinos on a daily lease or rental basis 
revenue from these sources is recognized based on the contractual terms of the participation or rental agreements and is generally based on a share of money wagered  a share of the net winnings  or on a fixed daily rental rate basis 
in accordance with industry practice  we recognize gaming revenues in our casino operations as the net win from gaming machine operations  which is the difference between coins and currency deposited into the machines and payments to customers 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost elements included for work in process and finished goods consist of raw materials  freight  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
given the size of the account balance  and the subjective nature of market values  management has determined that inventories represent critical accounting policies 
accordingly we regularly review inventory quantities and quality and record charges for both obsolete products and products that may have become impaired for a variety of reasons  including changes in technology  customer preferences and product demand 
additional valuation charges could result in the future as a result of these factors 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  property  plant and equipment and leased gaming equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives or lease terms  whichever is less  using the straight line method 
leased gaming equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from two to four years to an estimated residual value 
significant replacements and improvements are capitalized  while other maintenance and repairs are expensed 
the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income as appropriate 
given the changes in technology  customer preferences and product demand  we regularly review and evaluate the recoverability of our investment in such assets  as well as the estimated useful lives used to depreciate these assets 
there is the potential for acceleration of future depreciation  or even an asset write down  if such factors were determined to have an adverse impact on our ability to realize our full investment in such assets 
intangible assets  including goodwill we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate carrying value may not be recoverable or warrant a revision to the estimated remaining useful life in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets primarily consist of acquisition related software and trademarks  which are amortized over three to thirteen years  and goodwill which is not amortized 
some of the intangibles represent products that have been deployed such as sdg s central determination games and others that are just now being deployed such as mindplay s table game technology 
the success or failure of such products and their ability to generate future cash flows will have a significant impact on the timing of amortization expense and or write downs in those future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets are measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  undiscounted and without interest 
such estimations involve significant judgments 
if such assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
for assets held for sale  the company carries such assets at fair value less estimated costs to sell 
jackpot liabilities we recognize a liability for jackpots not yet won and jackpot expense for the cost to fund jackpots in the future 
jackpots are payable in either equal installments over a year period or immediately in the case of instant win progressive jackpots 
winners may elect to receive a single payment for the present value of a jackpot discount at applicable interest rates in lieu of annual installments 
our jackpot liabilities totaled million at june   including million for the consolidated vie s  and totaled million at june  changes in our estimates and assumptions  including the number of jackpot winners who may elect single payments in the future could impact our jackpot expense and jackpot liability 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  allowances for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained at levels determined by our management to adequately provide for collection losses 
in determining estimated losses  management considers economic conditions  the activity in gaming markets  the financial condition of customers  changes in technology and other factors which management believes are relevant 
capitalized costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  internally generated software development costs associated with new products and significant enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
we incur significant regulatory approval costs for our products 
such costs are capitalized once technological feasibility has been established and are amortized generally over three years reflective of the estimated product life cycle 
product testing costs related to projects that are discontinued are expensed when such determination is made 
fees incurred for such regulatory approvals totaled approximately million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
of these amounts incurred  during the fiscal years ended june  and  we capitalized a total of million and million respectively that was directly attributable to products  and amortization expense for previously capitalized amounts totaled million and million respectively 
during fiscal year  we modified our capitalization policy  which previously had no minimum  to capitalize individual charges greater than given the subjective nature of such capitalized costs  we have instituted a strict review process that includes a full review of the costs incurred and the nature and prospects of the related product 
after costs are capitalized  they are monitored to ensure that they are earning revenues through product sales 
future write offs are possible if such products do not produce adequate cash flows 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
taxes on income of our foreign subsidiaries are provided at the tax rates applicable to the tax jurisdictions in which they are located 
the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets is based in part on estimates of future income and the timing of temporary differences  and the failure to fully realize such deferred tax assets could result in a higher tax provision in future periods 
our net deferred tax assets totaled million and million at june  and  respectively 
our accrued income taxes totaled million at june  and million at june  alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires recognition of share based compensation in the financial statements beginning with our fiscal quarter ended september  we will continue to compute compensation expense for stock options using the black scholes valuation model  and will utilize the modified prospective method for adoption of sfas r 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment sab no 
 to provide interpretive guidance on sfas no 
r valuation methods  assumptions used in valuation models  and the interaction of sfas no 
r with existing sec guidance 
sab no 
also requires the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line as cash compensation  and will therefore impact our cost of gaming equipment and systems  casino operations and related gross profits and margins  research and development costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we estimate that the expensing of stock options will reduce per net income for fiscal year by approximately million or per share for the unvested options outstanding as of june  this amount excludes the accelerated vesting of approximately million options in june see note to the consolidated financial statements

casino operations revenue represents approximately  and of total revenue for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
further descriptions of the fluctuations between fiscal year ends are discussed in depth under each respective segment disclosure below 
bally gaming and systems through our bally gaming and systems segment we are one of the leading providers of technology to the gaming industry 
the gaming industry has been moving to games which use ticket in ticket out tito technology over the last several years  thereby reducing coin handling costs and down time for games waiting on the casino floor 
during fiscal year  the sale of new gaming devices in the domestic market declined as a result of the rapid adoption of tito capable games during the preceding years 
in addition  during fiscal year  there were fewer new casino openings and there were no new domestic markets that opened 
we believe that fiscal year will represent an opportunity for modest revenue growth for our gaming equipment and gaming operations divisions 
our expectation is based on our belief that the majority of casino operators will not return to their traditional buying patterns for replacement games during fiscal year  the domestic market expansion opportunities remain uncertain and several of the international market opportunities that we are currently pursuing will likely not impact our financial results until fiscal year and beyond 
in addition  the aftermath of hurricane katrina will negatively impact our wide area and daily fee revenues throughout fiscal year however  we anticipate that the negative impact of hurricane katrina on our gaming equipment and gaming operations divisions may be offset by sales to properties as they reopen during fiscal year and beyond 
we believe that systems revenues could increase in fiscal year as a result of casino operators continued focus on promotions and bonusing software as tools to enhance their player loyalty programs 
in addition  we provide systems technology to several of the large multi property casino operators that have made recent acquisitions or are currently developing new properties  and we anticipate such customers will deploy our systems technology solutions 
however  the wide number of new products that we are introducing  the uncertain market conditions and the changing competitive landscape make forecasting for fiscal year particularly difficult

fiscal total revenues increased million or in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year due to the following gaming equipment 
gaming equipment revenue decreased by million or primarily due to the decrease in domestic new unit sales to  units sold in fiscal year as compared to  units sold in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in total units sold reflects the general casino industry reduction in new unit purchases which followed the rapid pace of ticket in ticket out game replacements which occurred over the prior two years 
in addition  the company s legacy video products did not perform as well as competitor products  which led to the company s decision to move to the new alpha game engine 
during  there were very few new casino openings in the united states 
the decrease in domestic new unit sales was partially offset by a increase in international new unit sales from  in fiscal year to  in the current fiscal year as we expanded our marketing efforts outside the united states and a increase in the new unit average selling price 
we believe that foreign markets will likely expand in coming years  and will be an important source of revenues for us 
we will continue to dedicate research and development to developing products for foreign markets 
systems 
systems revenue decreased million or primarily as a result of a decrease in new property installations in the current year 
in the current year  new property installations represented approximately million of systems revenue compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in new property installations resulted from the above mentioned slowdown following the tito system upgrades in the prior two years  and the reduced number of new casino openings during the current year 
a million increase in deferral of revenue for contracts with non perpetual licenses based on the accounting under sop no 
the decrease in new property installations was partially offset by an increase in recurring hardware and software maintenance revenue of or million to million due to the larger base of installed units 
gaming operations 
gaming operations revenue increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to the following an increase in revenue of million or to million from centrally determined linked games due to a full year of revenue compared to four months in the prior year due to the acquisition of sdg in march an increase in the installed base of games and the benefits of certain class ii enhancements  such as the one system  for which we are generating additional daily fee revenue 
an increase in daily fee games placements of and an increase in average revenue per day for both wide area progressives and monte carlo daily fee games 
gross margin declined to primarily as a result of the write off of obsolete inventory in the amount of million and an increase in sales of class ii games  which traditionally have a lower sale margin when compared to traditional or class iii games and which is compensated by the recurring revenue stream they generate through license fee arrangements that have terms of three to five years 
the inventory write off was primarily a result of a substantial retooling of our product lines to the new alpha platform and the decline in the current market conditions 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  selling  general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of the following the addition of class ii and central determination operations for a full year in fiscal year an increase in legal expense of approximately million resulting from higher patent and litigation costs 
an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts receivable of million  which includes a charge for a large customer that declared bankruptcy during fiscal year severance charges of million for reductions in the workforce both domestically and in our european operations 
we continued to make progress on reducing selling  general and administrative costs during the last half of the fiscal year research and development costs increased as a result of the increased investment in the development of the alpha engine system and related game content  and sustaining development of multiple existing game platforms and systems 
depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the increase in acquisition related intangible assets and the increased base of wide area and daily fee games 
fiscal vs 
fiscal total revenues increased million or in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year due to the following gaming equipment 
gaming equipment revenue increased by million or primarily due to the acquisition of sdg in march  which contributed an incremental million 
higher domestic new unit sales due to increased sales of tito games and sales to several new casinos which opened during the year 
systems 
systems revenue increased by million or primarily as a result of increased sales to multi property operators resulting from displacements of competitor systems which occurred as certain casinos were acquired by larger multi property operators 
increased sales of software licenses for our tito solution  as well as its bonusing and promotions software  caused by the casino industry focus on improved marketing and player retention programs and operating cost efficiencies achieved with tito systems and games which reduces coin handling 
recurring hardware and software maintenance revenue increased by to million for the fiscal year  resulting from the larger base of installed units  which now stands at approximately  gaming operations 
gaming operations revenue increased for fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year due to an increase of in the installed base of daily fee games deployed  which increased to  units installed 
this increase is primarily a result of the launch of the new york lottery operations and the acquisition of sdg 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  gross margin improved to as a result of higher margin systems sales and gaming operations revenue  as a proportion of total sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year over primarily due to the acquisitions of sdg  mindplay and crown gaming  ltd  as well as the launch of the new york lottery resulting in increases in all operating expense categories except bad debt expense 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses also increased as a result of higher legal costs related to the protection of our intellectual property rights and higher payroll and payroll related costs primarily in our customer service departments 
research and development costs increased primarily as a result of increased headcount and reflect the additional costs incurred to expand our product offerings 
depreciation and amortization increased as a result of increased capital expenditures and an increase in acquisition related intangible assets 
casino operations our rainbow casino is one of four casinos currently operating in the vicksburg  mississippi market 
our casino primarily draws customers from within a mile radius  which includes jackson  mississippi 
we believe that fiscal year will represent a year of modest revenue growth for our casino 
while a number of properties located on the gulf coast sustained heavy damage  our casino was not damaged during the hurricanes season 
although it was temporarily closed  we reopened the property for business within four days of hurricane katrina once power was restored to the general area 
while the play levels at our casino have generally increased following the reopening  we anticipate that the play level may return to a more typical level once the gulf coast casinos reopen

fiscal rainbow casino revenue was relatively flat in fiscal year compared to the prior year in a market that grew for the year with the majority of the increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal year due to completion of capital improvement projects in the vicksburg market

increase in legal fees of million during the fiscal year  relative to the ongoing sec investigation and other related matters 
we expect these higher costs to continue in fiscal year increase in professional fees of million related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
we expect these additional costs to continue into fiscal year minority interest increased as a result of the consolidation of certain variable interest entities 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  as a result of a refinancing completed during fiscal year  we recorded a pre tax charge in the quarter ended september  of million 
in december  we amended our bank loan agreement  which resulted in a charge of million which was classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt 
interest expense for the current year totaled million compared to million in the prior year period due to higher interest rates on lower total debt outstanding 
virtually all of our debt is floating rate  therefore future interest expense will be impacted by future changes in the libor which is the base rate for our interest payments 
our effective income tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal year was approximately 
this rate reflects a federal tax benefit computed using a rate of offset by a tax charge for the estimated potential tax liability for the reorganization of our european distribution operations  as well as reserves applied to certain deferred tax assets 
the effective rate for fiscal year is expected to be between and 
fiscal vs 
fiscal general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of increase in general corporate legal costs resulting from the class action lawsuit and related matters 
increase in general liability and director and officer insurance costs resulting from market conditions 
total other expense increased as a result of the september refinancing of our credit facilities 
the refinancing charge of million was partially offset by decreases in our net interest expense as a result of the lower interest rates achieved in the refinancing 
significant items effecting comparability inventory and asset write downs we perform detailed inventory valuation procedures at least quarterly 
this process includes examining the carrying values of new and used gaming devices  parts and ancillary equipment in comparison to the current fair market values for such equipment less costs to sell or dispose 
some of the factors involved in this analysis include the overall levels of our inventories  the current and projected sales levels for such products  the projected markets for such products both domestically and internationally  the costs required to sell the products including refurbishment costs and importation costs for international shipments  and the overall projected demand for products once the next generation of products are scheduled for release 
during fiscal year we faced declining demand for gaming devices based on our legacy platform  and therefore we continually assessed this particular portion of our inventory 
in october  we made the strategic decision to move to our new alpha video platform  which was made commercially available in april in most markets 
the decision to move our gaming devices to the new video platform  the targeting of used equipment for non domestic markets  and the consolidation of certain warehouses all led to accelerated disposals of legacy products 
this process has required continual updating of estimates for the net realizable value of alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  inventories due to the subjectivity involved in projecting sales volumes  used game sales values  refurbishment costs  and customer demand in non domestic jurisdictions 
as a result of our ongoing analysis of inventory valuations  we have taken a series of inventory and related asset write downs totaling million during fiscal year  which included a charge of million in the fourth quarter 
we continue to hold a significant number of used gaming devices  therefore there can be no assurances that further write downs will not occur in subsequent periods 
impairment charges we entered into an agreement during fiscal year to provide a development loan to a native american tribe to further their pursuit of developing a gaming facility 
the amounts advanced under the terms of the loan totaled million  and we are not obligated for any additional advances 
in march  the tribe received an adverse court ruling that we believe materially impairs the tribe s ability to pay the loan  and we therefore recorded an impairment charge for the full amount of the loan 
during the march quarter  we performed a review of our intellectual property rights for various video games used on our then existing video platforms  which we refer to as our legacy platform 
this review was triggered by the declining sales of the games using our legacy platform during fiscal year we evaluated the carrying value of certain intellectual property assets and determined that several were no longer recoverable and were therefore deemed to be impaired 
the impairment charge totaled million 
during the march quarter  we also evaluated the useful lives and salvage values for our leased gaming equipment 
based on recent historical data indicating a shortening of the average length such games were deployed  we decided to reduce the depreciable life for certain video products to two years 
the change in the useful life resulted in an impairment charge of million to write off the undepreciated portion of the game values down to salvage value for games at the end of their two year life 
refinancing and loan amendment charges during fiscal year  we amended our bank loan agreement 
the fee incurred for the amendment totaled approximately million  and resulted in a charge of million to write off a portion of the previously capitalized fees 
during fiscal year  we initiated a tender offer for all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due  which we refer to as our senior subordinated notes  at a price of plus a 
tender premium 
the offer was completed on september  as a result  we recorded a pre tax charge in the september quarter of million  which included a million charge of the early extinguishment of the senior subordinated notes  million for the write off of deferred financing costs  and million in fees and expenses 
severance charges during fiscal year  we undertook an extensive review of our operations and reduced our workforce during the september quarter and the march quarter 
as a result of these reductions in force  we incurred severance charges totaling million for the fiscal year alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  discontinued operations as previously discussed  we sold our nevada route operations  the rail city casino and bally wulff during fiscal year on june   we completed the sale of united coin to century gaming  inc and received approximately million in cash and the assumption by century gaming of approximately million in debt 
additionally  century gaming has agreed to acquire a certain number of gaming devices from our bally gaming and systems business unit over a five year period 
united coin revenue totaled million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
for the same periods  operating income totaled million and million respectively 
in fiscal year  we reported a gain on the sale before income taxes of million  or million after tax 
during fiscal year  the gain on sale was adjusted for charges incurred for an adverse outcome in a patent infringement case and the resolution of certain sale related liabilities  the sum of which totaled million net of tax  which is included in the discontinued operations section of the statement of operations for the fiscal year ended june  the sale of the rail city casino to the sands regent was completed on may  total consideration was million in cash 
rail city revenue totaled million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively

we recorded a gain on the sale of million or million after taxes in fiscal year  which is included in the discontinued operations section of the statement of operations for the fiscal year ended june  recent developments in late august  a devastating hurricane hit the gulf coast of mississippi and louisiana causing substantial damage to the gulfport and biloxi  mississippi area  as well as new orleans  louisiana 
in september  louisiana was again impacted by a severe hurricane that caused additional flooding in new orleans as well as other locations in louisiana 
we earn revenue in both louisiana and mississippi from machine rentals and participations in various casinos that were damaged by the hurricanes 
in some instances  the machines have been damaged or destroyed  in other cases  the machines are undamaged  but the casinos are currently closed 
we carry both property and business interruption insurance which will serve to offset some of the losses indicated above 
at this time we are actively working with our insurance providers to assess losses and associated recoveries  but anticipate the full claim cycle will cover an extended period of time 
therefore  we cannot reasonably estimate the net proceeds to be recovered in connection with these losses 
initial indications are that the casinos in the biloxi and gulfport areas will need to be rebuilt and will not open for a protracted period of time 
some casinos may decide not to rebuild 
casinos in new orleans may need major reconstruction and  given the devastation in the area  may be closed for months 
casinos alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  outside of these areas may also need some restoration  but others have reopened for business  although their business may be at lower than historical levels 
for the september quarter  the impact on our gaming operations division as a result of the hurricane is estimated to be less than per diluted share 
revenue was negatively impacted by approximately million related to games scheduled to be sold to customers in the affected area  with an associated gross margin of million 
our balance sheet exposure for accounts receivable and net book value of games placed in affected casinos is approximately million 
management believes that the impact of the hurricane will continue throughout fiscal year at this time we estimate the total impact to revenue and gross margin will be million and million  respectively  for fiscal year period 
financial condition liquidity as of june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  we had net working capital of approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from june   which is explained in working capital below 
consolidated cash and cash equivalents at june  includes approximately million of cash utilized in our casino operations that is held in vaults  cages or change banks 
additionally  pursuant to various state gaming regulations  certain cash accounts totaling approximately million as of june   are maintained to ensure availability of funds to pay wide area progressive jackpot awards which are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we purchase us treasury strip securities for the benefit of jackpot winners who elect to receive annual or weekly installment payments 
these securities are included in restricted long term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  and totaled million and million as of june  and  respectively 
on september   we completed a refinancing transaction whereby we entered into a new million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
we used the proceeds from the refinancing transaction to repay an aggregate of approximately million outstanding under our existing term loan  repurchase the million aggregate amount of our senior subordinated notes  and pay million in transaction fees and expenses 
the fees and expenses were capitalized and are being amortized on the straight line basis over the remaining term of the loan 
the term loan has a per year mandatory principal amortization after the first year  and a six year maturity 
the revolving credit facility commitment decreases ratably over its five year term to a balloon 
in december  we increased the term loan by million to a total of million 
we used the proceeds primarily to fund the acquisition of sdg 
as a result of the increase  we incurred an additional million in debt issuance costs  which amount has been capitalized and is amortized on the straight line basis over the remaining term of the term loan 
the sale of our rail city casino was completed in may  and the sale of united coin was completed in june the bank loan agreement governing the term loan and the revolving credit facility required that we use approximately of the net proceeds from the disposition of these assets to reduce the term loan and revolving credit facility principal balances on a pro rata basis 
as a result  in august   we made a payment to permanently reduce the term loan by million  and paid down the revolving credit facility from million to zero 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  in december  we amended our bank loan agreement 
the amendment provides for an increase in the maximum allowable leverage ratio under the bank loan agreement to a minimum of times at june   which declines thereafter  a reduction in the revolving credit facility commitment to million and an increase in the term loan interest rate to libor plus  which can be adjusted to be libor plus based on certain credit rating and leverage ratio criteria 
we incurred a fee of approximately million in connection with the amendment 
as of june   we had million outstanding under our term loan accruing interest at a rate of  and zero outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
as a result of the additional time required to complete the year end closing process we failed to deliver to our lenders our audited financial statements and the unaudited interim financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended september  in a timely manner  and therefore were not in compliance with certain of our debt covenants under the bank loan agreement 
pursuant to an agreement with the lenders  we can cure the default by delivering the financial statements to the lenders by december  immediately upon the filing of this annual report on form k we intend to deliver to the lenders our audited financial statements and the unaudited interim financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended september  which we believe will cure the default 
during the default period through the date of the filing of this annual report on form k  we incurred default interest of approximately million 
see risk factors below for a discussion of the risks associated with our non compliance with certain of our debt covenants under the bank loan agreement 
we are in compliance with our financial covenants under the bank loan agreement  which consist of a leverage ratio  a fixed charges coverage ratio  and a minimum ebitda as that term is defined in the bank loan agreement ratio 
the leverage ratio is computed as total average debt outstanding during the quarter divided by the trailing months ebitda excluding certain cash and non cash charges  and is further adjusted to remove ebitda from discontinued operations at the time those operations are sold 
the company s leverage ratio as of june  was times versus the covenant maximum of times 
cash flows from operating activities are derived primarily from the cash receipts from the sale of goods and services  the operation of wide area progressive systems  lease payments  and monthly cash receipts from maintenance agreements for our casino systems customers 
in addition  we generate cash through our casino operations 
we utilize our cash to acquire materials for the manufacture of goods for resale or lease  payroll  and all other selling  general and administrative expenses 
management believes that cash flows from current operating activities and the availability under the revolving credit facility will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity 
although the leverage ratio limited our availability under the revolving credit facility at june   access to the revolving credit facility in the future will depend on our ability to generate adequate levels of ebitda  as described above 
at june   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  working capital the following table presents the components of consolidated working capital at june  and dollars in s change change cash and cash equivalents restricted cash accounts and notes receivable  net inventories deferred tax assets  net other current assets assets of discontinued operations held for sale total current assets accounts payable accrued liabilities jackpot liabilities deferred revenue taxes payable current maturities of long term debt liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale total current liabilities net working capital for the year ended june   our net working capital  declined million 
the million decrease in cash and cash equivalents was most significantly impacted by our use of million in proceeds from the sale of united coin and rail city to pay down the term loan and revolving credit facility in accordance with the bank loan agreement  as discussed above  as well as cash used to deploy wide area and daily fee gaming devices 
the decrease in working capital was also affected by a net decrease in accounts and notes receivable relating to the early payments by certain significant customers  as well as our lower revenue levels in the second half of fiscal year  which were caused by the transition to the new alpha game engine  and a reduction in purchases by casinos following the tito placements over the preceding two years 
a net decrease in inventory  which resulted from inventory obsolescence non cash charges of million 
excluding such charges  inventory increased million during fiscal year due to the build up of inventory related to our new products being introduced 
a decrease in other assets  primarily as a result of i a million decrease in deferred costs directly related to deferred revenues discussed below  ii a decrease in refundable deposits of million and iii a decrease in prepaid insurance and royalties  all of which were offset by a million increase in trial games 
a decrease in accrued liabilities  primarily as a result of i a million decrease in deferred revenue of related to transactions involving the delivery of games and systems not meeting the alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  revenue recognition requirements of sop no 
in fiscal that were subsequently recognized in fiscal  ii a decrease of approximately million in divesture related accruals for the sale of united coin  iii a million decrease in payroll and payroll related accruals  and iv a million decrease in royalty accrual due to lower sales  all of which were partially offset by a million increase in patent litigation accruals 
cash flow during the year ended june   cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations totaled million as a result of a reported net loss of million  which includes certain non cash inventory and asset impairment charges totaling million  primarily resulting from the writedown of certain legacy products to net realizable value due primarily to the introduction of the alpha game engine 
an increase in inventory of million  primarily resulting from the build up of inventory related to our new products being introduced 
a decrease in accounts and notes receivables of million  primarily resulting from a decrease in fourth quarter sales of million from fiscal to  that was primarily related to the strategic shift to our new alpha game engine sales of which began late in the june quarters 
a decrease in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and jackpot liabilities of million  due primarily to timing of payments to vendors and lower levels of purchases due to the lower fourth quarter sales levels discussed above 
during the year ended june   cash flows used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled million as a result of capital expenditures of million

cash provided from exercise of stock options of million 
million in cash used to pay the fees and expenses related to the amendment of the bank loan agreement amendment discussed above 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  contractual commitments we are committed to make future payments pursuant to various contracts and agreements 
a summary of those contractual obligations existing as of june   is as follows in s total debt term loan facility a revolving credit facility b subordinated debt c other debt estimated interest payments d other commitments net minimum rentals mindplay earn out e purchase commitments f employment agreements g kirkland consulting agreement h total commitments a the term loan facility requires principal payments of million per year with the balance due in b there are currently no amounts outstanding on the million revolving credit facility 
c in december  we agreed to terminate the sdg earn out for million  of which million was paid in cash and million in the form of an unsecured promissory note 
in june  million of the principal balance of the unsecured promissory note was extinguished through the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock 
the remaining million outstanding as of june  is payable over the subsequent five years 
d our debt is virtually all variable rate tied to libor  therefore  we computed the estimated future interest payments for our total debt outstanding based on the average interest rate in effect as of june  of 
e pursuant to the mindplay purchase agreement  we are obligated to make certain contingent earn out payments to the former principals of mindplay  amounts that cannot currently be estimated 
f except in certain rare instances  bally gaming and systems is not required by its suppliers to enter into quarterly commitments for products 
g we have employment agreements with most of our employees with positions of vice president or above 
these agreements generally provide for an initial rate of pay and the terms of the severance benefits generally range from three to twelve months salary continuation with similar non compete periods 
almost all such agreements contain language that the employee is still an at will employee  and as such can be terminated at anytime subject to the individual termination provisions 
the only multi year arrangement is with richard haddrill  our ceo effective october   which covers a three year term  with a base salary of  only mr 
haddrill s compensation is reflected in the table above 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  h pursuant to an advisory agreement with kirkland investment corporation owned by joel kirschbaum who is a director of alliance  and therefore treated as a related party dated july   we agreed to pay kirkland  annually for a period of years for consulting services 
our long term debt is virtually all floating rate and therefore future interest payments will be impacted by future libor rate changes as well as the balance of debt outstanding in those future periods 
interest payments for fiscal year totaled million 
the payment obligations in the above table are based on the contractually scheduled due dates 
the only payment acceleration that could be demanded of us would generally be in the event of a default under the bank credit agreement that was not cured within the provisions set forth in that agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
risk factors investing in our common stock involves risks 
prospective investors in our common stock should carefully consider  among other things  the following factors and other information contained in this document  including our financial statements and the notes to those statements  prior to making an investment decision 
we have identified the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements we may make from time to time 
the gaming industry is intensely competitive 
we face competition from a number of companies  some of which have greater resources  and if we are unable to compete effectively  our business could be negatively impacted 
bally gaming and systems competition among gaming machine manufacturers is based on  among other things  competitive customer pricing and financing terms  appeal to the player  product quality and having an extensive distribution and sales network 
there are a number of established  well financed and well known companies producing machines that compete with each bally gaming and systems product line in each of the bally gaming and systems markets 
while there are a number of competitors in the field  a single competitor  igt  dominates the domestic market for gaming machines 
in addition  certain technology oriented companies recently entered or may soon enter the gaming machine market 
certain of these competitors have access to greater capital resources than we do  and as a result  may be better positioned to compete in the marketplace 
the casino enterprise systems market is crowded  with igt  aristocrat  acres gaming  inc  mis and  to a lesser extent  konami and mikohn gaming corporation  comprising the competition 
the competition is intense due to the number of providers  as well as the limited number of casinos and jurisdictions in which they operate 
pricing  product feature and function  accuracy and reliability are all main factors in determining a provider s success in selling its system 
casino operations the principal competitive factors in the casino operations industry include the quality and location of the facility  the nature and quality of the amenities and customer services offered  and the implementation alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  and success of marketing programs 
our rainbow casino in vicksburg  mississippi faces intense direct competition from other gaming facilities serving the vicksburg market 
as the overall size of the potential customer base is limited  competition from casinos in nearby locations may further dilute the market from which vicksburg casinos draw most of their patrons 
moreover  additional potential gaming sites remain in and around vicksburg 
some of these sites may be closer to larger population centers and  if developed  may enjoy a competitive advantage over our casino 
our success in the gaming industry depends in large part on our ability to develop innovative products and systems  if we fail to keep pace with rapid change in product design  manufacturing and marketing strategies our business could be negatively impacted 
our revenues depend on the earning power and life span of our games 
newer games tend to have a shorter life than more traditional games  and as a result  we face pressure to design and deploy successful games to maintain our revenue stream and to remain competitive 
our future success depends to a large extent upon our ability to continue to design  manufacture and market technologically sophisticated and entertaining products that achieve high levels of player acceptance 
however  our ability to develop new and innovative products could be adversely affected by a decline in the popularity of our gaming products with players  a lack of success in developing new products  services or systems  an inability to roll out new games  services or systems on schedule as a result of delays in connection with regulatory product approval in the applicable jurisdictions  or otherwise  an increase in the popularity of competitors games  and a negative change in the trend of consumer acceptance of our newest systems innovations including our alpha game engine and our mindplay system 
the competitive contract terms required in non traditional gaming markets may affect our future revenues 
management believes that customer leasing and financing terms have become increasingly important competitive factors for the company in non traditional markets such as class ii and other native american jurisdictions 
we sometimes are required to grant extended payment terms on gaming machines  systems and other gaming equipment to gain entry into a developing market that we would not otherwise extend 
while the product normally collateralizes these financings  in an event of default  the resale value of the collateral may be considerably less than the amount financed 
accordingly  we have greater exposure to fluctuations in the financial condition of our customers in emerging markets than has historically been the case in the established markets 
the unpredictable growth of non traditional gaming markets may affect our business and prospects 
the continued growth of non traditional gaming markets for electronic gaming machines  systems and other gaming equipment depends heavily on the public s acceptance of gaming in these markets  as well as the ongoing development of the regulatory approval process by national and local governmental authorities 
a portion of our growth is directly tied to our ability to access these new markets 
we cannot predict which new jurisdictions or markets  if any  will approve the operation of electronic gaming machines  the timing of any such approval  the public s acceptance of our gaming machines in these markets or our market share or profitability in these markets 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  we may not be able to attract or retain the management or employees necessary to remain competitive in our industry 
the competition for qualified personnel in the gaming industry is intense 
our future success depends on the retention and continued contributions of our key management  finance  marketing  and staff personnel  many of whom would be difficult or impossible to replace 
our success is also tied to our ability to recruit additional key personnel in the future 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current personnel or recruit any additional key personnel required 
in addition  we do not have employment agreements with many members of our senior management 
the loss of services of any of our personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
the gaming industry is heavily regulated and changes in regulation by gaming authorities may adversely impact our ability to operate the business 
the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines and the conduct of gaming operations are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign regulation by various gaming authorities 
our ability to continue to operate in certain jurisdictions could be adversely affected by unfavorable public referendums  unfavorable legislation affecting or directed at manufacturers or gaming operators  such as referendums to increase taxes on gaming revenues  adverse changes in or finding of non compliance with applicable governmental gaming regulations  delays in approvals from regulatory agencies  a limitation  conditioning  suspension or revocation of any of our gaming licenses  and unfavorable determinations or challenges of suitability by gaming regulatory authorities with respect to our officers  directors  major stockholders or key personnel 
although the laws  rules and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we operate vary in their technical requirements  virtually each jurisdiction requires licenses  permits  qualification documentation  including evidence of integrity and financial stability  and other forms of approval to engage in gaming operations or the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines 
our officers  directors  major stockholders and key personnel are also subject to significant regulatory scrutiny 
in the event that gaming or governmental authorities determine that any person is unsuitable to act in such capacity with respect to the company  we could be required to terminate our relationship with such person 
to our knowledge  the company and our key personnel have obtained  or applied for  all government licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits and approvals necessary to conduct their respective activities in the various jurisdictions that we operate 
however  there can be no assurance those licenses  registrations  findings of suitability  permits or approvals will be renewed in the future  or that new forms of approval necessary to operate in emerging or existing markets will be given 
gaming operators are subject to additional taxes and fees that could change at any time 
the gaming industry is typically subject to significant taxation and fee assessment in addition to those corporate and state income taxes generally assessed on business operations 
these additional taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time  and may be materially increased either prospectively or alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  retroactively 
there can be no assurance as to future changes in taxation and fee assessment on the gaming industry 
any material increase could adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
our intellectual property protections may be insufficient to properly safeguard our technology  expenses incurred with respect to protecting and defending intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 
the gaming industry is constantly employing new technologies in both new and existing markets 
we rely on a combination of patent and other technical security measures to protect our products  and continue to file for patents protecting such technologies 
notwithstanding these safeguards  our competitors may still be able to obtain our technology or to imitate our products 
furthermore  others may independently develop products similar or superior to ours 
competitors and other third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights  or may allege that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights 
we may incur significant litigation expenses protecting our intellectual property or defending our use of intellectual property  reducing our ability to fund product initiatives 
these expenses could have an adverse effect on our future cash flow and results of operations 
we are currently subject to litigation regarding patent infringement which  if resolved adverse to the company  could have material impact on our business 
litigation can also divert management focus from running the day to day operations of the business 
there can be no assurances that certain of our products  including those with currently pending patent applications  will not be determined to have infringed upon an existing third party patent 
we are currently subject to securities and derivative litigation  the unfavorable outcome of which might have a material adverse effect on our business 
a number of federal class action lawsuits and state derivative lawsuits have been filed against us  including certain of our current and former officers  alleging violations of securities laws 
we strongly believe that these lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending them and have notified our applicable insurers 
we cannot  however  determine with certainty the outcome or resolution of these claims or the timing of their ultimate resolution 
in addition to the expense and burden incurred in defending these lawsuits and any damages that we may suffer  our management s efforts and attention may be diverted from the ordinary business operations in order to address these claims 
if the final resolution of any of these lawsuits is unfavorable to us  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity might be materially adversely affected if our existing insurance coverage is unavailable or inadequate to resolve the matter 
the restatement may subject us to actions or additional litigation which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we have restated our previously issued audited financial statements as of june   and for the fiscal years ended june  and and other related financial information for the fiscal years ended june   and and the unaudited information for the fiscal quarters ended june   september  and  december  and  and march  and the restatement may result in additional scrutiny in our ongoing sec investigation or to new regulatory actions or civil litigation which could require us to pay fines or other penalties or damages and could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the restatement may also result in negative publicity and we may lose or fail to attract and retain key customers  employees and management personnel as a result of these matters 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  in some jurisdictions  audited financial statements must be filed with the gaming regulatory authorities 
the late filing of this annual report on form k could generate inquiries from regulators  including possible disciplinary action 
however  the company has been keeping regulators informed of the situation and has received no indication that any disciplinary action will be filed in any jurisdiction 
ongoing sec investigations could adversely affect us 
the sec had been conducting an informal inquiry into certain matters surrounding the allegations relating to the securities class action litigation and our methods of revenue recognition 
on august   the sec issued a formal order of investigation with respect to these matters 
in accordance with its normal practice  the sec has not advised us when its investigation may be concluded  and we are unable to predict the outcome of this investigation 
while we are cooperating fully with the investigation  adverse developments in connection with the investigation  including any expansion of the scope of the investigation  could negatively impact us and could divert the efforts and attention of our management team from our ordinary business operations 
in connection with any sec investigation  it is possible that we will be required to  among other things  pay fines  consent to injunctions on future conduct  further restate our financial statements or suffer other penalties  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  which could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows accurately 
as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  management has conducted an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting 
in performing our assessment management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of june  for a detailed description of these material weaknesses  see item a  controls and procedures 
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information 
we have taken and will continue to take certain measures to strengthen our internal controls  as set forth under item a  controls and procedures 
however  additional work remains to be done to address the identified material weaknesses 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation initiatives plan  or fail to update our internal controls as our business evolves  or to integrate acquired businesses into our controls system  we may not be able to report accurately our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows or maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures 
if we are unable to report financial information accurately or maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures  we could be subject to  among other things  an additional sec enforcement action  additional securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence  any one of which by itself could adversely affect our business and prospects 
we face increased costs and have extensive work remaining to remedy the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
we have extensive work remaining to remedy the identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
this work has extended into the fiscal year and will continue until we are able to remediate the material weaknesses we have identified 
these matters have required  and will continue to require  a significant amount of management time and a significant commitment of external resources 
the costs of these efforts are substantial and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial performance 
we expect that they will continue to do so in future periods 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  certain consequences of our reporting situation under the federal securities laws may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  including our ability to raise capital 
our failure to meet the reporting requirements of the federal securities laws affects our ability to access the capital markets 
we are restricted in our ability to make any registered offering of securities until we can present unaudited interim financial statements for the september quarter 
we are also ineligible to use short form registration that allows us to incorporate by reference our form k  form q and other sec reports into our registration statements  or shelf registration until we have filed all of our periodic reports in a timely manner for a period of twelve months 
we are also ineligible to use form s until we have prepared and filed all of our delinquent periodic reports 
we use form s to register grants of equity compensation to our employees  including grants in the form of options and restricted stock 
the unavailability of form s reduces our flexibility in granting options and restricted stock to our employees 
in addition  the nyse has broad power to commence delisting proceedings for violations of its rules and may do so at any time 
because we are late in making our sec filings  the nyse could commence delisting proceedings against the company  however  they have not indicated an intention to do so 
consumer spending on leisure activities is affected by changes in the economy and consumer tastes  as well as other factors that are difficult to predict and beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that demand for our products or services will remain constant 
consumers willingness to spend money on leisure activities such as gaming is affected by changes in the economy and consumer tastes  both of which are both difficult to predict and beyond our control 
continued adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world  including a general tightening of the availability of credit  increasing interest rates  increasing energy costs  acts of war or terrorism  natural disasters  declining consumer confidence or significant declines in the stock market could lead to a further reduction in discretionary spending on leisure activities adversely affecting our business 
international operations  unfavorable political developments  weak foreign economies and other foreign risks may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is dependent on international markets as a portion of our revenues 
as of june   bally gaming and systems had million of receivables  or of our total receivables  from customers in foreign countries 
we expect that receivables with respect to foreign sales will continue to account for a portion of our total revenues 
as a result  our business in these markets is subject to a variety of risks  including recessions in foreign economies  the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions  expropriation  nationalization and limitation on repatriation of earnings  currency exchange fluctuations  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing foreign operations  alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  social  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  acts of war and terrorism  ability to finance foreign operations  changes in consumer tastes and trends  tariffs and other trade barriers  acts of war or terrorism  and us government requirements for export 
there can be no assurances that any of these international developments  or others  would not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 
our bank loan agreement imposes significant restrictions and failure to comply with these restrictions could result in the acceleration of a substantial portion of our debt  which we may not be able to repay or refinance 
our bank loan agreement contains a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and certain of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make other distributions  enter into certain acquisitions  repurchase equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  issue or sell equity interests of our subsidiaries  and engage in mergers or consolidations or certain other transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates 
in addition  the bank loan agreement requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios  including certain leverage ratios 
our ability to comply with such ratios  meet our debt service obligations or reduce our total debt is dependent upon our future performance  which may be affected by events beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with such restrictions and limitations  or that they will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs  or engage in other business activities that would otherwise be in the company s interest 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the bank loan agreement 
in the event of any such default  the lenders could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding under the bank loan agreement  together with any accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable  as well as require us to apply all available cash to repay the amounts 
if we were unable to repay the indebtedness upon its acceleration  the lenders could proceed against the underlying collateral 
there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay the amount in full  or that we would be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the indebtedness 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  virtually all of our debt is subject to variable interest rates  rising interest rates could negatively impact our business 
certain borrowings under our bank loan agreement bear interest at a variable rate 
in addition  we may incur other variable rate indebtedness in the future 
carrying indebtedness subject to variable interest rates makes the company more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns  as well as reduces our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 
increases in interest rates on this indebtedness would increase our interest expense  which could adversely affect our cash flow  our ability to service our debt and to generally grow the business 
current borrowings  as well as potential future financings  may substantially increase our current indebtedness 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to generate the cash flow necessary to permit us to meet our fixed charges and payment obligations with respect to our debt 
we could be required to incur additional indebtedness to meet these fixed charges and payment obligations 
should we incur additional debt  among other things  such increased indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to expand the business  market our products and make investments and capital expenditures  adversely affect the cost and availability of funds from commercial lenders  debt financing transactions and other sources  and create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with lower debt levels 
any inability of us to service our fixed charges and payment obligations  or incurrence of additional debt  would have an adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations and business generally 
an inability to maintain sufficient liquidity could negatively affect expected levels of operations and new product development 
future revenue may not be sufficient to meet operating  product development and other cash flow requirements 
sufficient funds to service our debt and maintain new product development efforts and expected levels of operations may not be available  and additional capital  if and when needed by us  may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms when needed  we may not be able to carry out our planned product development efforts and level of operations  which could harm our business 
our financial results vary from quarter to quarter  which could negatively impact our business 
various factors affect our quarterly operating results  some of which are not within our control 
these factors include  among others the financial strength of the gaming industry  consumer s willingness to spend money on leisure activities  the timing and introduction of new products and services  the mix of products and services sold  the timing of significant orders from and shipments to customers  alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  product and service pricing and discounts  the timing of acquisitions of other companies and businesses or dispositions  and general economic conditions 
these and other factors are likely to cause our financial results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
based on the foregoing  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful 
in addition  such fluctuations could cause us to be unable to comply with the financial ratios in our bank loan agreement 
certain market risks may affect our business  results of operations and prospects 
in the normal course of our business  we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements  collectibility of receivables and recoverability of residual values on leased assets 
further  some of our payors may experience financial difficulties  or may otherwise not pay accounts receivable when due  resulting in increased write offs 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurances can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future 
our strategic plan  involving growth through the acquisition of other companies  may not succeed 
our strategic plan involves  in part  growth through the acquisition of other companies 
such growth involves a number of risks  including the difficulties related to combining previously separate businesses  the substantial diversion of management s attention from day to day operations  the assumption of liabilities of an acquired business  including unforeseen liabilities  the failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  the dilution of existing stockholders due to the issuance of equity securities  utilization of cash reserves  or incurrence of debt in order to fund the acquisitions  the potentially substantial transaction costs associated with acquisitions  and the difficulties related to assimilating the products  personnel and systems of an acquired business and to integrating distribution and other operational capabilities 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan  which  together with provisions in our restated articles of incorporation and nevada law  could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in you receiving a premium over the market price for your common stock 
we adopted a shareholder rights plan pursuant to which we distributed one right for each outstanding share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of march  because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting a take over of us without the approval of our board of directors  even if such a change in control would result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock  without first negotiating with our board of directors 
additionally  our restated articles of incorporation permit our board of directors to issue special shares from time to time  with such rights and preferences as they consider appropriate 
our board alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  of directors could authorize the issuance of special shares with terms and conditions and under circumstances that could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction 
as a nevada corporation  we are also subject to certain provisions of the nevada general corporation law that have anti takeover effects and may inhibit a non negotiated merger or other business combination 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with  and to obtain the approval of  our board of directors in connection with such a transaction 
however  certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of the company  including an acquisition in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
as a result  stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency rate fluctuations revenues and results of operations derived from our non us subsidiaries are denominated in their local currencies and are affected by changes in the relative values of non us currencies and the non us dollar 
most of the currencies in countries in which we have foreign operations have strengthened versus the us dollar  which resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars 
the company does not currently utilize hedging instruments 
market risks during the normal course of our business  we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest and currency rate movements  collectibility of accounts and notes receivable  and recoverability of residual values on leased assets 
we constantly assess these risks and have established policies and practices designed to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurances can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis of our financial instruments  which consist of our cash and cash equivalents and debt 
we have no derivative financial instruments 
in performing the sensitivity analysis  we define risk of loss as the hypothetical impact of changes in the market interest rates or currency exchange rates on earnings 
the results of the sensitivity analysis at june  are as follows interest rate risk we had total debt of approximately million  consisting primarily of the million term loan under our senior credit facilities and the million subordinated loan and other debt at approximately million 
the interest rate for the term loan is reset every six months 
if the libor rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  with all other factors remaining constant  earnings would decrease or increase by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our foreign subsidiaries generally use their domestic currency as their functional currency 
a fluctuation in the exchange rates of these currencies against the us dollar would result in a corresponding change in earnings reported in the consolidated group of approximately million 
alliance gaming corporation form k year ended june  estimates our financial statements are prepared using estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates either favorably or unfavorably  which may impact future results
