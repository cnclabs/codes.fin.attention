item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview fiscal was a very successful year on multiple fronts for precision castparts corp pcc or the company 
spurred by the addition of sps technologies sps  which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal  and by vigorous growth in pcc s core aerospace and power generation markets  pcc delivered strong operating results and attained record levels in sales  operating income  net income and earnings per share from continuing operations 
the successful integration of sps was a significant contributor to the strong performance achieved in fiscal during the year  the acquired sps operations rapidly realized substantial synergies and operating margin improvement  and in the fourth quarter  the fastener operations of sps were bolstered by new opportunities from the acquisition of air industries corporation aic 
aic s significant market presence in structural airframe bolts and expertise in manufacturing titanium fastener products greatly expands the manufacturing capabilities and range of products that the fastener products segment can offer to its customers 
aic s fiscal operating results  which included only three weeks of activity in the fourth quarter  were immediately accretive to earnings 
in addition to the strong performance from the sps operations  leverage from improving market conditions and increased market shares  coupled with on going cost take outs throughout the company  helped pcc s pre sps acquisition base businesses achieve excellent operating results during the year  despite strong headwinds from higher raw material costs and contractual price reductions 
also during the year  the company divested substantially all of its non core pumps and valves businesses that were part of the now discontinued fluid management products segment  as well as certain non core businesses from the sps acquisition 
these divestitures  which generated million of cash  will enable the company to focus more attention and resources on its core markets and businesses 
the company also retired million of percent debt in the fourth quarter  which drove the debt to capitalization ratio from percent at the end of fiscal to percent at the end of fiscal with a strengthening credit profile  pcc is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities for growth in fiscal and beyond 
looking ahead to fiscal  the stage is set for another strong year 
not only will pcc benefit in fiscal from the recovery of oem build rates in both the aerospace and power generation markets  the company will also benefit from the impact of continuing strong aftermarket sales  market share gains and expansion of pcc s technologies into new markets 
pcc also expects to achieve continuing performance improvements from its operations throughout the year 
with these favorable conditions  the company anticipates that overall growth in sales and earnings during the upcoming year will out pace forecasted industry growth rates for the aerospace  power generation and automotive markets

a recovery in commercial aircraft deliveries  coupled with strong aftermarket sales and increased market share gains in the aerospace and power generation markets led to increased sales in the investment cast products and forged products segments 
according to jsa research as of october  commercial aircraft deliveries were forecasted to increase approximately percent in calendar year from calendar year compared with declining deliveries since calendar year because of manufacturing lead times precision castparts corp 
subsidiaries required to support aircraft deliveries  pcc began realizing these calendar forecasted increases during its fiscal in addition  continued growth in the seamless pipe market in the forged products segment  and expansion of the company s metal injection molding technology in the automotive sector and strength in the pulp and paper market contributed to higher sales in the industrial products segment 
cost of goods sold was  million  or percent of sales  in fiscal as compared to  million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the flat year over year percentage reflects the impact of leverage from higher sales volume and improved operating efficiencies  offset by increased raw material costs and lower sales prices in fiscal selling and administrative expenses were million  or percent of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the flat year over year percentage was due to a full year of sps results  which has higher sg a as a percent of sales than pcc s base businesses  offset by the leverage from higher sales volume 
net income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per share diluted  which included restructuring and asset impairment charges totaling per share diluted 
by comparison  net income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per share diluted  which included restructuring and impairment charges totaling per share diluted  and other expense associated with financing the sps acquisition of per share 
fiscal net loss after discontinued operations was million  or a net loss of per share diluted  compared with net income of million  or per share diluted in fiscal the fiscal net loss includes charges totaling million  or per share diluted  related to the disposition of the pumps and valves businesses 
business acquisitions on march   pcc acquired percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of air industries corporation aic for million paid in cash 
aic is a leading manufacturer of airframe fasteners  which include bolts  pins  and screws made from titanium and nickel based alloys 
this acquisition is expected to significantly enhance pcc s presence in the aerospace fastener market by expanding the range of fastener products offered to pcc s aerospace customers 
aic will operate as part of the fastener products segment 
on december   pcc acquired percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of sps technologies  inc sps was acquired to strengthen and build upon the company s core businesses  technologies and customer relationships 
in addition  sps complementary manufacturing processes provide the company with opportunities to enhance efficiencies and reduce costs 
the aggregate purchase price was million  which included million of cash  pcc common stock valued at million and million of cash paid for transaction fees 
in addition  sps paid million for change of control payments and transaction fees as of the close of the transaction 
the value of the million shares of pcc common stock issued in connection with the acquisition was determined based on the quoted market price of pcc s common stock on and around the date of the close of the transaction 
sps is a supplier of fasteners and other metal products to the aerospace  automotive  and general industrial markets 
sps former specialty materials and alloys group now operates as part of the investment cast products segment 
a new segment  fastener products  was established and comprises sps former aerospace fasteners and engineered fasteners groups 
sps former tool group now operates as part of the industrial products segment 
in addition  three former sps businesses dacar  which was sold in the third quarter of fiscal  magnetics  which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal and mohawk  which was sold subsequent to the end of fiscal were classified as held for sale in the third quarter of fiscal  and their results were included in discontinued operations until their disposition 
discontinued operations the company s financial statements were significantly impacted by activities relating to the planned divestiture of a number of pcc s businesses 
these businesses have been accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  any operating results of these businesses are presented in the company s consolidated statements of income as discontinued operations  net of income tax  and all prior periods have been reclassified 
fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  the company decided to sell all of the pumps and valves businesses of pcc flow technologies  with the exception of e one 
the businesses held for sale were reclassified from the fluid management products segment to discontinued operations 
the e one business was retained and is now included in the industrial products segment 
all of the pumps and valves businesses  with the exception of pcc eurovalves  were sold in the third quarter of fiscal pcc eurovalves  which is located in the netherlands  continues to be marketed 
pcc s decision to sell the pumps and valves businesses in the second quarter of fiscal resulted in a charge of million  of which million was associated with the write down of goodwill 
the remainder related to the write down of inventory  other amortizable assets and machinery and equipment to fair value less cost to sell 
approximately million of the charge was non cash 
subsequent to the second quarter  the company recorded additional write downs related to the disposition of the pumps and valves businesses  bringing the total net loss on disposal to million 
fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  three businesses acquired in the sps transaction magnetics  mohawk  and dacar were classified as held for sale and their results were included in discontinued operations 
they were classified as discontinued operations because they were deemed to be non core to the company 
dacar was sold in the third quarter of fiscal  magnetics was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and mohawk was sold in april  subsequent to fiscal year end 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company incurred asset impairment and disposal charges associated with its decision to sell newmans  a valve distribution company of pcc flow technologies 
it was determined that newmans distribution business did not fit with pcc s manufacturing focused operations and was not performing to the company s expectations 
the company s decision to sell newmans resulted in a charge of million  principally related to the write down of assets to net realizable value 
the newmans business was sold in the third quarter of fiscal precision castparts corp 
subsidiaries fiscal in fiscal  pcc incurred charges associated with the closure or sale of certain businesses of the industrial products segment and pcc flow technologies 
within the industrial products segment  the pcc olofsson and eldorado machine businesses were closed and the eldorado gundrill tooling business was sold 
in addition  the company sold its controlling interest in design technologies international dti and certain intangible assets of olofsson to minority shareholders of dti 
the closure or sale of these operations was in response to a steady and continual decline in the machine tool industry 
in addition  pcc closed stw composites stw as it was deemed to be a non core business to pcc 
pcc also entered into an agreement to sell fastener engineers lewis machine felm and began actively marketing pcc superior fabrication for sale in the fourth quarter 
felm was sold during the first quarter and pcc superior fabrication was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal within pcc flow technologies  the company began marketing barber industries in the fourth quarter of fiscal and sold the business in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recorded disposal expenses in fiscal totaling million related to the write down of remaining inventory and property  plant and equipment to fair value less cost to sell  the write down of accounts receivable and other current assets to net realizable value  and incremental costs directly related to the closure or sale of the businesses  such as pension  severance and lease termination costs 
restructuring  asset impairment and other non recurring charges the following table provides significant components of amounts recorded in the consolidated statements of income related to the company s restructuring and asset impairment charges 
fiscal provision for restructuring severance other impairment of long lived assets total the following table provides a rollforward of amounts included in accrued liabilities for restructuring reserves fiscal restructuring reserve at beginning of period provision continuing operations cash payments non cash adjustments restructuring reserve at end of period during the fourth quarter of fiscal  pcc recorded provisions for restructuring and impairment of long lived assets totaling million  principally related to additional costs associated with a business that was closed several years ago 
the tax effected impact of these charges was million  or per share diluted 
taking into consideration current and forecasted conditions in markets served by the company  pcc regularly assesses its cost structure to ensure that operations are properly sized for prevailing market conditions 
based on the company s most recent assessment  there are no current plans to restructure operations in fiscal other expense income other expense of million was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal to reflect the write off of unamortized bank fees million from early termination of bank credit facilities and the termination of an interest rate swap million associated with debt refinancing  both in connection with the sps acquisition 
outlook the company expects that the aerospace and power generation markets will continue to strengthen in fiscal as aircraft build rates increase and industrial gas turbine businesses recover  coupled with continued market share gains and strong demand in china for seamless pipe 
continued market share gains and expansion of pcc s technologies in the automotive market will also improve sales in fiscal  while other markets served by the company are expected to be relatively flat  or slightly improved from fiscal overall  sales are expected to grow by approximately percent from fiscal the company anticipates its overall growth in fiscal will exceed forecasted industry oem build rates for the aerospace  power generation and automotive markets as a result of increased aftermarket business  continued market share gains and expansion of pcc s technologies into new markets 
operating margins  as a percent of sales  are expected to show modest improvement over fiscal levels principally due to leverage from higher sales volume and improved operating performance  tempered somewhat by the impact of expected increases in zero margin pass through of higher metal costs 
financial results by segment pcc has organized the company s business segments along its four major product lines and reports financial results in the following four segments investment cast products  forged products  fastener products and industrial products

fiscal sales increased percent from the prior year s sales of  million  and operating income increased by percent over the prior year s operating income of million  or percent of sales 
the smag businesses contributed a full year of results in fiscal compared to weeks in fiscal the increase in sales of the base businesses was driven by continued recovery in the power generation and aerospace markets  with solid aftermarket growth as well as market share gains 
the increase in operating income principally reflected the impact of the higher sales volume and operating improvements  partially offset by lower selling prices and higher raw material costs  mainly nickel and cobalt  which have increased approximately percent and percent  respectively  on the london metal exchange lme and metal bulletin cofm 
index bloomberg compared to fiscal the improvement in operating margins as a percentage of sales was mainly due to the leverage from the higher sales volume and improved manufacturing performance  partially offset by the impact of lower selling prices  higher raw material costs and pass through pricing 
the investment cast products segment anticipates higher sales associated with the aerospace and power generation markets in fiscal operating margins  as a percent of sales  are expected to improve in fiscal as a result of leverage from the higher sales volume and continued improvements in operating efficiencies  partially offset by the impact of pass through pricing 
fiscal compared with fiscal the investment cast products segment reported fiscal sales of  million and operating income of million  or percent of sales 
fiscal sales decreased percent from the prior year s  million  and operating income decreased by percent over the prior year s million  or percent of sales 
the addition of sps smag businesses in december contributed million of sales and million of operating income  or percent of sales  to fiscal results 
the overall sales decline compared to fiscal was due to continued weakness in both the aerospace and power generation markets  combined with the impact of price reductions 
despite the sales decline and higher raw material costs compared to fiscal  the investment cast products segment was able to achieve solid operating margins due to continued aggressive cost takeout throughout its operations and improvements in manufacturing performance 
forged products the forged products segment consists of the forging operations of wyman gordon 
forged products sales to the aerospace and power generation markets are derived primarily from the same large engine customers served by the investment cast products segment  with additional aerospace sales going to manufacturers of landing gear and other airframe components 
the forged products segment also produces seamless pipe for the power generation and the oil and gas industries

fiscal sales increased percent from the prior year s sales of million  and operating income increased by percent over the prior year s operating income of million  or percent of sales 
the increase in sales includes approximately million of higher prices related to pass through of increased nickel costs 
the volume increase was due to heavy demand for aerospace components as well as continued demand for seamless pipe to the power generation market in china 
operating income as a percent of sales benefited in the current year from the higher volume  but was lower than last year due to higher material costs  mainly nickel and titanium  which have increased approximately percent and percent  respectively  on the lme bloomberg and ti bulk weldables index metalprices 
com since fiscal sales in fiscal within this segment are expected to benefit from continued growth in the aerospace market and continued growth in extruded pipe sales  as well as recovery in the industrial gas turbine market 
operating income is expected to benefit from the higher sales volume and the favorable impact of contract terms that allow for pass through pricing of higher material costs 
while these recoveries will increase segment revenues and protect precision castparts corp 
subsidiaries operating income  they will have a dampening effect on related improvements in operating income as a percentage of sales 
fiscal compared with fiscal the forged products segment reported sales of million for fiscal  a decrease of million  with operating income of million  or percent of sales  a decrease of million from the fiscal level of million  or percent of sales 
the sales decline was due to reduced demand for commercial aerospace products as well as products for the power generation market  partially offset by increased demand for military aerospace products 
operating margins within this segment are significantly impacted by the deleveraging effect of the sales decline due to the capital intensive nature of the forging business 
higher raw material costs  as well as price concessions  also reduced operating margins 
cost reductions and benefits from settlement of a supply agreement between wyman gordon and timet helped to partially offset the impact of these items 
fastener products the fastener products segment includes sps former aerospace fasteners and engineered fasteners groups that were acquired in december the businesses that comprise this segment produce fasteners  fastener systems and components for critical applications in the aerospace  automotive and industrial machinery markets

see the pension and other postretirement benefit plans footnote to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to pcc s business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on pcc s business operations are discussed throughout the management s discussion and analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
note that the preparation of this annual report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer  precision castparts corp 
subsidiaries collectibility is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed and determinable 
in instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment  the company recognizes revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing aftermarket repair and maintenance and engineering activities  are recognized as services are performed 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue 
accounts receivable reserve the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where pcc is aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount the company reasonably expects will be collected 
in addition  the company records reserves for bad debts based on other quantitative measures  which include the analysis of historical write offs and the age of outstanding receivables 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
although the company considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates could have a material effect on the required reserve balances 
valuation of inventories all inventories are stated at the lower of the cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
cost for work in process and metal inventories at a significant number of the company s operations is determined on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
therefore  although management makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecast demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of pcc s inventories and reported operating results 
goodwill and acquired intangibles from time to time  the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for our fiscal year beginning april  the company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb finalized sfas no 
revised r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements  with the cost measured based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas no 
r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition  which may be back to the original issuance of sfas no 
or in the year of adoption 
the effective date of sfas no 
r is the first quarter of the first fiscal year beginning after june   which is pcc s first quarter of fiscal pcc is currently evaluating these transition methods and the methodology to be used when adopting this statement 
see stock based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp and fsp 
fsp provides guidance on the application of sfas  accounting for income taxes  with regard to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provision within hr the american jobs creation act of act that was enacted on october  fsp provides guidance on a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to qualifying us taxpayers 
the act contains numerous provisions related to corporate and international taxation including repeal of the extraterritorial income eti regime  creation of a new domestic production activities dpa deduction and a temporary dividends received deduction related to repatriation of foreign earnings 
the act contains various effective dates and transition periods related to its provisions 
under the guidance provided in fsp the new dpa deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in sfas as such  the special deduction has no effect on the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our income tax return 
the repeal of eti is transitioned in  effective with sales after january  the impact of this change was not material on our effective income tax rate for fiscal the replacement with a dpa deduction was not in effect for pcc fiscal year ended april  and therefore  did not affect our income tax provision for the year ended april  we do not expect the net effect of the phase out of the eti deduction and phase in of the new dpa deduction to result in a material impact on our effective income tax rate in fiscal under the guidance provided by fsp  the financial accounting standards board acknowledged that  due to the proximity of the act s enactment date to many companies year ends and the fact that numerous provisions within the act are complex and pending further regulatory guidance  many companies may not be in a position to assess the impact of the act on their plans for repatriation or reinvestment of foreign earnings 
therefore  the fsp provided companies with a practical exception to the permanent reinvestment standards of sfas and apb no 
by providing additional time to determine the amount of earnings  if any  that they intend to repatriate under the act s provisions 
the company is not yet in a position to decide whether  and to what extent  foreign earnings may be repatriated to the us therefore  under the guidance provided in fsp  no deferred tax liability has been recorded in connection with the repatriation provisions of precision castparts corp 
subsidiaries the act 
we are currently analyzing the impact of the temporary dividends received deduction provisions contained in the act 
forward looking statements information included within this form k describing the projected growth and future results and events constitutes forward looking statements  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results in future periods may differ materially from the forward looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to fluctuations in the aerospace  power generation  automotive  and other general industrial cycles  the relative success of the company s entry into new markets  competitive pricing  the financial viability of the company s significant customers  the availability and cost of energy  materials  supplies  and insurance  the cost of pension and postretirement medical benefits  equipment failures  relations with the company s employees  the company s ability to manage its operating costs and to integrate acquired businesses in an effective manner  governmental regulations and environmental matters  risks associated with international operations and world economies  the relative stability of certain foreign currencies  and implementation of new technologies and process improvements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at various times  the company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and prices of strategic raw materials 
fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge 
because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes  they do not represent incremental risk to the company 
for further discussion of derivative financial instruments  refer to the summary of significant accounting policies  fair value of financial instruments and financing arrangements sections in item notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company has variable rate debt obligations that expose the company to interest rate risk 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company terminated an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate on a portion of the outstanding borrowings under its terminated bank credit facility 
if market interest rates had averaged percent higher than actual levels in fiscal or  the effect on the company s interest expense and net income  after considering the effects of the interest rate swap contracts and interest rate cap  would not have been material 
foreign currency risk the majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars  however  the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies for transactions denominated in other currencies 
as discussed in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company had foreign currency hedges in place at april  and march  to reduce such exposure 
the potential loss in fair value on such financial instruments from a hypothetical percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have been material to the financial position of the company as of the end of fiscal or fiscal material cost risk as discussed in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company had entered into long term supply agreements to fix the purchase price of strategic raw materials at april  and march  in addition  pcc had escalation clauses related to raw material pricing in certain of the company s contracts at april  and march  if market rates had averaged percent higher than actual levels in either fiscal or  the effect on the company s cost of sales and net earnings  after considering the effects of these agreements and contracts  would not have been material
