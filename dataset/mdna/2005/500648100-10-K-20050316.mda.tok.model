item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview kos is a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the development and commercialization of proprietary prescription products for the treatment of chronic cardiovascular  metabolic and respiratory diseases 
kos manufactures its lead products  niaspan and advicor  and currently markets them directly through its own specialty sales force and co promotion partner in the us and through its commercialization partner and license arrangements outside of the us  canada and japan 
on march   the company announced that it had entered into a product acquisition agreement with aventis pharmaceuticals holdings inc the azmacort acquisition agreement and a finished product supply agreement the azmacort supply agreement and together with the azmacort acquisition agreement  the aventis agreements with aventis pharmaceuticals inc collectively with aventis pharmaceuticals holdings inc  aventis to acquire global rights to the azmacort triamcinolone acetonide inhalation aerosol franchise 
the transaction was completed on march  accordingly  kos began recording revenue for all sales related to the azmacort product beginning april  the company s cardiovascular and metabolic products under development consist of controlled release  oral solid dosage formulations  and the company s respiratory and metabolic products under development consist of aerosolized inhalation formulations to be used primarily with kos proprietary inhalation devices 
the company s current core business strategy is based upon developing drugs that are reformulations of existing approved prescription pharmaceutical products  but which offer certain safety or patient compliance advantages compared with existing formulations of such products 
the principal elements of kos current business strategy are as follows i develop or acquire products with unrealized commercial potential where safety or patient compliance may be improved or where greater utilization of a product could be attained through increasing the awareness of the product s features and benefits  ii focus on the large  rapidly growing cardiovascular  metabolic and respiratory markets  which include many chronic diseases requiring long term therapy  iii develop proprietary formulations of currently approved pharmaceutical compounds  iv manage internally the clinical development of its products  v manufacture its products internally  or where necessary or prudent  using a contract manufacturer  vi market its products directly through the company s sales forces  which kos may supplement with a contract sales organization or other partners and through co promotion and other strategic alliances to extend the marketing reach of the company to new and existing patients  and vii leverage its core competencies through corporate and academic alliances 
in measuring the company s results of operations  management s primary focus is on revenue growth of the niaspan  advicor  and azmacort products  as well as net income growth 
net sales of the company s niaspan and advicor products increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase in niaspan and advicor 
table of contents revenue was primarily attributable to increases in unit volume and prices for the company s products during the period  partially offset by the impact of a change in product return estimates as described below in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the first quarter of as mentioned above  the company began recording azmacort revenue on april  azmacort revenue through december  totaled million 
net income for the year ended december   was million compared to net income of million for the same period in the increase  in part  was also attributable to a net benefit from income taxes of million  principally related to the reversal of the majority of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance and to the deferred income tax benefit associated with a million charge related to the aventis transaction  as more fully described below 
the increase in net income was partially offset by the write off  as a research and development expense  of approximately million for the value of in process research and development associated with the assets acquired from aventis  as more fully described below 
because kos current core business strategy is mostly dependent on the reformulation of existing compounds or the development or acquisition of products with unrealized market potential  the company s business could be subject to significant competitive pressures by other products and therapies in the rapidly growing markets for cardiovascular  metabolic and respiratory treatments 
as such  kos critical success factors include its ability to continue to increase the amount of revenue generated by the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products  and its ability to successfully develop and or acquire new products or drugs 
the company s ability to continue to increase revenue is primarily dependent on its ability to increase prescriptions for its marketed products  and to maintain a competitive product pricing and differentiation strategy 
the company s ability to complete new drug and product acquisitions on favorable terms will be a critical factor in the company s ability to increase revenues in future periods 
protection of the company s intellectual property rights will also be critical to the company s success in future periods  including its ability to obtain and maintain patents  enforce those patents  preserve trade secrets  and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
general a predecessor corporation to the company was formed in july under the name of kos pharmaceuticals  inc principally to conduct research and development on new formulations of existing prescription pharmaceutical products 
in june  aeropharm technology  inc  now aeropharm technology  llc aeropharm  a then majority owned subsidiary of the company  was formed to conduct research and development activities on aerosolized products  dispensed in metered dosed inhalers  for the treatment of respiratory diseases 
during june  this predecessor corporation acquired the outstanding minority interest in aeropharm  changed its name to kos holdings  inc holdings  established the company as a wholly owned subsidiary under the name of kos pharmaceuticals  inc  and  effective as of june   transferred all of its existing assets  liabilities  and intellectual property  other than certain net operating loss carryforwards  to the company 
accordingly  all references in this form k filing to the company s business include the business and operations of holdings until june  on march   the company completed an initial public offering ipo of its common stock 
from inception through the ipo  the company had not recorded any significant revenues  and the company had funded its operations exclusively through equity contributions and loans from its majority shareholder 
through december   the company had accumulated a net deficit from operations of approximately million 
in connection with the transfer of operations from holdings to the company on june   net operating loss carryforwards amounting to approximately million and related tax benefits were retained by holdings and not transferred to the company 
as of december   the 
table of contents company had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards and million of tax credits 
on july   kos received clearance from the food and drug administration fda to market the niaspan product for the treatment of mixed lipid disorders 
niaspan is the only once a day prescription formulation of a niacin product approved by the fda for the treatment of mixed lipid disorders 
the company and its co promotion partner  takeda pharmaceuticals north america  inc takeda  currently market niaspan in the united states directly to physicians who specialize in treating patients with coronary heart disease and or who are among the leading prescribers of lipid altering medications 
on december   kos received clearance from the fda to market the advicor product extended release niacin lovastatin tablets 
the approval of the advicor product marked the first time that the fda has approved a combination product for the safe and efficacious treatment of cholesterol disorders 
the company began detailing the advicor product to physicians on january  as with niaspan  kos and takeda market advicor directly to physicians who specialize in treating patients with coronary heart disease and or who are among the leading prescribers of lipid altering medications 
on march   the company completed the acquisition of the azmacort product from aventis 
the azmacort product is an inhaled corticosteroid that alleviates inflammation in the lungs and is used as prophylactic therapy for the maintenance treatment of asthma 
under the terms of the aventis agreements  kos paid aventis approximately million in cash and has agreed to pay a royalty on future sales of a hydrofluoroalkane hfa version of the product in development 
under the terms of the azmacort supply agreement  aventis has agreed to supply finished product to kos for a period of five years from the date of the azmacort acquisition 
the purchase price allocation resulted in the recording of intangible assets of million for developed and core technology value  million for the value of certain other intangibles  million for the value of inventory  and million for the value of in process research and development 
the million value assigned to in process research and development of the acquired assets was recorded as a research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the in process r d write off 
the in process r d write off resulted in the company also recording a million deferred tax benefit to account for the difference between the book and tax basis of accounting for this write off 
the remaining intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives  ranging from five to years 
the company began detailing the azmacort product in august and currently markets the azmacort product in the united states directly to specialist physicians  such as pulmonologists and allergists 
the in process r d write off was determined by identifying the specific in process research and development projects that would be continued and for which a technological feasibility has not been established as of the acquisition date  b there was no alternative future use  and c the fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability 
the acquired in process research and development represents a single project  the hfa formulation of azmacort 
the hfa formulation of azmacort does not use a chlorofluorocarbon cfc based propellant and  consequently  does not deplete the ozone layer 
the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer the protocol is an international treaty under which the production and consumption of ozone depleting substances is being phased out worldwide 
under the protocol  codified by the us congress into law in title vi of the clean air act  the production of cfcs in the us was banned as of january   unless a specific exemption is approved annually by the international parties to the protocol 
in order to comply with the clean air act and the montreal protocol  the us will eventually need to phase out cfc propelled metered dose inhalers 

table of contents the azmacort hfa formulation had not achieved technological feasibility as of the transaction date 
among the technological matters to be resolved are manufacturing controls and evidence of dose proportionality between the g and g formulations 
the company believes it may have to invest up to million during the period to achieve technological feasibility of the azmacort hfa formulation 
if the technological and regulatory challenges are overcome  sales of the azmacort hfa formulation could begin as early as the fair value of all of the in process research and development was determined using the income approach 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with the in process technology 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams  some of which are more certain than others 
the risk adjusted discount rate utilized in calculating the fair value of the azmacort hfa formulation was

results of operations critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the company believes that its most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  the estimation of allowances principally related to product returns and discounts  managed care rebates  chargebacks  and reimbursements relating to medicaid and medicare  accounting for income taxes  and management s estimate of the useful lives and realizability of recorded intangible assets 
the company records accrual estimates for sales returns and allowances mostly based on historical experience 
the calculation of rebates and chargebacks is based on existing contractual arrangements with indirect customers such as managed care providers  pharmacy benefit administrators  and government units and on kos analysis of estimated product inventory levels in its distribution channel  which is derived through the use of certain inputs 
the company believes that its estimation of sales allowances related to product returns and discounts  managed care rebates  chargebacks  and reimbursements associated with medicaid and medicare represent the best estimates of those amounts  and are based on assumptions which the company believes represent the most likely outcomes 
the most pertinent inputs used in the estimation of the company sales allowances and accruals  and product inventory levels in its distribution channel  include prescription data derived from a third party publication  consumer price index derived from a third party publication  product best price derived from the company s contractual arrangements  and average manufacturer price amp computational in nature using historical data 
of these inputs  prescription data and amp require significant estimation 
the company believes that variances between estimates and actual results of prescription data and amp may reasonably vary between and  respectively 
the following table reflects the potential impact to revenue for the year ended december   based upon various combinations of these reasonably likely outcomes in prescription data and amp estimates positive dollar amounts represent potential decreases in revenue  negative dollar amounts represent potential increases in revenue 
table of contents impact on niaspan  advicor and azmacort revenue sensitivity analysis of possible variations in prescription and amp inputs in millions  except variance prescription variance amp variance the company s management periodically reviews the policies and estimates discussed above  the effect of which is reflected as a component of net income in the period in which a change is known 
other than the changes described below associated with the company s estimate of its product return exposure during the first quarter of  and the adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a result of the change in judgment about the realizability of such asset  such changes to these estimates have not been material to the company s results of operations during the years ended december   and the company periodically evaluates the volume of its niaspan  advicor  and azmacort products that are in customer inventories or elsewhere in the distribution channel to determine whether increased risk of product returns exists 
for the period from the introduction of its internally developed products through december   kos return risk expectations were consistently based on its limited product return experience given the early stage nature of its products and of the company 
accordingly  kos established a specific return risk estimate based on estimated inventory levels in the distribution channel that was used to determine the amount of revenue that could be recorded during a given period 
during the quarter ended march   as a result of the significant history of minimal returns for the niaspan and advicor products since their introduction  kos revised its return risk estimates to reflect the historically low product return patterns 
this change in accounting estimate resulted in the company recognizing as revenue all product shipments made during the quarter ended march   as well as million of prior period product shipments not recognized as revenue because of kos previous product return risk exposure estimates 
the impact of this change in estimate increased the company s reported revenues  net income  and basic and diluted earnings per share by million  million  and per share and per share  respectively  for the year ended december  the company will continue to monitor wholesaler inventory levels  and  if the company s product return risk exceeds acceptable levels  the company may be required to not recognize the revenue and related costs associated with the excess inventory until such return risk is mitigated 
the company follows statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires  among other things  recognition of future tax benefits and liabilities measured at enacted tax rates attributable to temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that realization of said benefits is more likely than not 
through december   the company had established a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets because there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that the company would more 
table of contents likely than not realize all or a portion of such assets 
management currently believes  based on the company s historical profitability and on its expected future profitability  that the company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets prior to the expiration of any net operating loss carryforwards nols and  therefore  that the company will more likely than not realize most of its deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company had deferred tax assets of approximately million and a remaining valuation allowance of approximately million principally related to certain state nols which may not be realized the company  which resulted in net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
under sfas  the valuation allowance should be adjusted when a change in circumstances causes a change in judgment about the realizabilty of deferred tax assets 
the portion of the valuation allowance related to nols expected to be utilized to offset estimated ordinary income in the current year is included in the computation of the estimated annual effective tax rate 
the portion of the valuation allowance related to other deferred tax assets  including net operating losses expected to be utilized to offset ordinary income in future years  is reversed as of the date of the change in circumstances 
accordingly  the benefit from income taxes in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   includes the reversal of million of valuation allowance  of which million represents the portion reversed through the effective tax rate for the period and million relates to the reversal of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets expected to be realized through ordinary income in future years 
the benefit for income taxes also includes a million deferred benefit related to the in process r d write off 
included in the company s million of net deferred tax assets as of december   were million of federal nols available to offset future federal taxable income and million of state nols available to offset future state taxable income 
in addition  the company had million of other tax credits to offset future federal income tax 
if kos is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income through operating results  or if its estimates about future profitability change significantly  increases or decreases to the valuation allowance will be required through adjustments to income

the company believes that on or prior to the maturity date  it will have sufficient cash  available credit  and access to capital from third parties to be able to repay the standby facility on a timely basis in the event that mrs 
jaharis does not elect to exercise all or a portion of the remaining non detachable warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
however  the company believes that  if the market price of the company s common stock continues to significantly exceed the warrant exercise price established under the standby facility  which is per share  through the end of the warrant exercise period  mrs 
jaharis will elect to exercise the warrants available under this facility into shares of kos common stock prior to the end of the warrant exercise period  thereby relieving the company of the obligation to repay such facility 
if such warrant exercise were not to take place for any reason  the company would be required to utilize its cash flow from operations and its then remaining borrowing capacity under its other facility with mrs 
jaharis  if such borrowing capacity is available at all  to repay borrowings due under the standby facility 

table of contents the company recorded million and million of interest expense for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to its credit facilities with mr 
jaharis and his transferees 
in january  the securities and exchange commission declared effective a shelf registration statement the shelf registration filed by the company for the sale  from time to time  of up to million of its common stock  preferred stock  stock options  warrants and other rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock 
on october   the company filed a new shelf registration statement that covered the shares of the earlier shelf registration the amended shelf registration and which allowed the limited partnership to sell up to  shares of the company s common stock in a public offering  and on october   the company further amended the amended shelf registration to register an aggregate of  shares of company common stock held by bms and the company s chairman 
the amended shelf registration was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on october  on november   the company sold  shares of common stock and the limited partnership sold  shares of common stock converted from the supplemental credit facility pursuant to the amended shelf registration 
on december   the company sold an additional  shares of common stock and the company s chairman sold  shares of common stock to cover over allotments as permitted in the amended shelf registration 
net proceeds to the company resulting from the sale of the  shares of common stock totaled million 
proceeds from the offerings  other than the proceeds pertaining to the selling shareholders  were mostly used to finance the purchase of the azmacort product from aventis 
although the company currently anticipates that  including the capital available to the company under the additional standby facility through june  and the standby facility through june   it has or has access to an amount of working capital that will be sufficient to fund the company s operations for the next twelve months  the company s cash requirements during this period will be substantial and may exceed the amount of working capital available to the company 
the company s ability to fund its operating requirements and maintain an adequate level of working capital will depend primarily on its ability to continue to generate substantial growth in sales of its niaspan  advicor and azmacort products  its ability to continue to access its credit facilities  its ability to control operating expenses and on its ability to maintain the protection afforded by its patents 
the company s failure to generate substantial growth in the sales of niaspan  advicor and azmacort  control operating expenses  or meet the conditions necessary for the company to obtain funding under the additional standby facility and the standby facility  and other events including the progress of the company s research and development programs  the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals of the company s products under development  the company s ability to obtain regulatory approvals in the united states and abroad  the company s ability to maintain its compliance with fda regulations and standards without adversely affecting its manufacturing capability or ability to meet its production requirements or profit margins  the company s ability to manufacture products at an economically feasible cost  costs in filing  prosecuting  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the outcome of lawsuits involving the company s intellectual property  the extent and terms of any collaborative research  manufacturing  marketing  joint venture  or other arrangements  and changes in economic  regulatory  or competitive conditions or the company s planned business could cause the company to require additional capital 
in the event that the company must raise additional capital to fund its working capital needs  it may seek to raise such capital through loans  the issuance of debt securities or equity securities  each of which would require the consent of the company s current lender 
to the extent the company raises additional capital by issuing equity securities or obtaining borrowings convertible into equity  ownership dilution to existing shareholders will result  and future investors may be granted rights superior to those of existing shareholders 
moreover  additional capital may not be available to the company on acceptable terms  or at all

subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or to persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
market acceptance and sales growth of niaspan and advicor the company s success depends in part upon its ability to successfully market and sell increasing quantities of the niaspan and advicor products 
the company s ability to successfully sell increasing quantities of the niaspan and advicor products will depend significantly on the continued acceptance of the niaspan product by physicians and their patients despite the commercialization of advicor 
as a consequence of the on going commercialization of the advicor product  which is a combination product including niaspan and lovastatin  a statin class compound  prescription levels for niaspan may be adversely affected to the extent a significant number of physicians prescribe advicor as a substitute product for their patients who are currently taking niaspan 
such substitution could have an adverse effect on the growth of the combined revenue generated from the sale of the company s products 
further  there are numerous versions of niacin currently available as a dietary supplement 
the company s ability to successfully sell increasing quantities of the niaspan and advicor products may be affected by the substitution of niacin dietary supplements for its products 
sales could also be affected by competition from the sale of other statin products and other cardiovascular therapies 
the company believes that intolerable flushing and potential liver toxicity associated with other currently available dietary supplement formulations of niacin are the principal reasons why physicians generally have been reluctant to prescribe or recommend such formulations 
flushing episodes are often characterized by facial redness  tingling or rash  and are a side effect that often occurs when humans ingest niacin 
currently available formulations of niacin generally either require  in the case of immediate release niacin  the patient to take niacin several times per day and at high dosages  resulting in multiple flushing episodes  or result  in the case of sustained release niacin  in liver toxicity 
although most patients taking the niaspan and advicor products will sometimes flush  the formulation and dosing regimen for niaspan and advicor have been designed to maximize patient acceptance and minimize the occurrence of flushing and liver toxicity 
if  however  a significant number of patients using the niaspan and advicor products were to suffer episodes of flushing that they consider intolerable or to suffer other side effects  physicians may discontinue prescribing the niaspan and advicor products or patients may stop taking niaspan and advicor  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning the niaspan or advicor products or any other product incorporating technology similar to that used in the niaspan or advicor products also could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to maintain and or obtain regulatory approvals or to achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians  managed care providers  or patients  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
on january   the company began commercializing the advicor product 
the company s ability to successfully sell increasing quantities of the advicor product will depend significantly on the increasing acceptance of the advicor product by physicians and their patients 
if a significant number of patients using the advicor product were to suffer episodes of flushing that they consider intolerable or to suffer more serious side effects  such as rhabdomyolysis or myopathy  physicians may discontinue prescribing the advicor product or patients may stop taking advicor  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
rhabdomyolysis is a rare disease in which serious muscle damage results in release of muscle cell contents into the bloodstream  which may be fatal 
myopathy is a disorder of muscle tissue or muscles that can result from endocrine disorders  metabolic disorders  infection or inflammation of the muscles  and from certain drugs 
there have been several cases where niaspan one of the principal ingredients in advicor or advicor have been identified as possible causes of myopathy 
unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning the advicor product or any other product 
table of contents incorporating technology similar to that used in the advicor product also could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to maintain regulatory approvals or to achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians  managed care providers  or patients  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  advicor may prove to be difficult to successfully sell beyond current levels because the market for cholesterol therapies is dominated by competitors with significantly larger sales forces and with significantly greater marketing resources than those available to the company 
further  advicor is a combination of two well known cholesterol drugs  niacin and lovastatin  that have been available for a significant period of time 
although the combination of these drugs is highly effective in improving all of the major components of cholesterol  it is possible that physicians may not prescribe advicor because it is not as new as more recently introduced compounds  such as the potent statin products marketed by the company s competitors 
also  because advicor is a combination of two currently available drugs  advicor has been approved by the fda for the improvement of cholesterol disorders in patients who were not able to achieve desired cholesterol improvements by taking either niaspan or lovastatin alone 
consequently  although such an approved treatment indication is standard for combination drugs such as advicor  it is possible that physicians will not prescribe advicor until they have first prescribed either niaspan  lovastatin  or another statin alone and subsequently determined that their patients need advicor to achieve desired cholesterol improvements 
similarly the company s ability to successfully sell increasing quantities of the advicor product may be adversely affected by  among other things  the november release of zetia  part of a new class of cholesterol lowering agents  by the september release of crestor  a new  highly powerful statin product  or by the august introduction of vytorin  a new  dual component therapy possessing significant potency with respect to reducing ldl cholesterol 
although zetia  crestor and vytorin possess limited potency with respect to increasing hdl cholesterol  the increased focus of the medical community in treating ldl cholesterol could adversely affect the utilization of the company s products  in which the differentiated feature is modulating other lipid risk factors that have been implicated in heart disease  but are not as well established as ldl cholesterol in contributing to coronary heart disease 
zetia and vytorin are being marketed by merck schering plough pharmaceuticals  which is a joint venture between merck co  inc and schering plough corporation  and crestor is marketed by astrazeneca 
merck schering plough pharmaceuticals and astrazeneca are competitors with substantially greater resources than kos 
zetia is part of a new class of cholesterol lowering agents that inhibit the intestinal absorption of cholesterol 
zetia is highly effective in reducing ldl cholesterol  but it has minimal effect in reducing hdl cholesterol 
crestor is a type of statin drug that is highly effective in reducing ldl cholesterol  but is less effective in modifying hdl cholesterol  triglycerides and other forms of cholesterol 
vytorin is a combination product of the statin zocor and zetia that possesses significant potency with respect to reducing ldl cholesterol  but is less effective in increasing hdl cholesterol 
further  there are at least nine versions of generic lovastatin  one of the components of advicor  that have been launched into the large and growing market for cholesterol therapies  which could adversely affect demand for advicor 
the sale of other well known statin therapies and other cholesterol drugs is driven by competitors with stronger promotion and name recognition for their products 
consequently  the company s effort to sell increasing quantities of the advicor product may be unsuccessful 
integration and sales growth of azmacort 
table of contents there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to profitably manage and integrate the azmacort product into the company s sales and marketing campaigns without substantial expenses  delays or other operational or financial problems 
the company s effort to commercialize the azmacort product may require management to devote a disproportionate amount of its resources toward the commercialization and growth of azmacort  which may divert management  sales personnel and financial resources from the company s other products 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that azmacort will achieve the level of revenues that were derived from the sale of such product prior to its acquisition by kos  or that the company will achieve its anticipated revenues and earnings 
prior to the acquisition of the azmacort product by the company  the product had experienced declining sales levels and increased competition from other products 
the failure of the company to manage the commercialization of the azmacort product in a way that reverses the declining trend in the sales of such product  the failure of the company to achieve substantial growth in the sales of the azmacort product  and the failure of the company to source sufficient quantities of azmacort from aventis or its assignee could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operations and financial condition 
uncertainty of future profitability to date  the company has dedicated most of its financial resources to the development and commercialization of the niaspan and advicor products  the development of other products  the acquisition of the azmacort product on march  and general and administrative expenses 
the company has generated an accumulated deficit as of december   of million 
excluding the impact of a million settlement received from bristol myers squibb company in  the company generated full year net income for the first time in the company s ability to maintain profitability will depend  among other things  on the commercial success of the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products  on the company s ability to successfully exploit the company s manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities  on the company s ability to obtain patents  enforce and maintain those patents  preserve trade secrets  and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties  on the company s ability to complete the development of  and obtain regulatory approvals for  and achieve market acceptance for the company s products under development  on the successful outcome of the litigation with barr laboratories  inc  on the company s ability to maintain exclusivity in for its niaspan product  and on the company s ability to maintain sufficient funds to finance the company s activities 
as of december   the company had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards and million of other tax credits 
if the company is unable to sustain profitability  however  its carryforwards and tax credits may not be utilized 
patents and trademarks  litigation with barr laboratories  inc the company s ability to commercialize any of its products under development will depend  in part  on the company s or on its licensors ability to obtain patents  enforce those patents  preserve trade secrets  and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
in addition  the patents that the company has had issued or for which kos has applied relating to niaspan  advicor and certain of the company s products under development are based on  among other things  the extended release nature of the niacin active ingredient 
if the indications treated by niaspan  advicor and such other products under development could be treated using drugs without such extended release properties  such patents and patent applications may not prevent the use of other niacin based drugs for the treatment of such indications  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
further  the company would be adversely affected if the patent applications licensed to or owned by kos do not result in issued patents  
table of contents meaningful patent protection is not secured for any particular technology  or any patents that have been or may be issued to the company or the company s licensors  including the patents covering the company s niaspan product  are invalid  unenforceable or not infringed 
in general  the us patents and patent applications owned by or licensed to kos are directed to compositions and their methods of use 
protection of the chemical entity is not available for the active ingredient in niaspan  or either of the active ingredients in advicor 
moreover  the active ingredient in niaspan  niacin  is currently sold in the united states and other markets for lipid altering indications and for other uses 
the additional active ingredient in advicor  lovastatin  is also currently sold in the united states and other markets for lipid altering indications 
even in jurisdictions where the use of the active ingredients in niaspan and advicor for lipid altering and other indications may be covered by the claims of method of use or composition patents owned by or licensed to kos  off label or dietary supplement sales might occur  especially if another company markets the active ingredient at a price that is less than the price of niaspan or advicor  thereby potentially reducing the sales of such products 
the us patent and trademark office the pto has issued us patent numbers      and  to the company with claims related to niaspan s and advicor s composition and method of use consistent with the recommended once a day regime 
on february   the company entered into an agreement with a generic manufacturer pursuant to which the company and the manufacturer granted cross licenses to each other under their respective patents 
the company has subsequently purchased the patents that were the subject of the cross license agreement and agreed to continue paying a royalty to the manufacturer on terms similar to those contained in the cross license agreement 
the company has received patents and has filed patent applications covering technologies pertaining to propellant driven aerosol formulations that do not contain chlorofluorocarbons 
the company is aware that certain european and us patents have been issued with claims covering products that contain certain propellant driven aerosol formulations that do not contain chlorofluorocarbons 
it may be argued that certain or all of the company s aerosol products under development may use a formulation covered by such european or us patents 
if that is shown to be the case  the company would be prevented from making  using or selling such products unless kos obtains a license under such patents  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or unless such patents are determined to be invalid in europe or invalid or unenforceable in the united states 
the company s development of products that may be covered by such patents and its failure to obtain licenses under such patents in the event such patents are determined to be valid and enforceable could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
on january   the company received notice from barr laboratories  inc barr that it had filed with the fda an abbreviated new drug application anda that  if approved  would allow barr to market a generic version of the company s mg niaspan product 
as a result  on march   the company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against barr in the southern district of new york sdny 
on march   the company filed an amended complaint 
in this lawsuit  the company asserted that barr has infringed kos  and  patents 
on march   barr answered the amended complaint by denying that the and patents are valid and infringed  and seeking a declaratory judgment to that effect 
on august   barr amended its answer to add counterclaims requesting a declaratory judgment that two other patents owned by the company  us patent number  and  are not infringed  and that the patent is invalid 
on july   the company received notice from barr that it had filed an anda with the fda that would  if approved  allow barr to market generic versions of the company s mg and mg niaspan products 
on august   the company filed a second patent infringement lawsuit against 
table of contents barr also in the sdny 
again  the company asserted that barr has infringed the and patents 
on september   barr answered the complaint by denying infringement and alleging that the patents are invalid 
barr also sought a declaratory judgment that the    and patents are not infringed  and that the   and patents are invalid 
the two cases were consolidated on september  on september   the company received notice from barr that it had filed a supplemental paragraph iv certification relating to the company s  patent 
the company filed a third lawsuit on november   against barr in the sdny asserting infringement of this patent 
on december   barr answered the complaint by denying that the patent is valid and infringed  and seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity 
barr also sought a declaratory judgment that the    and patents are not infringed  and that the  and patents are invalid 
the third case was consolidated with the first two on january  on march   the company replied to barr s declaratory judgment counterclaims by denying that the company s patents are invalid or not infringed 
the company also sought a declaratory judgment that one or more of barr s products will infringe the and patents 
on march   the company replied to barr s declaratory judgment counterclaims by denying that the company s patents are invalid or not infringed 
the company also sought a declaratory judgment that one or more of barr s products will infringe the and patents 
from january through february   the company received numerous notices from barr that if had filed a supplemental paragraph iv certification to each anda to provide for the  patent 
on march   the company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against barr in the sdny asserting infringement of this patent 
on april   barr answered the complaint by denying that the patent is valid and infringed and seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity and non infringment 
barr also sought a declaratory judgment that the patent is unenforceable  a declaratory judgment that the     and patents are invalid  and a declaratory judgment that the   and patents are not infringed 
the fourth case was consolidated with the first three on may  from june  through july   the company received numerous notices from barr that barr had filed a supplemental paragraph iv certification to each anda to provide for the  patent 
on september   barr filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity of the patent 
on september   the company answered the complaint by denying invalidity and counterclaiming for infringement and seeking a declaratory judgment of infringement 
barr replied on october   by denying infringement of any valid and enforceable claim of the patent 
the fifth case was consolidated with the first four on september  from november  through december   the company received numerous notices from barr that barr had filed a supplemental paragraph iv certification for each anda to provide for the  patent 
the company is currently evaluating the notices 
because the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions  the patents owned and licensed by kos  or any future patents  may not prevent other companies from developing competing products or ensure that others will not be issued patents that may prevent the sale of the company s products or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties 
furthermore  to the extent that any of the company s future products or methods are not patentable  such products or methods infringe upon the patents of third parties  or the company s patents or future patents fail to give kos an exclusive position in the subject matter to which those patents relate  the company will be adversely affected 
the company may be unable to avoid infringement of third party patents and may have to obtain a license  or defend an infringement action and challenge the validity of the patents in court 
a license may be unavailable on terms and conditions acceptable to the company  if at all 
patent litigation is costly and time consuming  
table of contents and the company may be unable to prevail in any such patent litigation or devote sufficient resources to even pursue such litigation 
if the company does not obtain a license under such patents  or if it is found liable for infringement and if it is not able to have such patents declared invalid  the company may be liable for significant money damages  may encounter significant delays in bringing products to market  or may be precluded from participating in the manufacture  use  or sale of products or methods of treatment requiring such licenses 
marketing of generic niacin product prior to resolution of litigation with barr laboratories  inc the hatch waxman act provides for an automatic stay of the fda s authority to grant marketing approval to barr that would otherwise give barr the right to market its generic niacin product 
this stay is currently set at thirty months and is scheduled to expire on march  upon the expiration of the thirty month stay  the fda could grant final approval to barr and barr could commence the distribution of its generic er niacin products notwithstanding kos patents unless kos were able to obtain an injunction prohibiting such activities by barr 
kos believes that barr may be taking certain actions to prepare for the distribution of its generic er niacin products prior to resolution of the legal proceedings and that barr could begin distributing such generic products as soon as march   although kos has no way of knowing whether or when barr might begin such distribution 
on march   kos sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing barr from distributing its generic er niacin products until the resolution of the pending litigation  however  there can be no assurance that such measures will be granted by the court 
if kos is not able to obtain such a restraining order and injunction  barr could commence marketing and selling a generic alternative to kos niaspan product as soon as the fda gives final approval  which could occur as early as march  although kos could seek from barr recovery of any damages that kos sustains in connection with any distribution activities conducted by barr of a product that infringes a valid and enforceable claim in kos patents  whether kos is ultimately entitled to such damages would be determined by the court in connection with ongoing legal proceedings between kos and barr 
if barr were to commence selling a generic alternative to kos niaspan product prior to the resolution of the ongoing legal proceedings between kos and barr  it would have a material adverse effect on kos and its business  financial condition and results of operations  and could result in the termination of its marketing arrangements with takeda and oryx 
in addition  kos previously issued guidance regarding its projected financial results for would no longer be accurate and kos would have to revise such guidance 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding as of december   the company had million in outstanding borrowings from michael jaharis  the company s principal shareholder  director  and chairman emeritus 
the company can borrow from mr 
jaharis and his transferees up to million under agreements currently in place through june  and  thereafter  up to million under an agreement currently in place through june   provided that the conditions of borrowings have been satisfied including  without limitation  that the death of lender shall not have occurred  the lender  his spouse  children and entities they control continue to own at least of common stock of the company  and no material adverse change shall have occurred to the company or its financial condition 
the repayment of funds borrowed from mr 
jaharis are secured by the pledge of all of the company s assets to him 
as a result  if the company is unable to repay the loans as they become due  the company could be forced to liquidate the company s assets or transfer all of such assets to mr 
jaharis and his transferees 
on january   mr 
jaharis gifted his rights and obligations under the company s outstanding borrowings to his wife 
all other terms and conditions of the borrowings remain unchanged 
the company has spent  and will continue to be required to spend  substantial funds to continue research and development activities  including clinical trials of the company s products under development  and to commercialize the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products and the company s other products under development  if regulatory approvals are obtained for such products under development 

table of contents the company believes that it has sufficient resources  including funds available to it under loans from mrs 
jaharis to fund the company s operations through at least the next twelve months 
even with the proceeds from these sources  however  the company may need or elect to raise additional capital prior to such date 
the company s ability to fund its operating requirements and maintain an adequate level of working capital for the next twelve months will depend primarily on the near term commercial success of niaspan  advicor  and azmacort  its ability to meet the conditions necessary to obtain funding under its lines of credit  including  without limitation  that the death of the lender shall not have occurred  the lender  his spouse  children and entities they control continue to own at least of common stock of the company  and no material adverse change shall have occurred to the company or its financial condition  the problems  delays  expenses and complications frequently encountered by companies at this stage of development  the progress of the company s research  development  and clinical trial programs  the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals of the company s products under development  the company s ability to obtain such regulatory approvals  costs in filing  prosecuting  defending  litigating and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the company s ability to manufacture and supply or have manufactured and supplied sufficient quantities of its niaspan  advicor and azmacort products  the extent and terms of any collaborative research  manufacturing  marketing  or other arrangements  and changes in economic  regulatory  or competitive conditions or the company s planned business 
estimates about the adequacy of funding for the company s activities are based on certain assumptions  including assumptions regarding the marketing and sales success of the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products  the regulatory and commercial success of the advicor product  the outcome of litigation related to the company s intellectual property  including the litigation with barr  and that testing and regulatory procedures relating to the company s other products under development can be conducted at projected costs and within projected time frames 
to the extent these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  the company may have insufficient resources to fund its operations as currently planned 
to satisfy the company s capital requirements  it may seek to raise funds in the public or private capital markets 
the company s ability to raise additional funds in the public markets may be adversely affected if sales of the niaspan  advicor  and azmacort products do not increase rapidly  if the company loses the litigation with barr laboratories  inc  if the results of the clinical trials for the company s products under development are not favorable  or if regulatory approval for any of the company s products under development is not obtained 
the company may seek additional funding through corporate collaborations and other financing vehicles 
if adequate funds are not available to the company  or if available  their terms are unacceptable  the company may be required to significantly reduce its marketing activities for the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products or curtail significantly one or more of the company s research or development programs or the company may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with future collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to the niaspan  advicor or azmacort products or to some or all of the company s technologies or products under development or take significant cost reducing actions or both 
if the company is successful in obtaining additional financing  the terms of the financing may have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of the company s securities 
registration rights the company has granted certain registration rights to its controlling shareholder  mr 
jaharis  his spouse  and their transferees  and to kos investments  inc and kos holdings  inc  which entitle such persons and entities to cause the company to effect an unlimited number of registrations under the securities act of of sales of up to an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock owned or controlled by such persons or entities or that could be acquired by such person or entities upon exercise or conversion of securities they currently hold 
these registration rights generally would also permit the holders of such rights to include shares in any registration statement otherwise filed by the company 
by exercising these registration rights  these persons and entities could cause a large number of shares to be registered and become freely tradeable without restrictions under the securities act except 
table of contents for those purchased in the offering by the company s affiliates immediately upon the effectiveness of such registration 
such sales may have an adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock and could impair the company s ability to raise additional capital 
limited sales and marketing resources although the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products are marketed by the company s own sales forces or through co promotion or commercialization partners  substantial resources will continue to be required for kos to promote the sale of its products 
because its current marketing resources are limited  the company may be unable to devote sufficient resources to the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products  or to the company s products under development or to be acquired or licensed  or to achieve increasing market acceptance of such products in the highly competitive marketplace for cholesterol management therapies 
the company s failure to expend the resources to adequately promote the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products or its other products under development would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
moreover  because the company has fewer sales persons than its competitors  the company s sales force may be unable to detail successfully physicians who prescribe lipid altering or other medications 
the company may not be able to retain its current sales representatives 
even if the company hires additional representatives  they may not be immediately effective in promoting the sale of the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products 
as a result  kos may be unable to generate significantly increased sales of the niaspan  advicor or azmacort products 
the failure of the company s sales representatives to generate increased sales of the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products would have a material adverse effect on operating results 
control by existing shareholder michael jaharis  the company s principal shareholder and a director  beneficially owns  directly or indirectly  including as a member of a group   shares of the company s common stock as of december   or approximately of the common stock outstanding  excluding the impact of warrants to purchase million shares of the company s common stock  as more fully described below 
accordingly  mr 
jaharis can control the outcome of certain shareholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in the company s articles of incorporation  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
this level of concentrated ownership by one person may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the management or voting control of kos 
in addition  a line of credit previously made available by mr 
jaharis to the company  but gifted to mr 
jaharis wife on january   gives mrs 
jaharis the right to exercise warrants to purchase million shares of the company s common stock at per share 
the warrants are non detachable and can be exercised only through the conversion of principal and interest accumulated under the line of credit 
if this warrant exercise was to occur  mr 
jaharis direct or indirect ownership of the company s common stock would increase to  shares  or approximately of the common stock outstanding  assuming the warrant exercise had occurred as of december  competition and technological change many products are commercially available for the treatment of elevated ldl cholesterol  and the manufacturers of such products  individually and collectively  have significantly greater financial resources and sales and manufacturing capabilities than those available to kos  including combined field sales forces exceeding  persons  compared with the company s approximately person cardiovascular field sales force and the sales force of its co promotion partners 
the company s leading competitors and their respective competitive products include  among others abbott tricor bristol myers squibb pravachol 
table of contents merck zocor and mevacor novartis lescol pfizer lipitor  caduet and lopid sankyo welchol merck schering plough zetia and vytorin astrazeneca crestor the company estimates that the existing niaspan and advicor prescriptions account for slightly more than of the total prescriptions currently being written in the united states for cholesterol lowering pharmaceutical compounds 
in addition  zetia  part of a new class of cholesterol lowering agents that inhibit the intestinal absorption of cholesterol  was launched in november by merck schering plough pharmaceuticals 
crestor  a new highly powerful statin product  was launched during september by astrazeneca 
vytorin  a combination product of the statin zocor and zetia  was launched in july by merck schering plough pharmaceuticals  which is a joint venture between merck co  inc and schering plough corporation 
both merck schering plough pharmaceuticals and astrazeneca are competitors who have substantially greater resources than those available to kos 
finally  there are at least nine versions of generic lovastatin  one of the components of advicor  currently being marketed in the cholesterol market 
the existence of distributors of generic lovastatin and the competitive environment they create may inhibit the niaspan and advicor products from competing successfully or from achieving increased sales 
further  there is ongoing discussion at the fda concerning the potential approval of lovastatin as an over the counter drug 
the sheer size and rapid growth of the patient population for which cholesterol therapies are indicated  continue to induce new entry of competing cardiovascular and cholesterol products 
moreover  the active ingredient in niaspan  niacin  is available in several other formulations  most of which do not require a prescription 
although the company believes that there are no other currently available niacin formulations that have been approved by the fda specifically for once a day dosing  physicians may decide to prescribe or recommend some of these unapproved niacin formulations  using the niaspan product s dosing regimen  to try to achieve the same results as niaspan 
substitution of other niacin formulations for the niaspan product could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
moreover  manufacturers of other niacin formulations could promote their products using the niaspan product s dosing regimen and could promote the sale of their products to treat the indications for which the company has received clearance to market niaspan 
although such promotion would be a violation of fda regulations  the significant occurrence of such practices would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the emergence of new cholesterol management products or generic entry would have a material adverse effect on the company 
there are also many products that are commercially available for the treatment of the respiratory condition addressed by azmacort  and the manufacturers of such products have significantly greater financial resources and sales and manufacturing capabilities than those available to kos  including combined field sales forces exceeding  persons  compared with the company s approximately person field sales force 
further  there are many products that are commercially available for the treatment of the respiratory condition addressed by azmacort  and the manufacturers of such products have significantly greater financial resources and sales and manufacturing capabilities than those available to kos 
the primary competitors of the azmacort product include  among others advair and flovent glaxosmithkline aerobid forest pulmicort astrazeneca vanceril schering plough qvar ivax 
table of contents moreover  many established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities  and other research institutions with resources significantly greater than kos may develop products that directly compete with the company s products 
even if the company s products under development prove to be more effective than those developed by other entities  such other entities may be more successful in marketing their products than kos because of greater financial resources  stronger sales and marketing efforts  and other factors 
if these entities are successful in developing products that are safer  more effective  better promoted  or less costly than the products developed by kos  the company s products may be unable to compete successfully with any of those products 
international commercialization agreement with merck kgaa on october   the company signed an exclusive international commercialization agreement with merck to market the niaspan and advicor products outside the united states  canada and japan 
under the terms of the merck agreement  merck will provide kos up to million in licensing  milestone and reimbursement payments 
through december   kos has received million in upfront  reimbursement  and milestone payments from merck  including million of upfront and reimbursement payments 
kos is responsible for obtaining initial marketing authorization in all european countries and the supply and manufacturing of the products 
pursuant to certain provisions of the merck agreement  if marketing authorization is not obtained for niaspan and advicor in certain countries and within certain timeframes  kos will be required to refund to merck up to million of the upfront payments 
in addition  other milestone payments payable to kos under the merck agreement are dependent on the achievement of marketing authorization of niaspan in certain countries  the achievement of marketing authorization of advicor in certain countries  and achieving certain net sales thresholds of niaspan and advicor 
in  kos received marketing approval for niaspan in the united kingdom  and in  submitted advicor for marketing approval in the united kingdom 
in november  merck launched the sale of niaspan in the united kingdom 
following this initial launch and the december  completion of the european union s mutual recognition procedure mrp  niaspan has since been approved in a total of european markets  including such other markets as france  germany  austria  ireland  belgium and the netherlands 
merck and kos have also initiated a second wave of the mrp for the additional european countries that were recently added to the list of european union countries 
niaspan has also been approved in other countries outside the european union  including lebanon and certain latin american countries 
there is no certainty that further marketing authorization for the niaspan product and final authorization for the advicor product will be obtained under the mrp  or  with respect to advicor  at all  and there could be delays in the granting of such authorizations 
consequently  kos may be required to reimburse merck for up to million of the upfront payments and may not receive any further milestone payments under the merck agreement 
no assurance of adequate third party reimbursement the company s ability to commercialize successfully its products under development is dependent in part on the extent to which appropriate levels of reimbursement for the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products are obtained from government authorities  private health insurers  and managed care organizations such as health maintenance organizations or hmos 
the company estimates that  through december   approximately million  or  of the company s cumulative niaspan  advicor and azmacort revenue has been subjected to the reimbursement rules of such organizations 
managed care organizations and other third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of pharmaceutical products 
the trend toward managed healthcare in the united states  the growth of organizations such as hmos  and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of pharmaceutical products  resulting in lower prices 
table of contents and reduced demand for niaspan  advicor and azmacort products  or the company s products under development 
such cost containment measures and potential legislative reform could affect the company s ability to sell niaspan  advicor  azmacort or its products under development and may have a material adverse effect on the company 
significant uncertainty exists about the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products 
although the company has obtained approvals for reimbursement for the cost of niaspan  advicor and azmacort products from many third party payors  such approvals  in the united states and in foreign countries  may be discontinued or unavailable for its existing products or any of the company s products under development 
the unavailability or inadequacy of third party reimbursement for niaspan  advicor  azmacort or the company s products under development or to be acquired or licensed  may reduce the demand for  or negatively affect the price of  these products  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
dependence on collaborators the company relies on various third parties for certain aspects of the development  manufacture and promotion of the company s present and planned products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into future collaborative arrangements on favorable terms  or at all 
even if the company is successful in entering into such collaborative agreements  there can be no assurance that any such arrangement will be successful 
the success of any such arrangement is dependent on  among other things  the skills  experience and efforts of the third party s employees responsible for the project  the third party s commitment to the arrangement  and the financial condition of the third party  all of which are beyond the control of the company 
dependence on key personnel the company s success is dependent on the company s ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  management  and sales personnel 
in april  the company hired its current president and chief executive officer  adrian adams 
the loss of mr 
adams as the company s president and chief executive officer could have a material adverse effect on its operations and business 
due to intense competition for personnel from other companies  academic institutions  government entities  and other organizations  the company may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key personnel 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain the additional  highly skilled employees required for the expansion of kos activities  could adversely affect its business and operating results 
products under development although the company has obtained clearance from the fda to market the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products  the company may be unsuccessful in effectively formulating any of its other products as planned 
further  the company may not be successful in demonstrating the safety and efficacy of such products in human clinical trials 
these trials may be costly and time consuming 
the administration of any product the company develops may produce undesirable side effects that could result in the interruption  delay or suspension of clinical trials  or the failure to obtain fda or other regulatory approval for any or all targeted indications 
even if regulatory approval is secured  the company s products under development may later produce adverse effects that limit or prevent their widespread use or that necessitate their withdrawal from the market 
the company may discontinue the development of any of its products under development at any time 
acquisition of products as part of the company s growth strategy  the company intends to acquire and develop additional product candidates or approved products 
the success of this strategy depends upon kos ability to identify  select and acquire pharmaceutical products that meet the criteria it has established 
any product candidate the company acquires will require additional research and development efforts prior to commercial sale  including extensive pre clinical and or clinical testing and approval by the fda and 
table of contents corresponding foreign regulatory authorities 
all product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that the product candidate will not be safe  non toxic and effective or approved by regulatory authorities 
in addition  the company cannot assure that any approved products that it develops or acquires will be manufactured or produced economically  successfully commercialized  widely accepted in the marketplace or that the company will be able to recover its significant expenditures in connection with the development or acquisition of such products 
in addition  proposing  negotiating and implementing an economically viable acquisition is a lengthy and complex process 
other companies  including those with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  may compete with the company for the acquisition of product candidates and approved products 
the company may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates and approved products on terms that it finds acceptable  or at all 
in addition  if the company acquires product candidates from third parties  the company will be dependent on third parties to supply such products to the company for sale 
the company could be materially adversely affected by the failure or inability of such suppliers to meet performance  reliability and quality standards 
government regulation  no assurances of regulatory approval the company s research and development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacturing and marketing of the company s products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
the drug development and approval process takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit  or prevent regulatory approval 
although the company may consult the fda for guidance in developing protocols for clinical trials  despite such consultation  the fda may find the clinical trials inadequate or not well controlled 
they may also reject the results of those trials altogether 
in addition  delays or rejections of applications for regulatory approval may result from changes in or additions to fda regulations concerning the drug approval process 
thus  regulatory reviews may be untimely and regulatory approvals could be denied for products developed by the company 
even if regulatory approval of a product is obtained  the approval will be limited as to the indicated uses for which it may be promoted or marketed 
in addition  a marketed drug  its bulk chemical supplier  its manufacturer  and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual regulatory review and periodic inspections  and later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  supplier  manufacturer  or facility may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturers  which may require a withdrawal of the product from the market 
failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or abroad can  among other things  result in fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  seizure of products  product recalls  operating restrictions  and criminal prosecution  any of which could have a material adverse effect on kos 
outside the united states  the company s research and development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacturing and marketing of the company s products are subject to extensive foreign regulation 
in the european union  the approval of new drugs is governed by the central approval or mutual recognition procedures of the european medicines evaluation agency emea 
in  the company received marketing approval for niaspan in the united kingdom  and in  submitted advicor for marketing approval in the united kingdom 
pursuant to the merck agreement  the company is responsible for obtaining initial marketing authorization for the niaspan and advicor products in the european union 
there could be delays or rejections in applications for regulatory approval in europe and in other countries  as well a requirement of completion of additional preclinical and clinical studies 
the process of obtaining regulatory approval could be costly 
in addition  competitors of the company may obtain regulatory approval for similar products 
even if regulatory approval of a product is obtained  the approval will be limited as to the indicated uses for which it may be promoted or marketed  and the product will be subject to a continual regulatory review and inspections  which  if previously unknown problems are discovered  may result in restrictions on the products and manufacturers  which may require a withdrawal of the product from the market 
in addition  individual countries will have pricing  third 
table of contents party reimbursement and labeling approvals necessary for the manufacture  distribution  use and sale of products with which the company must comply 
moreover  because the legislative and regulatory environment continues to evolve in the us and abroad  it is difficult to predict the impact of legislation and regulations on the company and its products 
in addition  the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies  such as the us department of health and human services  the federal trade commission and the department of justice 
individual states  acting through their attorneys general  have become active as well  seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 
these regulatory authorities have wide ranging administrative powers to deal with any failure to comply with their ongoing regulatory oversight 
these powers include withdrawal of a license approval previously granted  product recalls  seizure of products and other sanctions for non compliance 
kos has recently learned that the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services  in conjunction with the us department of justice  is conducting an investigation of certain of kos sales practices but kos has not been able to confirm the scope of the investigation 
kos has engaged outside counsel to assist it in conducting its own internal investigation of its sales practices but has not been able to reach any conclusions because of the preliminary and uncertain nature of the information of which it is currently aware 
regulatory sanction following a failure to comply with such ongoing regulatory oversight could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
while the company has compliance measures in place to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements  there can be no assurance that employees will not deviate from the company s policies and legal requirements in such a way that it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s business is also subject to regulation under state  federal and local laws  rules  regulations  and policies relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety  including those governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling  and disposal of certain materials 
the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all such laws  rules  regulations  and policies applicable to kos 
however  non compliance with such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the future would require kos to incur significant costs to comply 
the company s research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials 
although the company believes that its safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable state  federal  and local regulations  the risk of contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such contamination or injury  the company could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed its resources and materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing on december   the fda issued the company a warning letter related to a routine  unannounced inspection of the company s manufacturing facility located in edison  new jersey 
the letter cited four deficiencies in the company s quality systems 
the company now has remedied these deficiencies to the satisfaction of the fda and has regained its fda current good manufacturing practices cgmp compliance status 
the company s manufacturing facilities  and those of its third party manufacturers  are and will continue to be subject to  ongoing  periodic inspection by the fda and state agencies to ensure  among other things  compliance with cgmp 
the company s and its suppliers failure to follow and document the company s adherence to such cgmp regulations or other regulatory requirements may lead to significant delays in the availability of the company s products  including the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products  for commercial use or clinical study  may result 
table of contents in the termination or hold of a clinical study  or may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for kos products 
the company also may encounter problems with  among other things  the following achieving consistent and acceptable production yield and costs  meeting product release specifications  quality control and assurance  shortages of qualified manufacturing personnel  shortages of raw materials  shortages of key contractors  and ongoing compliance with the fda and other regulations 
any of the foregoing could result in the company being unable to manufacture and supply or have manufactured and supplied sufficient quantities of its niaspan  advicor and azmacort products to meet the demands of its customers  or to fulfill orders from its international marketing partner 
the company s failure for any reason to manufacture and supply or have manufactured and supplied sufficient quantities of the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products would have a material adverse impact on the company and its financial condition 
the extent of such adverse effect would depend on the nature  timing  scope and duration of the manufacturing issues 
although the company is currently in discussions with a contract manufacturer for certain of its products  the company does not currently have a qualified backup manufacturing capability with a third party 
in the event that the company is not successful in its litigation with barr  or if barr commences distribution of its generic er niacin product prior to the resolution of such litigation  then the company may choose to enter into an arrangement with an authorized generic distributor pursuant to which such distributor would distribute a generic version of kos niaspan products that are manufactured by the company 
in such event  the company would need to modify its manufacturing processes to manufacture the generic version of its products instead of the branded versions 
this may result in the company having inadequate supply of the generic version or the branded version  or both 
the company s failure for any reason to manufacture and supply sufficient quantities of either the branded or generic versions of its niaspan products would have a material adverse impact on the company and its financial condition 
failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could also result in sanctions being imposed on the company  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of the company s products  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could harm the company s business 
if the company is unable to manufacture its products for any reason  the company s options for outsourcing manufacturing are currently limited 
it would take a substantial period of time for a contract manufacturing facility that has not been producing the company s particular products to begin producing them under cgmp regulations 
limited manufacturing experience  risk of scale up the company currently manufactures the niaspan and advicor products in one manufacturing plant in edison  new jersey that has been inspected and approved by the fda for both niaspan and advicor 
although both products have been approved for manufacture in the edison facility  the company has 
table of contents limited experience in manufacturing products for commercial sale in the edison facility and inefficiencies may exist in the manufacturing process 
the company may need to further scale up certain of the company s current manufacturing processes to achieve production levels consistent with the commercial sale of its products for both us and international use 
further  modifications to the facilities  systems  and procedures may be necessary to maintain capacity at a level sufficient to meet market demand or to maintain compliance with cgmp regulations and other regulations prescribed by various regulatory agencies including the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency 
the company s failure to successfully further scale up  expand in connection with manufacture for commercial sale  or modify the company s manufacturing process or to comply with current good manufacturing practices regulations and other regulations could delay the approval of its products under development or limit its ability to meet the demand for its products  any of which would have a material adverse effect on kos 
such occurrences may require kos to acquire alternative means of manufacturing the company s products  which may not be available on a timely basis  on commercially practicable terms  or at all 
dependence on single sources of supply some materials used in the company s products  including the active ingredients in niaspan and advicor  are currently sourced from single qualified suppliers 
the company has not established arrangements with alternative suppliers for these ingredients  although the company believes that it can obtain an alternative supply of lovastatin  one of the two active ingredients in advicor  if necessary 
although the company has maintained a business relationship with its niacin supplier since  and has not experienced difficulty to date in acquiring niacin  or other materials for product development  additional product validations and regulatory submissions would be required if supply interruptions were to occur in the future or if the company had to obtain substitute materials 
similarly  the company s source for lovastatin is relatively inexperienced as a supplier of such ingredient 
although the company has maintained a business relationship with its lovastatin supplier since  and this supplier is experienced as a supplier of other pharmaceutical grade active ingredients  this supplier may be unable to meet the company s requirements for lovastatin on a sustained basis  at an acceptable quality standard  or at a commercially viable price 
in such an event  the company would be forced to obtain an alternative supplier of lovastatin 
any interruption of raw material supply  for any reason  in any of the required ingredients for the company s products could have a material adverse effect on kos ability to manufacture its products or to obtain or maintain regulatory approval of such products 
the company obtains the azmacort product pursuant to the azmacort supply agreement  which will remain in effect until at least march  as such  the company relies on aventis to manufacture and supply adequate quantities of the finished azmacort product 
although there is one other company that is currently qualified to manufacture and supply the azmacort product  the company does not have any contractual arrangement with such other entity 
as a result  the company relies solely on aventis to supply the company with the azmacort product  and the company cannot provide any assurances that aventis will be able to produce sufficient quantities of the azmacort product to meet the company s requirements 
the azmacort product can be difficult to produce and requires the assembly of several different components  the unavailability of any of which can result in an interruption in the supply of finished azmacort products to the company 
the manufacture and assembly of each of the components  in addition to the qualification of the raw materials used in the finished azmacort product  is subject to regulatory approval 
if kos  aventis or aventis suppliers are unable to maintain the regulatory approval for such components  raw materials or finished product  or are unable to manufacture and store them in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  aventis may not be able to supply the company with sufficient quantities of the finished azmacort product 
the company is dependent on the performance by aventis and its suppliers for the manufacture and supply of the finished azmacort products  and the company cannot provide any assurance of their willingness or ability to perform their manufacturing responsibilities in the future 
any interruption of supply  for any reason  of the finished 
table of contents azmacort product to the company would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
on february   the company was informed by aventis that it intends  by march   to close on a transaction to sell the manufacturing plant where the azmacort product is manufactured to a third party 
risk of product liability claims  no assurance of adequate insurance manufacturing  marketing  selling  and testing niaspan  advicor  azmacort and the company s products under development or to be acquired or licensed  entails a risk of product liability 
on august   bayer ag  removed its statin product  baycol  from the market because of multiple deaths attributed to a rare form of a muscle disorder called rhabdomyolysis 
as a result of the removal of baycol from the market  however  the side affects of statin products have been subject to increased scrutiny 
although the statin component of advicor has been approved by the fda and marketed for nearly years and is a different drug compound than that which was used in baycol  to the extent that patients who take advicor develop serious adverse side affects  such as rhabdomyolysis  or associate the adverse events experienced by some baycol patients with all other statin products  including the company s advicor product  it would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company could be subject to product liability claims in the event that its products or products under development fail to perform as intended 
even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds in litigation and the diversion of management time and resources and could damage the company s reputation and impair the marketability of its products 
while the company currently maintains liability insurance  the company may not be able to maintain such insurance at a commercially reasonable cost 
if a successful claim were made against the company  and the amount of insurance were inadequate to cover the costs of defending against or paying such a claim  or the damages payable by kos  the company would experience a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations and on the price of the company s common stock 
possible stock price volatility the stock market  including the nasdaq national market  on which the company s shares are listed  has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  the market price of the company s common stock  like the stock prices of many publicly traded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  has been and may continue to be highly volatile 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the fiscal periods indicated  the range of high and low prices for trades of the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market system 
high low year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter the sale by the company s controlling shareholder or members of the company s management of shares of common stock  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by the company or its competitors  developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights  the outcome of the litigation with barr  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products or to products under development by kos or its competitors  regulatory developments in either the united states or foreign countries  public concern as to the safety of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products  and economic and other external factors  as well as the trend of prescriptions for the niaspan  advicor and azmacort products and the period to period fluctuations in sales or other financial results  among other factors  may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
anti takeover provisions certain provisions of the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws generally permit removal of directors only for cause by a vote of the shareholders  require a vote of the shareholders to amend the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws  require a demand of at least of the company s shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders  and prohibit shareholder actions by written consent 
certain of such provisions also allow the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock 
moreover  provisions of the florida business corporation act  to which the company is subject  prohibit the voting of shares that are 
table of contents acquired in certain takeovers without the approval of the board of directors or the approval by a majority of the corporation s voting shares
