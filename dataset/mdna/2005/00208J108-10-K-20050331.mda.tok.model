table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview general atp oil gas corporation is engaged in the acquisition  development and production of oil and natural gas properties in the gulf of mexico and the north sea 
we seek to acquire and develop properties with proved undeveloped reserves pud that are economically attractive to us but are not strategic to major or large exploration oriented independent oil and gas companies 
occasionally we will acquire properties where previous drilling has encountered reservoirs that appear to us to contain commercially productive quantities of oil and gas even though the reservoirs do not meet the sec definition of proved reserves 
we believe that our strategy provides assets for us to develop and produce without the risk  cost or time of traditional exploration 
we seek to create value and reduce operating risks through the acquisition and development of proved oil and natural gas reserves in areas that have significant undeveloped reserves  close proximity to developed markets for oil and natural gas  existing infrastructure of oil and natural gas pipelines and production processing platforms  and a relatively stable regulatory environment for offshore oil and natural gas development and production 
our focus is on acquiring properties that have become non core or non strategic to their original owners for a variety of reasons 
for example  larger oil companies from time to time adjust their capital spending or shift their focus to exploration prospects which they believe offer greater reserve potential 
some projects provide lower economic returns to a company due to its cost structure within that company 
also  due to timing or budget constraints  a company may be unwilling or unable to develop a property before the expiration of the lease 
because of our cost structure  expertise in our areas of focus and ability to develop projects  the properties may be more financially attractive to us than the seller 
given our strategy of acquiring properties that contain proved reserves  our operations typically are lower risk than exploration focused gulf of mexico and north sea operators 
as a result of this strategy  we have successfully brought out of projects with proved undeveloped reserve to production since our inception 
we focus on developing projects in the shortest time possible between initial significant investment and first revenue generated in order to maximize our rate of return 
since we operate a significant number of the properties in which we acquire a working interest  we are able to significantly influence the development concept and timing of a project s development 
we typically initiate new development projects by simultaneously obtaining the various required components such as the pipeline and the production platform or subsea well completion equipment 
we believe this strategy  combined with our strong technical abilities to evaluate and implement a project s requirements  allows us to efficiently complete the development project and commence production 
to enhance the economics and return on investment of a project  we sometimes develop the project to a value creation point and either sell an interest or bring in partners on a promoted basis during the high capital development phase 
in  we sold a interest in our helvellyn project in the uk sector north sea after we had obtained field development approval for the project and finalized contractual commitments 
in  we sold interests in three projects in the gulf of mexico on a promoted basis to reduce the amount of capital employed 
we continued this practice into whereupon we sold of our interest in seven projects containing ten offshore blocks in the gulf of mexico for million  approximately mcfe for proved reserves  of which were proved undeveloped reserves 

table of contents review of the year was a year of major financial improvement and development success for atp 
we completed three financing transactions  two debt and one equity  improved working capital by million and ended with million of cash and cash equivalents 
these financing transactions and cash from operating activities provided us the liquidity to enjoy our most active development year since becoming a publicly traded company in february the three financing transactions for atp in were instrumental in providing the funds needed to complete our developments and provide us the initial financial resources for our program 
in march  we replaced our previous million revolving credit facility with a new million term loan comprised of a first lien of million and a second lien of million 
the new five year term loan improved our liquidity position by million and allowed us to aggressively begin our development program 
in september we amended the term loan by adding million to the first lien  reducing the interest rate on the first lien by basis points and amending certain covenants of the facility to provide us more flexibility 
as a result of putting in place a term facility and its subsequent amendment  interest expense increased to million for  compared to million for after repurchasing of outstanding warrants that were issued in conjunction with the march transaction  the amendment provided us with an additional million of liquidity 
by december   our share price had risen from at the beginning of the year to approximately per share  an increase of over 
as a result  we elected to issue four million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
the financing transactions net of costs and repayments of previously outstanding amounts provided us with approximately million of liquidity and collectively were the catalysts in achieving such a productive year 
in the first quarter of  we completed and placed on production helvellyn  our first well in the north sea 
we initially drilled this well in late  encountered delays beyond our control during early and mid  and ultimately made the decision to side track the well to achieve first production in february total development costs related to helvellyn in were million and other north sea properties accounted for million 
the impact of helvellyn was a contributing factor to our increase in production  the largest annual increase in production as a publicly traded company 
in the gulf of mexico we completed wells at six different properties 
at garden banks  adjacent to our garden banks property and the host platform for garden banks  we placed on production one well 
development at these properties  together known as matia cabrito  began in when the platform was installed and the well at garden banks was placed on production 
at ship shoal  four wells were drilled and placed on production during like matia cabrito  the platform was installed during and drilling was completed in noteworthy with both the ship shoal and the matia cabrito developments was the reuse of platforms from other atp locations 
the significance was not that platforms were reused  which often happens in the gulf of mexico  but that the platforms were moved to deeper water depths than originally located 
this required us to install plinths  or leg extensions  to accomplish the installations 
in december  atp was awarded the offshore energy achievement award for innovation technology for its innovative use of plinths 
the innovation technology award honors a new technology that has been field proven or an innovative application of existing technology that resulted in a material improvement in safety  throughput or cost savings 
during the company also completed three wells at west cameron  two wells at matagorda island  one well at west cameron and two wells at eugene island in the fourth quarter  we tested a well at mississippi canyon  presently our largest property in terms of proved reserves 
the mississippi canyon st well which logged approximately total net feet of oil and gas pay in lower pliocene sands tested at a rate of  bopd and mmcf d or mmcfe d 
the multiple day flow test recorded flowing tubing pressures exceeding psi 
additional development is scheduled at mississippi canyon during with first production currently scheduled for early in the fourth quarter total development and exploratory costs incurred in in the gulf of mexico was million 

table of contents at the end of  we were drilling two wells  one at west cameron and the other at high island the well at west cameron began production on january  the well at high island which was one of our properties not included in our reserve report as it did not meet the sec definition of proved reserves is scheduled to begin production during the second quarter as a result of the production from helvellyn  a natural gas well  our natural gas component of production increased to in from in we also increased our average realized price in as a result of higher oil and natural gas prices and higher prices for those quantities we hedged 
for  we realized an average price including the effect of cash flow hedges for natural gas of per mcf  an increase of over  and per barrel of oil  an increase of over at december   we had proved reserves of bcfe  of which are located in the gulf of mexico and the remaining in the north sea 
the pre tax pv of our proved reserves at december  was million 
see item properties oil and natural gas reserves for a reconciliation to after tax pv we currently have properties that have proved undeveloped reserves totaling bcfe scheduled for future development including properties in the gulf of mexico  two in the uk sector north sea and one in the dutch sector north sea 
in addition  we have scheduled for drilling or completion  properties where previous drilling into the targeted reservoirs indicates to the company the presence of commercially productive quantities of hydrocarbons even though the reservoirs do not meet the sec definition of proved reserves 
five blocks acquired in in the gulf of mexico and cheviot in the north sea  potentially the largest property in the company s portfolio  are not included in the reserve report as they did not meet the sec definition of proved reserves at the end of upon completion of plans which may include drilling  completion or testing of wells for these and similar properties in the company s portfolio  the company anticipates that it may be able to record proved reserves associated with several of these properties 
in  we sold an undivided interest in seven properties on ten blocks in the gulf of mexico 
this sale accounted for a reduction in our proved reserves of bcfe of which were classified as proved undeveloped at the time of the sale 
we received million for this sale or approximately per mcfe and recognized a gain of million from the transaction 
after adjusting for production and the sale of the interest in the seven properties  atp recorded net upward revisions and extensions in proved reserves during of bcfe 
operational and financial objectives we believe that production will exceed that of as a result of our and development programs and projects scheduled for development in development activities scheduled at mississippi canyon during include laying approximately miles of oil and gas pipelines  converting a semi submersible drilling rig to a floating production facility  completing a second well which was previously drilled in the southern portion of the block and connecting for production both wells 
first production is currently scheduled for early in the fourth quarter in addition to mississippi canyon  developments with proved undeveloped reserves at december  planned in include block l d in the dutch sector of the north sea and additional properties in the gulf of mexico 
we also have scheduled for drilling or completion properties in which previous drilling into targeted reservoirs indicates to the company the presence of commercially productive quantities of hydrocarbons  although these reservoirs did not meet the sec definition of proved reserves at the end of other potential developments for in the gulf of mexico and north sea are currently being evaluated 
atp plans to devote considerable attention in to evaluating the potential of its cheviot property in the north sea 
this property produced from before it was taken off production by the previous owner 
we completed a d seismic survey in the fourth quarter of which is currently being processed and interpreted 
once this work is completed  we will continue our evaluation utilizing not only the d seismic  but also previous drilling and production information 
we expect to complete a plan for the cheviot property during with the goal of recording proved undeveloped reserves by the end of additional locations within the cheviot property but outside of the reservoirs that previously produced are also being evaluated for possible drilling  development or exploration 

table of contents our production may command higher realized oil and gas prices in than in recent years  based on our current hedge position and strong commodity prices 
our revenues  profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon many factors  particularly our production results and the price of oil and natural gas 
during the first quarter of we have been active in the futures market 
we have hedged volumes for of bcf of natural gas between and per mmbtu and thousand barrels of crude oil between and per barrel 
including these recent hedges  we have hedged bcfe of our production at an average price of mmbtue and bcfe of our production at an average price of mmbtue 
to mitigate future price volatility  we may hedge additional production  especially if commodity prices continue to rise 
in  we recorded an income tax expense of million primarily due to us recording a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax asset as required by sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas provides for the weighing of positive and negative evidence in determining whether a deferred tax asset is recoverable 
while we recorded net income in  we have incurred net operating losses in and prior consecutive years 
relevant accounting guidance suggests that cumulative losses in recent years constitute significant negative evidence  and that future expectations about income are overshadowed by such history of losses 
delays in bringing properties on to production and development cost overruns in were also significant factors considered in evaluating our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
if we achieve profitable operations in  we expect to reverse a portion of the valuation allowance in an amount at least sufficient to eliminate any tax provision in that period and may also reverse a portion or all of the remaining valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will utilize the remaining deferred tax asset 
results of operations for the year ended december   we recorded net income of million or per share and for the years ended december  and  we reported net losses million or per share and million or per share  respectively 
oil and gas revenues revenues presented in the table and the discussion below represent revenue from sales of our oil and natural gas production volumes 
production sold under fixed price delivery contracts  which have been designated for the normal purchase and sale exemption under sfas  are also included in these amounts 
approximately  and of our oil production was sold under these contracts for the years ended december   and  respectively 
approximately  and of our natural gas production was sold under these contracts for the comparable periods 
the realized prices below may differ from the market prices in effect during the periods depending on when the fixed price delivery contract was executed

oil and gas revenue increased in compared to as the result of properties brought on line during  including our helvellyn property  located in the uk sector north sea 
another component of the increase was a increase in our sales price per mcfe in as compared to due to the shut down of helvellyn in september as a result of maintenance at the receiving terminal and the interruption of gulf of mexico production due to the hurricanes experienced during the third quarter of  approximately bcfe of production was deferred into future periods 
the decrease in oil and gas revenue in compared to was the result of a decrease in production volumes as a result of natural decline  adverse weather conditions and repairs on pipelines and host platform facilities 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in our price realizations

the covenants include current ratio of  consolidated net debt to ebitdax coverage ratio which is not greater than through june  and at each of the quarters ending thereafter  consolidated ebitdax to interest expense which is not less than for any four consecutive fiscal quarters commencing with the quarter ended june  and at each of the quarters ending thereafter  pre tax pv of our total proved developed producing oil and gas reserves to net debt of at least at june and december of any fiscal year  pre tax pv of our total proved oil and gas reserves to net debt of at least at june and december of any fiscal year  net debt to proved developed oil and gas reserves of less than mcfe at december  and at each of the years ending thereafter  and the requirement to maintain hedges on no less than of the next twelve months of forecasted production attributable to our proved producing reserves 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of our term loan 
significant adverse changes in our expected production levels  commodity prices and reserves or material delays or cost overruns could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations and result in our non compliance with these covenants 
an event of non compliance with any of the required covenants could result in a material mandatory repayment under the term loan

contractual obligations we have various commitments primarily related to leases for office space  other property and equipment and other agreements 
the following table summarizes certain contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years years after years long term debt interest on long term debt non cancelable operating leases total contractual obligations interest is based on rates and quarterly principal payments in effect at december  our liabilities also include asset retirement obligations million current and million long term that represent the estimated fair value at december  of our obligations with respect to the retirement abandonment of our oil and gas properties 
each reporting period the liability is accreted to its then present value 
the ultimate settlement amount and the timing of the settlement of such obligations is unknown because they are subject to  among other things  federal  state and local regulation and economic factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
such estimates and judgments are evaluated and modified as necessary on an ongoing basis 
significant estimates include dd a of proved oil and gas properties 
oil and gas reserve estimates  which are the basis for unit of production dd a and the impairment analysis  are inherently imprecise and are expected to change as future information becomes available 
in addition  alternatives may exist among various accounting methods 
in such cases  the choice of accounting method may also have a significant impact on reported amounts 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies discussed below and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of our company 
oil and gas property accounting oil and gas exploration and production companies may elect to account for their property costs using either the successful efforts or full cost accounting method 
under the successful efforts method  lease acquisition costs and intangible drilling and development costs on successful wells and development dry holes are capitalized 
costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when a well is determined to be unsuccessful 
selection of the oil and gas accounting method can have a significant impact on a company s financial results 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting and generally pursue acquisitions and development of proved reserves as opposed to exploration activities 
capitalized costs relating to producing properties are depleted on the units of production method 
proved developed reserves are used in computing unit rates for drilling and development costs and total proved reserves for depletion rates of leasehold  platform and pipeline costs 
estimated dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs and estimated residual salvage values are taken into account in determining amortization and depletion provisions 
expenditures for geological and geophysical testing costs are generally charged to expense unless the costs can be specifically attributed to mapping a proved reservoir and determining the optimal placement for future developmental well locations 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred  renewals and betterments are capitalized 
the costs and related accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization of properties sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts  and gains or losses on disposition are reflected in the statements of operations 
costs directly associated with the acquisition and evaluation of unproved properties are excluded from the amortization base until the related properties are developed 
unproved properties are periodically assessed and any impairment in value is charged to impairment expense 
the costs of unproved properties are transferred to proved oil and gas properties upon meeting sec requirements and amortized on a unit of production 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in 
table of contents available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties 
this method requires us to amortize the capitalized costs incurred in developing a property in proportion to the amount of oil and gas produced as a percentage of the amount of proved reserves contained in the property 
accordingly  changes in reserve estimates as described above will cause corresponding changes in depletion expense recognized in periods subsequent to the reserve estimate revision 
our gulf of mexico and netherlands reserves quantities are prepared annually by independent petroleum engineers ryder scott company  lp and our lp sector north sea reserves are prepared annually by independent petroleum consultants rps troy ikoda limited 
see the supplemental information unaudited in our consolidated financial statements for reserve data related to our properties 
impairment analysis we perform an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
to determine if a depletable unit is impaired  we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management s estimates of future oil and gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the property 
future net cash flows are based upon reservoir engineers estimates of proved reserves 
in addition  other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions and actual or planned drilling or other development activities 
for a property determined to be impaired  an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the impaired property will be recognized 
fair value  on a depletable unit basis  is estimated to be the present value of the aforementioned expected future net cash flows 
an impairment allowance is provided on an unproved property when we determine that the property will not be developed 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation  depletion  impairment and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment  including the determination of the depletable units estimated reserves  future cash flows and fair value 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations related to the plugging and abandonment of our oil and gas wells  dismantling our offshore production platforms  and the removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and returning such land to its original condition 
sfas requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation  discount it to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including the ultimate expected cost of the obligation  the expected future date of the required cash payment  and interest and inflation rates 
revisions to these estimates may be required based on changes to cost estimates  the timing of settlement  and changes in legal requirements 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis 
see note  asset retirement obligations  to the consolidated financial statements 
contingent liabilities in preparing financial statements at any point in time  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings and the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are involved in actions from time to time  which if determined adversely  could have a material negative impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
management  with the assistance of counsel makes estimates  if determinable  of atp s probable liabilities and records such amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
such estimates may be the minimum amount of a range of probable loss when no single best estimate is determinable 
disclosure is made  when determinable  of any additional possible amount of loss on 
table of contents these claims  or if such estimate cannot be made  that fact is disclosed 
along with our counsel  we monitor developments related to these legal matters and  when appropriate  we make adjustments to recorded liabilities to reflect current facts and circumstances 
although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  management believes that the recorded amounts  if any  are reasonable 
price risk management activities we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts and fixed price physical contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we primarily utilize fixed price physical contracts and price swaps  which are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counter parties of high credit quality that we believe are minimal credit risks 
the oil and natural gas reference prices of these commodity derivatives contracts are based upon oil and natural gas  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices we receive 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
for qualifying fair value hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is offset by related results of the hedged item in the income statement 
gains and losses on hedging instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to oil and natural gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded in oil and natural gas revenues 
as of december   we had three derivative contracts in place that qualified as cash flow hedges 
valuation of deferred tax asset we compute income taxes in accordance with sfas the standard requires an asset and liability approach which results in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of those assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires the recording of a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
sfas provides for the weighing of positive and negative evidence in determining whether a deferred tax asset is recoverable 
we have incurred net operating losses in and prior years 
relevant accounting guidance suggests that cumulative losses in recent years constitute significant negative evidence  and that future expectations about income are overshadowed by such history of losses 
delays in bringing properties on to production and development cost overruns in were also significant factors considered in evaluating our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance of million as of december  we achieved profitable operations in  however the income generated in was not sufficient to overcome the negative evidence noted in the prior years 
our valuation allowance decreased during by million 
this change was a result of an increase in deferred tax assets related to foreign operations of million and a decrease in deferred tax assets related to domestic operations of million 
the change in the valuation allowance attributable to taxes recorded directly to shareholders equity was an increase of million 
additionally  the gross deferred tax asset and valuation allowances have been changed by million to reflect certain adjustments including those necessary to agree to tax returns as filed

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the interest rate paid on borrowings under the term loan 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
foreign currency risk 
the net assets  net earnings and cash flows from our wholly owned subsidiaries in the uk and the netherlands are based on the uk dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the applicable functional currency 
these foreign operations have the potential to impact our financial position due to fluctuations in the local currency arising from the process of re measuring the local functional currency in the us dollar 
we have not utilized derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge the risk associated with the movement in foreign currencies 
commodity price risk our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our term loan is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce 
we currently sell a portion of our oil and natural gas production under price sensitive or market price contracts 
we periodically use derivative instruments to hedge our commodity price risk 
we hedge a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations 
we may use futures contracts  swaps and fixed price physical contracts to hedge our commodity prices 
realized gains and losses from our price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas sales when the associated production occurs 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the unrecognized gains and losses are included as a component of other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
our internal hedging policy provides that we examine the economic effect of entering into a commodity contract with respect to the properties that we acquire 
we generally acquire properties at prices that are below the management s estimated value of the estimated proved reserves at the then current oil and natural gas prices 
we may enter into short term hedging arrangements if we are able to obtain commodity contracts at prices sufficient to secure an acceptable internal rate of return on a particular property or on a group of properties or if deemed necessary by the terms of our existing credit agreements 
during  we hedged approximately of our oil and natural gas production
