restatement of financial statements on february   the chief accountant of the us securities and exchange commission sec released a letter expressing the sec s views on certain lease accounting matters 
we have identified areas where our historical accounting practices have differed from the sec s views as to appropriate lease accounting under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we have consistently accounted for leases in accordance with our interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles and common industry practice 
however  we have restated our financial statements for prior periods to correct these errors 
we do not consider the differences in prior years financial statements to be material 
we have reviewed our property lease portfolio and adjusted initial lease terms to include option renewals that are reasonably assured of being exercised and included the straight line effect over the lease term of escalating rents during the option periods and have recognized the effect of pre opening rent holidays over the related lease terms 
we have also reviewed our leasehold improvements to ensure amortization over the shorter of their economic lives or the adjusted lease term 
tenant allowances have been reclassified from a contra asset in property and equipment  net to other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
tenant allowances have also been reclassified from a reduction of depreciation and amortization expense to a reduction of rent expense in the consolidated statements of earnings and from a reduction of capital expenditures to an increase in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal year have been adjusted for the after tax impacts of earlier periods 
while we do not consider the net dollar amounts to be material to net earnings  financial position or net cash flows for the periods presented  we believe it is appropriate to align our historical accounting results with the sec s comments on lease accounting under gaap  and we have done so  as reflected in our decision to restate results for certain prior years 
these accounting changes reduced net earnings by million and million for the fiscal years ended and  respectively  and resulted in a million reduction in retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal year see note b to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the effects of these changes on our consolidated balance sheets as of december   as well as on our consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for fiscal years and the accompanying md a gives effect to these corrections 

table of contents overview full year net earnings were higher in  compared to the previous two years 
the increase reflects a significant fourth quarter contribution from volume rebates and event based promotional incentives received from our vendors 
while we estimate these effects throughout the year  our full year contribution from these programs exceeded our earlier expectations 
we increased purchases during the fourth quarter to add inventory for early initiatives and to protect against certain anticipated product cost increases 
we do not consider these increases to be outside the normal parameters of our purchasing for these needs 
the higher purchases resulted in reaching higher volume rebate tiers with some vendors and therefore additional rebate amounts on related purchases for the year 
to the extent the additional rebates related to product sold during the year  that amount was included in fourth quarter earnings  the remaining amount was deferred in inventory 
the increase in event based support resulted from finalization of program agreements with vendors for promotional activity that occurred throughout the year 
the fourth quarter results also include charges related to actions designed to streamline operations  as well as a net benefit from the release of accruals for previously recorded uncertain tax positions based upon changes in the facts and circumstances  partially offset by taxes on the decision to repatriate some foreign earnings 
our north american retail division reported positive comparable sales in each quarter of  reversing a previous trend of consecutive quarters of decline 
the increase in sales was led by higher sales of technology products 
the overall gross profit percentage for this segment increased over  primarily from higher vendor contributions 
operating costs as a percentage of sales declined with the leverage of higher sales  payroll efficiencies and the comparison to costs incurred in to adjust closed store reserves 
our business services group again reduced the operating costs for our warehouse and delivery function  and contract sales increased  but total sales were hampered by a continued decline in catalog sales 
our international group benefited from purchasing efficiencies as a result of the guilbert acquisition  but to date we have not realized the sales growth we expected from this transaction 
we have taken specific steps to address the need to increase sales in europe  particularly in the guilbert contract sales channel 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates during also had a positive effect on reported sales and operating profit  but  of course  exchange rates are outside of our control 
in the course of our annual testing  we concluded that the goodwill balance relating to our operations in japan was unrecoverable and therefore resulted in an impairment charge in the fourth quarter 
at our corporate headquarters  our chairman and ceo resigned in october  and our board of directors is actively searching for a permanent replacement 
in the interim  veteran board member neil austrian is functioning as our chairman and ceo on an interim basis  and  among other initiatives  has approved a number of cost reduction programs 
however  a permanent ceo may alter the current strategic initiatives or effect other changes 
under mr 
austrian s leadership  our senior management team has sharpened the company s focus in several key areas 
these include expanding the contract sales teams in the us and europe  improving and expanding north american retail stores at an accelerated pace  growing our private label initiatives substantially  and implementing a key merchandising software platform 
our corporate culture  emphasizing adherence to stated core values that we have developed internally over the past several years  remains intact  but our primary emphasis is now more sharply focused on execution and accountability for results 
in many ways  has been a year of transition 
we believe the stage is set for a stronger performance in however  we must be cautious in our outlook as we face the reality of selecting and bringing on board a new ceo and ensuring that our senior management team is the right team to achieve success under new leadership  while continuing to address the many challenges that continue to face us  both in north america and internationally 
diluted earnings per share presented in accordance with gaap were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we maintain our commitment to emphasizing reported gaap based results  but we also recognize that gaap does not always provide sufficient insight into our current operations to develop expectations for future performance 

table of contents we have provided below a summary of items included in current earnings  both increases and decreases  which may help a reader of our financial statements to better understand the results of our ongoing operations 
the inclusion in this md a of this summation to a non gaap eps is not intended to imply that we consider it to be a more meaningful presentation than the actual reported amounts under gaap  but by providing the significant income statement components in one place  a reader can interpret the information that is useful for his or her purposes 
we use these non gaap numbers internally to assess the underlying business trends  while always mindful that we are accountable for the gaap based results of the company 
diluted eps gaap add deduct severance arrangements  contract terminations  and property disposition goodwill impairment litigation settlement  net bond pre payment tax rate and position changes closed store and investment adjustments cumulative effect of adopting eitf currency gain adjusted eps non gaap the choice of items involves judgment and is not intended to be exhaustive 
of particular note  however  is the impact of an operating cost review announced at the end of the third quarter and which remains ongoing 
as part of that review  over  positions were either eliminated or transferred to an outsourcing firm  resulting in severance and exit related costs in and we redeemed our highest cost debt and cancelled plans to construct a new corporate office facility  resulting in the write off of capitalized development costs 
the table above presents amounts that resulted from specific events or were otherwise considered to be noteworthy  but does not include all charges or credits related to each line item 
for example  in addition to the amounts presented  our financial results include some level of store closure costs and foreign currency gains and losses that we consider to be components of normal operations 
to make this md a more meaningful to readers  these and certain related items are discussed in the individual business segment sections below 
overall dollars in millions sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit store and warehouse operating and selling expenses segment operating profit general and administrative expenses other operating expenses operating profit our overall sales increased in following an increase of in the increase reflects higher sales in each business unit  but primarily the international group 
a full year contribution from our june acquisition of guilbert  as well as positive effects of changes in exchange rates  were the main contributors to that increase 
currency exchange rates and that acquisition also drove the increase when compared to internally  we analyze our international operations in terms of local currency performance to allow focus on operating trends and results 
comparable sales or comp sales measure the sales from stores that have been operating for one year or more 
relocated stores are excluded from the comp calculation until one year of operation in the new location 
the term is also used on an industry basis to describe contract and catalog sales  but it is most commonly used when referring to retail store sales 
we use this measure to manage 
table of contents our business and have used this term throughout md a to explain our results 
from time to time  we regroup product categories for better product management 
accordingly  comp sales reported in prior periods for certain product groupings have been adjusted to conform to current year group classifications 
our total comp sales increased in  following a decline in comp sales in north american retail increased in  after a prior year decline of 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased slightly in because of higher volume rebates and promotional incentives received from our vendors  offset in bsg by higher product cost and promotional activity  and in our international group by a higher mix of contract customers and prospecting catalogs 
at the start of fiscal year  we adopted new accounting guidance  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
as a result of this standard  we now classify amounts earned under cooperative advertising arrangements as a credit to the cost of goods sold 
previously  these amounts were classified as a reduction of advertising expense 
additionally  under this standard a portion of the amount received is deferred in inventory and reduces the cost of products as they are sold  similar to our practice for vendor rebate arrangements 
to record the initial amount of cooperative advertising deferred into inventory at the beginning of  we recorded an after tax cumulative effect adjustment of million  or per share 
the impact on continuing operations of applying this method in decreased cost of goods sold by million and increased advertising expense by million when compared to the prior accounting classification 
operating profit increased by million  net earnings by million and diluted earnings per share by 
fiscal years and are presented on a like basis  but pro forma information for is presented in the discussion of each business segment 
store and warehouse operating and selling expenses consist of personnel costs  maintenance and other facility costs  advertising expenses  delivery and transportation costs  and certain other operating and selling costs 
freight costs incurred to bring merchandise to stores and warehouses are included as a component of inventory and cost of goods sold 
warehouse costs and freight costs incurred to ship merchandise  primarily related to our delivery customers  are included in store and warehouse expenses 
because of our multi channel operations  and because some retail companies include shipping  handling and other distribution costs as a component of cost of goods sold  you should be aware that their measure of gross profit may not be comparable to ours 
total store and warehouse operating and selling expenses as a percentage of sales declined in because of operating efficiency gains in both north american retail and bsg 
severance costs  exit costs  and goodwill impairment charges are included in this line item in fiscal year includes a charge to adjust our closed store reserve 
store and warehouse operating and selling expenses in include costs associated with our settlement of certain class action litigation in the state of california involving wage and hour claims relating to whether certain employees should be classified as non exempt rather than exempt 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued a new accounting pronouncement that will require companies to expense the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
this rule will be applicable for all public companies beginning with the third quarter of because we currently provide stock options to a large number of our employees  this change could have a significant impact on our results in and beyond 
our assessment of this rule change is not yet complete  but our financial statement footnote disclosures have indicated that under one acceptable methodology for valuing stock option grants  the full year impact of expensing stock options in recent years would have reduced eps in the range of to per share 
we anticipate refining our analysis during the first half of corporate and other items not classified within our three main segments are addressed below following the discussions of segment results 
the overall results table provides a subtotal for segment operating profit 
we use this measure of performance to assess the operations of each business unit  and we believe it is useful to investors because it reflects the sales and operating expenses directly related to the segment s activities 
our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs associated with support functions 
because these functions typically support all segments of our business  we have historically not considered these costs in determining our segment profitability  but rather have applied this expense when looking at total company profitability 
other companies may charge more or less general and administrative costs to their segments  and our presentation therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by some other entities 
our measure of segment operating profit should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net earnings determined in accordance with gaap 
the table above reconciles segment operating profit to operating profit determined in accordance with gaap 

table of contents north american retail division dollars in millions sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit store and warehouse operating and selling expenses segment operating profit sales in our north american retail division increased in over the prior year  compared to a decrease of in comparable sales in from the stores that were open for more than one year increased 
in  comp sales in the stores that were open for at least one year were down 
comp sales were positive in each quarter of  reversing a trend of consecutive quarters of decline 
we completed a chain wide technology remerchandising effort during the year  which improved both the breadth of product selection and presentation 
this  plus increased promotional activity  drove significant technology sales increases 
overall  while not achieving our desired attachment rate goals  we did see improvement over last year in many categories 
the comp sales increase in reflects a higher average transaction size but fewer transactions and the decrease in reflects both lower average transaction size and fewer transactions 
we believe our sales in and part of were negatively impacted by the overall soft us economy at that time 
the overall technology products category increased in  following an decline in sales of desktops  laptops  and networking equipment were all positive in while such trends had been negative in the increase in in part reflects the remerchandising efforts in technology and increased promotional activity 
generally  technology products produce lower margin rates as a percent of sales  and those margins are reduced further by promotions  however  promotions are frequently supported by our vendors  which protects our margins 
sales of supplies remained flat in  with higher ink and toner sales offset by lower paper sales 
the furniture and low tech category comp sales declined  but margin contribution was positive  reflecting increased margin rates for each sub group in this category 
during  we launched our advantage customer loyalty program and enrolled almost two million customers by year end 
merchandise costs associated with this program are included in cost of goods sold 
overall segment gross margin increased for the year  primarily from additional volume rebates and promotional support received from our vendors  particularly in the fourth quarter of the year 
also during  we expanded our selection of private label brands 
we currently offer in our stores and catalogs over  private label stock keeping units  or skus  and expect to expand this offering in the future 
during  we opened stores that we acquired from toys r us 
the acquisition has provided us access to markets in the northeast region of the us where we were under represented in retail 
an additional stores from the acquisition will be opened during we expect to open a total of new stores during and remodel about existing locations 
all of these stores will be opened or remodeled using the m design  which we believe shoppers find more appealing than previous formats 
we adopted eitf at the beginning of this accounting change reclassified cooperative advertising payments received from our vendors from a reduction of advertising expense to a reduction of product cost  primarily cost of goods sold 
had this change been effective for  the pro forma impact on the north american retail division would have decreased cost of goods sold by million and increased advertising expense by million 
total operating and selling expenses as a percent of sales decreased basis points in  largely the result of leverage from additional sales and a broad based focus on operating expenses 
payroll cost reductions reflect a shift towards a higher percentage of part time employees and an average reduction in per store headcount 
severance related costs of approximately million were incurred in to reduce staffing and streamline operations 
advertising expenses decreased as a percent of sales but increased in dollars  reflecting additional newspaper inserts  direct mail and the launch of our customer loyalty program 
other operating costs in include the impact of new stores and remerchandising efforts  partially offset by lower bank and credit fees 
during  increases in wage rates and in certain employee benefit costs were more than offset by streamlining certain operational processes and by reduced incentive costs 
facility expense increased in as we added stores and made changes to our store layout 
during  we conducted a comprehensive review of our closed store commitments and recorded a million charge to terminate some obligations and adjust the remaining commitments to current market values 
we recorded similar charges in of 
table of contents million 
additionally  charges for asset impairments for under performing stores were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
we regularly review actual and projected store performance and record any asset impairment charges as a component of store and warehouse operating expenses 
operating and selling expenses in also included million to settle potential class action litigation in the state of california relating to certain employee classifications as exempt from overtime 
business services group dollars in millions sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit operating and selling expenses segment operating profit sales in our bsg segment increased in and in sales in our contract channel increased in both and contract sales in the eastern us have outperformed those in the western us  primarily because of weak economic conditions in the west 
the increase in reflects revenue growth in most customer segments  with the national account segment growing at faster rates than the other account segments 
total direct sales office depot catalog  viking catalog and tech depot were slightly positive in  but sales in the catalog channel decreased in both and comparable sales of office supplies  the largest category in bsg s sales mix  increased in and in higher paper costs and promotional activity negatively impacted gross profit in  partially offset by higher vendor rebates 
furniture and low tech category sales increased in after declining in we earn higher gross profit percentages in our bsg segment than in our north american retail division  principally because of lower occupancy costs and a sales mix that includes less technology products 
we adopted eitf at the beginning of had this change been effective for  the pro forma impact would have decreased bsg s cost of goods sold in that year by million and increased advertising expense by million 
in early  we reorganized our contract sales force  with a greater emphasis on generating new accounts and increasing penetration of existing accounts 
in late  we began adding contract sales representatives to drive penetration in existing markets and to expand into new markets 
we expect these additional representatives to accelerate sales in during  we decided to consolidate our call centers from locations to three and outsource certain activities  a process we expect to be completed by the third quarter of we incurred approximately million of severance and other exit related costs during and expect to incur million of severance and exit costs in related to this consolidation and outsourcing 
we expect significant savings from these initiatives in catalog advertising expense decreased in as we eliminated certain unproductive programs  and bad debt expense declined because of improved systems and processes  and greater collaboration between our contract sales force and our credit management function 
operating and selling expenses as a percent of sales continued to decline in as compared to  a comparable trend that spans consecutive quarters 
in  we realized additional benefits from optimizing our delivery model by using a more cost effective blend of company owned and third party carriers 
in  call center consolidation contributed to lower personnel related costs  and the introduction of new technologies streamlined operations and reduced delivery costs by 

table of contents international group dollars in millions sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit operating and selling expenses segment operating profit sales in our international group grew in and in in local currencies  sales grew in and in  though those increases primarily reflect the acquisition of guilbert in mid year other than guilbert  the growth in local currency sales was strongest in the united kingdom  while sales declined in germany and japan in both and the integration of guilbert continues 
integrating the sales force was more challenging than anticipated  and the post acquisition sales performance has been below our expectations 
we have strengthened the contract management team across europe and continue investing in the sales force 
currency adjusted  sales contribution across all channels strengthened over the second half of the year  with four months of successive overall international group sales improvement 
retail stores reported positive comp sales throughout  although they make up less than of our total sales mix 
during  we acquired elso iroda superstore kft in hungary  which included three stores and a contract sales business that formerly operated as office depot businesses under a licensing agreement 
we opened an additional store in hungary in and will look for opportunities to expand our presence in eastern europe 
we also opened four stores in france and seven stores in japan  and closed one store in spain 
in addition to our acquisition of guilbert in  we initiated contract operations in germany in january and launched our retail business in spain in march in  we opened three stores in france and had a net increase of five stores in japan 
in  we added catalog operations in three countries  increased the size of our contract sales force in four countries  initiated contract sales in italy  added a net of seven new stores in france  and launched nine new web sites 
we expect to continue to grow all sales channels in our european operations 
we adopted eitf at the beginning of had this change been effective for  the pro forma impact on our international group would have decreased cost of goods sold by million and increased advertising expense by million 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased in both and considering the pro forma impact of eitf  reflecting a higher mix of lower margin contract sales from the addition of guilbert  and to a lesser extent  the increased distribution of prospecting catalogs which feature lower priced products in europe to support growth into new markets and increased customer acquisition in established markets 
also  the change in reflects margin pressures in both the catalog and contract channels related to paper and ink and toner 
since mid  the decrease has been partially offset by lower net product costs from increased vendor purchasing discounts achieved with higher volume following the guilbert acquisition 
operating and selling expenses as a percentage of sales have been higher in our international group than in our other segments  primarily because of expansion activities  and in and  costs related to acquisition integration activities 
during  we realigned a portion of our sales force throughout europe and decided to relocate a warehouse in france to improve customer service at lower costs and recognized million of related severance and moving costs 
the new warehouse began fulfilling orders in november we also recognized a million gain from the favorable settlement of certain claims related to our distribution network 
as our operations grow in a particular market  fixed operating expenses decline as a percent of sales 
for example  advertising costs in the form of prospecting and delivery costs  which are affected by the density of the delivery areas  decline as a percentage of sales as our operations in a given market grow 
during  as a result of our customary fourth quarter impairment analysis  we made a determination that the goodwill balance existing in our japanese reporting unit was impaired 
in recent years  several initiatives were put in place in efforts to improve the profitability of this business  including streamlining from two brands to one brand  consolidating warehouses  and improving retail assortment and layout 
however  the anticipated improvements have been less than expected  and we have recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to zero 
we continue our efforts to improve the sales performance and profit of our japanese operations 

table of contents as noted above  sales in local currencies have substantially increased in recent years 
for us reporting  these sales are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates experienced during the year 
international group sales were positively impacted by foreign exchange rates in by million  in by million and in by million 
international group segment operating profit also benefited from foreign exchange rates by million in  by million during and by in future volatility in exchange rates could affect translated sales and operating profit of our international group operations 
in  we sold our operations in australia with no significant impact on earnings 
the australian business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation 
corporate and other other operating expenses other operating expenses primarily reflect pre opening expenses and  in  costs related to the integration of guilbert 
pre opening expenses consist of personnel  property and advertising expenses incurred in opening or relocating stores and customer service centers cscs 
we typically incur pre opening expenses during a six week period prior to a store opening  but the period was longer in for some of the stores acquired in the transaction with toys r us 
because we expense these items as they are incurred  the amount of pre opening expenses each year is generally proportional to the number of new stores and cscs opened during the period 
on a world wide basis  we opened or relocated stores in  in  and in we relocated one csc in europe during and expect to complete another relocation during we opened three cscs in for  our pre opening expenses were approximately  per domestic office supply store and  per international office supply store 
our cost to open a new csc varies significantly with the size and location of the facility 
we estimate pre opening costs to open a domestic or international csc to be approximately million per facility 
in  we incurred approximately million of non capitalizable integration costs in connection with our acquisition of guilbert in june these costs primarily related to professional consulting fees for assistance with integration  management  internal communications plans  and human resource aspects of the acquisition 
general and administrative expenses dollars in thousands general and administrative expenses percentage of sales our general and administrative g a expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs associated with global support functions 
because these functions typically support all segments of our business  we have not considered these costs in determining our segment profitability 
the increase during includes a full year of guilbert related g a expenses  as well as the impact of translating all international g a expenses at higher exchange rates 
the increase as a percentage of sales  however  reflects the write off of costs associated with terminating plans for a new corporate office site  dispute resolutions  executive severance following the departure of our chairman and ceo  exit costs associated with corporate staff reductions  additional professional fees to comply with new legislation requiring additional documentation of controls over financial reporting  and corporate systems enhancements 
the increase in reflects the mid year acquisition of guilbert  the impact of exchange rates on other international expenses  and costs relating to finance  human resources and merchandising software applications 
employee related costs declined in because of lower performance based compensation  partially offset by higher costs for healthcare and other employee benefits 
the comments above and in the overall section of this md a describe how our management has historically presented our g a expenses 
other companies may charge more or less g a expenses and other costs to their segments  and our results therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 

table of contents other income and expense dollars in thousands interest income interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt miscellaneous income  net interest income increased in  reflecting higher average cash and cash equivalent balances and higher interest based investment yields 
the decrease in reflects lower interest rates and lower cash balances for part of the year following the acquisition of guilbert in mid the increase in interest expense over the three year period ended in results from the change in borrowings outstanding by period 
fiscal year includes interest on a full year of million in senior notes that were issued in august at an effective interest rate of  essentially a full year of interest on the million in senior subordinated notes with an effective interest rate of that were redeemed in december  a full year of interest on approximately million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  as well as interest expense on capital leases 
interest expense also includes accretion on lease obligations for stores closed before the end of  the accrued lease obligations totaled million at december  following a change in accounting rules  accretion on lease obligations for stores closed after january is included as a component of operating expenses 
in december  we redeemed the entire issue of the million senior subordinated notes  pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the subordinated notes indenture 
the payment of approximately million included the principal  accrued interest to the termination date  and contractual interest  discounted at the appropriate us treasury rate plus basis points 
the net loss on extinguishment of debt of million included the make whole payment  removal of deferred issuance costs  and recognition of a previously deferred gain related to an interest rate swap 
our net miscellaneous income expense consists of equity in the earnings of our joint venture investments  royalty and franchise income  and realized gains and impairments of other investments 
our equity method investments are non controlling interests in office supply selling operations outside of the united states and canada 
earnings from these investments increased million in in  we sold or abandoned a majority of our interest in certain internet companies  resulting in a fourth quarter charge of million 
in we recorded charges of million related to the impairment of these investments 
in  this category also included recognition of approximately million of net foreign currency gains  primarily resulting from holding euro investments in anticipation of purchasing guilbert in june income taxes dollars in thousands income taxes effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate in has been affected by four significant factors an million tax expense related to the anticipated repatriation of foreign earnings  an million tax benefit from reducing existing valuation allowances on deferred tax assets  settlements of tax audits of million  and a release of previously recorded accruals for uncertain tax positions based on changes in the facts and circumstances 
the american jobs creation act was passed by congress and signed into law in this act allows a one time reduction in us federal taxes on repatriated earnings of foreign affiliates 
we have decided to repatriate at least million of foreign earnings and have recognized the incremental us tax expense 
we have not yet decided whether to repatriate any additional amounts 
should we decide to bring additional foreign earnings back to the us during  our tax expense will increase accordingly 
because of a projected increase in taxable income of certain international entities  and a reassessment of certain state tax circumstances  we changed our assessment of the need for the valuation allowances on the related deferred tax assets 
tax expense was reduced because we now believe the related tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized 

table of contents the consolidated effective income tax rate has decreased over the three years presented  reflecting an increasing proportion of international activity  which is generally taxed at lower effective tax rates and  in  realization of certain state tax credits 
the effective tax rate in future periods can be affected by variability in our mix of income and tax rates in the various jurisdictions and therefore may be higher or lower than it has been over the past three years 
currently  we are in the final stages of completing routine taxing authority examinations of certain earlier tax years 
resolution of these examinations for amounts other than those that we have reserved as probable exposures will impact tax expense in future periods 
we are a multi national corporation engaged in complex business  legal and tax transactions in various countries 
our current effective tax rate is dependent in part upon both agreements with taxing authorities in a number of jurisdictions and tax filing positions taken in various jurisdictions  which tax filing positions we believe to have been taken in good faith and to be well founded based upon our understanding of the applicable tax codes 
our agreements with tax authorities and our tax filing positions are subject to ongoing review by us and by various taxing authorities 
a material change in any of our agreements with taxing authorities  or a successful challenge to any one or more of our tax filing positions  could have a material impact on our overall corporate tax rate  causing this rate to be higher or lower than the current tax rate 
in  we anticipate resolution of various issues pertaining to certain tax agreements and or tax filing positions in various taxing jurisdictions  which could result in a higher effective tax rate 
such change in our tax rate could be material 
we have made no determination at this time as to whether there will definitely be a change in our tax rate  the magnitude of any such change in our tax rate or the impact on future periods from any such change 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized as follows dollars in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities we have consistently satisfied operating liquidity needs and planned capital expenditure programs through our normal conversion of sales to cash 
over the three years ended in  we generated over billion of cash flows from operating activities 
at december   we had over million available under our revolving credit facility  and incurred no new borrowings under this program during this year  in spite of significant outflows for investing and financing activities 
our major sources of cash from operations include store sales  a majority of which are generated on a cash and carry basis  our private label credit card program  which is administered by a third party financial services company and converted to cash daily  and collection of our receivables 
we generate receivables from our contract and certain direct mail customers  and as we expand this business here and abroad  we anticipate our accounts receivable portfolio will grow 
additionally  amounts due us under rebate  cooperative advertising  and other programs with our vendors comprised over of total receivables at the end of and  respectively 
these receivables tend to fluctuate seasonally growing during the second half of the year and declining during the first half  because certain collections do not occur until specified milestones are reached or the program year is complete 
these receivables  however  are typically high quality and are collected quickly after reaching specified milestones 
our primary outflow of cash from operations is the purchase of inventory  net of customary credit arrangements with vendors  operational costs such as payroll and rent  and the payment of current taxes 
cash flows provided by operating activities in decreased as compared to the change reflects the comparison to higher non cash charges in from inventory obsolescence and adjustment to our closed store reserves  offset by lower working capital needs in the increase in accounts payable and inventory at year end reflects the addition of new stores during the fourth quarter  as well as an addition to inventory for anticipated first quarter needs 
accounts receivable balances increased because of a increase in fourth quarter sales for compared to  as well as an increase in receivables from vendors 
the increased volume of purchases finalized at the end of the year  along with the increase in promotional activity contributed to the increase in receivables from our vendors compared to for compared to  the decrease in current liabilities reflects payments on closed store liabilities  accrued employee compensation  and settlement of accrued expenses  as well as the timing of year end purchases and vendor payments 
the increase in inventories reflects lower than expected sales in our north american retail division during the fourth quarter  and an intentional 
table of contents build up of certain products to support the holiday season and  our new retail merchandising initiatives 
the non cash operating items primarily include an increase in our deferred income tax expense  an increase in our closed store reserve  and various asset impairments 
the additional depreciation includes the impact of acquiring guilbert assets 
investing activities during  we invested million in capital expenditures 
this activity includes the opening  relocating and remodeling of retail stores worldwide  as well as opening one customer service center in europe 
the capital expenditures in north america include million to buy retail store locations from toys r us 
the original transaction included store locations

we also acquired retail stores in hungary that had operated as office depot stores under separate licensing agreements 
investing activities for include approximately million for payments made in connection with our acquisition of guilbert  net of cash acquired 
see note d to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the purchase transaction 
investing activities in and also include million and million  respectively  invested in a mutual fund that primarily invests in us government agency obligations 
we currently plan to open stores in our north american retail division including the stores discussed above and approximately five to ten stores in our international group during we estimate that our cash investing requirements will be approximately million for each new domestic office supply store 
the million includes approximately million for leasehold improvements  fixtures  point of sale terminals and other equipment  and approximately million for the portion of our inventories that will not be financed by our vendors 
in addition  our average new office supply store requires pre opening expenses of approximately million 
we also anticipate remodeling approximately retail locations during at an average cost of  per location 
financing activities our existing credit agreement is a million year unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility  which includes up to million available for standby and trade letters of credit 
this facility runs through march upon mutual agreement  the maximum borrowing may be increased to million 
the agreement provides borrowings up to the total amount in us dollars  british pounds  euro  or yen 
we may elect interest periods of one  two  three  six  nine or twelve months 
interest is based on the london interbank offering rate libor  plus a spread determined at the time of usage

at december   we had approximately million of available credit under our revolving credit facility  which covers million outstanding letters of credit 
we had an additional million of letters of credit outstanding under a separate trade agreement 
in december  we redeemed the entire issue of our million senior subordinated notes  pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the subordinated notes indenture 
the payment of approximately million included the principal  accrued interest to the termination date  and contractual interest  discounted at the appropriate us treasury rate plus basis points 
the redemption resulted in a fourth quarter charge of million which included the make whole payment  removal of deferred issuance costs  and a previously deferred gain related to an interest rate swap 
the charge is reported as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the other income expense  net section of the consolidated statements of earnings 
in august  we issued million of senior notes due august these notes are not callable and bear interest at the rate of per year  to be paid on february and august of each year 
the notes contain provisions that  in certain circumstances  place financial restrictions or limitations on us 
simultaneous with completing the offering  we liquidated a treasury rate lock 
the proceeds of million are being amortized over the term of the notes  reducing the effective interest rate to 
during  we entered into a series of fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on the million of senior notes 
the swaps qualify for shortcut hedge accounting and no ineffectiveness has been recognized 
we are in compliance with all restrictive covenants included in the above debt agreements 
the office depot board of directors has approved two common stock repurchase plans  both of which were in effect during in  the board approved an annual share repurchase plan  subject to their annual review  of up to million per year until cancelled by the board 
under this plan  we purchased million shares in  at a cost of million  million shares in  for million  and million shares in  for million 

table of contents in september  the board of directors authorized an additional million common stock repurchase program to be completed over the following to months 
the million annual purchases in each of and that would be available under that program are included in this million program 
at december   approximately  shares have been repurchased for million under this program 
during  we exercised our option and redeemed all of the outstanding shares of convertible subordinated notes  originally issued in and the shares were redeemed at original issue price plus accrued interest  totaling million 
we continually review our financing options 
although we currently anticipate that we will fund our operations  expansion and other activities through cash on hand  funds generated from operations  property and equipment leases and funds available under our credit facilities  we will continue to consider alternative financing as appropriate for market conditions 
we have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock 
while our board of directors regularly assesses our dividend policy  there are no current plans to declare a dividend

our operating lease obligations are described in note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that are enforceable and legally binding on us that meet any of the following criteria they are noncancelable  we would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled  or we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services

this caption primarily consists of our net long term deferred income taxes  the unfunded portion of the guilbert pension plans  deferred lease credits  and liabilities under our deferred compensation plans 
these liabilities have been excluded from the above table as the timing and or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain 
see note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred tax positions and note j for a discussion of our employee benefit plans  including the guilbert pension plans and the deferred compensation plan 

table of contents in addition to the above  we have letters of credit totaling million outstanding at the end of the year  and we have recourse for private label credit card receivables transferred to a third party 
we record a fair value estimate for losses on these receivables in our financial statements 
the total outstanding amount transferred to a third party at the end of the year was approximately million 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ie  gaap 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates 
some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have also identified certain accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and we have provided below additional information on those policies 
vendor arrangements each year  we enter into purchase arrangements with our vendors which provide for certain payments  including rebates  to be paid to our company by certain vendors  that we generally refer to as vendor programs 
these arrangements typically fall into two broad categories  with some underlying sub categories 
the largest category is volume based rebates 
generally  our product costs per unit decline as higher volumes of purchases are reached 
many of our vendor agreements provide that we pay higher per unit costs prior to reaching a predetermined milestone  at which time the vendor rebates the per unit differential on past purchases  and also applies the lower cost to future purchases until the next milestone is reached 
current accounting rules provide that companies with a sound basis for estimating their full year purchases  and therefore the ultimate rebate level  can use that estimate to value inventory and cost of goods sold throughout the year 
we believe our history of purchases with many vendors provides us with a sound basis for using such an estimation process 
however  if the anticipated volume of purchases is not reached  or if we form the belief in any given point in the year that it is not likely to be reached  cost of goods sold and the remaining inventory balances are adjusted to reflect that change in our outlook 
we review sales projections and related purchases against vendor program estimates at least quarterly and adjust these balances accordingly 
while vendor rebates are recognized throughout the year based on judgment and estimates  the final amounts due from vendors are generally known soon after year end 
substantially all vendor program receivables outstanding at the end of the year are collected within the three months immediately following year end 
we believe that our historic collection rates against vendor programs provides a sound basis for our estimates of anticipated vendor payments throughout the year 
we also have arrangements with our vendors that are event based 
these arrangements can take many forms  but two primary types cover i reimbursement for our advertising sometimes referred to as cooperative or co op advertising and ii specific promotional activities 
prior to  the co op advertising reimbursements were classified as a reduction of advertising expense for the period 
with our adoption of eitf at the beginning of  cooperative advertising arrangements are classified as a reduction of product costs  reducing costs of goods sold and inventory 
see note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of adopting eitf other types of event based arrangements include special pricing offered by certain of our vendors for a limited time  payments for special placement or promotion of a product  reimbursement of costs incurred to launch a vendor s product  price protection  and various other special programs 
such special programs are often associated with a vendor s decision to launch a new product  or in some cases to  discontinue a given product or product line 
these payments are classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold or inventory  as appropriate for the program 
additionally  we receive payments from vendors for activities that lower the vendor s cost of product shipment 
such receipts are recognized as a reduction of our cost of goods sold 
agreements reached with vendors generally cover one year  but vendor program and cooperative advertising arrangements can change between years 
these arrangements can be influenced by increases or reductions in inventory purchases compared to company plans and programs offered by the vendors 
while there are long standing volume and pricing conventions in the office products industry  such program arrangements are regularly renegotiated  and as such  are subject to change 
if these vendor program arrangements were materially less beneficial  we could either increase the selling price of the vendor s product  which may impact sales volume  or experience a decline in profitability 
we recognize the area of vendor programs as an area in which there are opportunities for abuse by either vendors or our own employees 
in recent years  other retailers have experienced issues and abuses in this area 
we have taken various steps to ensure that our own vendor programs are operated as honestly and appropriately as possible  including extending our code of ethical behavior to our vendors  and use of our internal audit resources to ensure that we are diligent in policing the operation of vendor programs by our own employees 
we are aware of reported abuses at other retailers  and when these come to our attention  we direct our internal resources towards ensuring that the particular reported abuses are the focus of our attention 
inventory valuation our selling model is predicated on the breadth and availability of our product assortment  and our profitability is dependent on high inventory turnover rates 
our merchants monitor inventory on hand by location  particularly as it relates to trailing and projected sales trends 
once a product has been identified for discontinuance  we record a charge to reduce the carrying value to our assessment of the lower of cost or market 
this assessment is based on the quality of the merchandise  the rate of sale  and our assessment of market conditions 
additional cost adjustments and sales markdowns will be taken as considered appropriate until the product is sold or otherwise disposed 
estimates and judgments are required in determining what items to stock and at what level  and what items to discontinue and how to value them prior to sale 

table of contents goodwill testing under accounting rules that became effective at the beginning of fiscal  goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment 
absent any circumstances that warrant testing at another time  this is customarily done as part of our year end closing process 
our testing consists of comparing the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units to their carrying amounts  including recorded goodwill 
we estimate the fair values of each of our reporting units by discounting their projected future cash flows 
our projections are based on the budget for the succeeding year and multi year forecasts 
developing these future cash flow projections requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates regarding the sales  gross margin and operating expenses of our reporting units  as well as economic conditions and the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
should future results or economic events cause a change in our projected cash flows  or should our operating plans or business model change  future determinations of fair value may not support the carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units  and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable 
any such write down would be included in the operating expenses of the business unit 
the performance of our business in japan in did not meet the assumptions used in the prior year s testing of goodwill 
this under performance  combined with the decline in our future expectations for certain initiatives put in place in and  caused us to record an impairment charge relating to japan s goodwill 
closed store reserves and asset impairments we assess on a regular basis the performance of each retail store against historic patterns and projections of future profitability 
these assessments are based on management s estimates for sales growth  gross margin attainments  and cash flow generation 
if  as a result of these evaluations  management determines that a store will not achieve certain targets  the decision may be made to close the store 
when the decision is made to close a store  and the store is no longer used for operating purposes  we recognize a liability for the remaining costs related to the property  reduced by an estimate of any sublease income 
the calculation of this liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the remaining term of the lease including vacancy period  anticipated sublease income  and costs associated with vacating the premises 
with assistance from independent third parties  we periodically review these judgments and estimates and adjust the liability accordingly 
in  as a result of a detailed portfolio review and changes in commercial real estate markets where we have lease commitments  we increased our liability for closed stores by million 
future fluctuations in the economy and the market place demand for commercial properties could result in material changes in this liability 
costs associated with facility closures are included in store and warehouse operating expenses 
in addition to the decision about whether or not to close a store  store assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability of their carrying amounts 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates of a store s future cash flows 
new stores may require two or more years to develop a customer base necessary to achieve expected cash flows and we typically do not test for impairment during this early stage 
however  if in subsequent periods  the anticipated cash flows of a store cannot support the carrying amount of the store s assets  an impairment charge is recorded to operations as a component of operating and selling expenses 
to the extent that management s estimates of future performance are not realized  future assessments could result in material impairment charges 
income taxes income tax accounting requires management to make estimates and apply judgments to events that will be recognized in one period under rules that apply to financial reporting and in a different period in the company s tax returns 
in particular  judgment is required when estimating the value of future tax deductions  tax credits  and net operating loss carryforwards nols  as represented by deferred tax assets 
some tax credits and nols may expire before they can be used and certain deductions by jurisdiction may not meet the recognition standard 
accordingly  to the extent that we believe the recovery of all or a portion of a deferred tax asset is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
generally  changes in judgments that increase or decrease these valuation allowances impact current earnings 
when we acquired guilbert  we recorded valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets related to their existing nols because of the uncertainty of their realization 
should we be able to realize a tax benefit from these deferred tax assets  the benefit would reduce goodwill  rather than affect current earnings 
in addition to judgments associated with valuation accounts  our current tax provision can be affected by our mix of income and identification or resolution of uncertain tax positions 
because income from domestic and international sources may be taxed at different rates  the shift in mix during a year or over years can cause the effective tax rate to change 
we base our rate during the year on our best estimate of an annual effective rate  and update those estimates quarterly 
we also regularly evaluate the status and likely outcome of uncertain tax positions 
we file our tax returns based on our best understanding of the appropriate tax literature 
however  complexities in the rules and our operations  as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required 
we generally maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed 
table of contents by the taxing authority  available review periods expire  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount 
the financial accounting standards board has indicated that they will be reviewing the accounting for uncertain tax positions and may issue new or revised accounting rules during we believe our current processes are consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
significant trends  developments and uncertainties over the years  we have seen continued development and growth of competitors in all segments of our business 
in particular  mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs have increased their assortment of home office merchandise  attracting additional back to school customers and year round casual shoppers 
we also face competition from other office supply superstores that compete directly with us in numerous markets 
this competition is likely to result in increased competitive pressures on pricing  product selection and services provided 
many of these retail competitors  including discounters  warehouse clubs  and even drug stores and grocery chains  carry at least limited numbers of basic office supply products  including ink and toner cartridges  printer paper and other basic supplies 
some of them have also begun to feature technology products 
many of them price certain of these offerings lower than we do  but they have not shown an indication of greatly expanding their somewhat limited product offerings at this time 
this trend towards a proliferation of retailers offering a limited assortment of office products is a potentially serious trend in our industry 
we have also seen growth in competitors that offer office products over the internet  featuring special purchase incentives and one time deals such as close outs 
through our own successful internet and business to business web sites  we believe that we have positioned ourselves competitively in the e commerce arena 
another trend in our industry has been consolidation  as competitors in the superstores channel and the copy print channel have been acquired and consolidated into larger  well capitalized corporate conglomerates 
this trend towards consolidation  coupled with acquisitions by financially strong organizations  is potentially a significant trend in our industry 
we regularly consider these and other competitive factors when we establish both offensive and defensive aspects of our overall business strategy and operating plans 
market sensitive risks and positions we have market risk exposure related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
we manage the exposure to market risks at the corporate level 
the portfolio of interest sensitive assets and liabilities is monitored and adjusted to provide liquidity necessary to satisfy anticipated short term needs 
the percentage of fixed and variable rate debt is managed to fall within a desired range 
our risk management policies allow the use of specified financial instruments for hedging purposes only  speculation on interest rates or foreign currency rates is not permitted 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on cash equivalents and debt obligations 
the impact on cash and short term investments held at the end of from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would be a decrease in interest income of approximately million in market risk associated with our debt portfolio is summarized below dollars in thousands carrying fair risk carrying fair risk value value sensitivity value value sensitivity million senior subordinated notes million senior notes revolving credit facility including current maturities 

table of contents the risk sensitivity of fixed rate debt reflects the estimated increase in fair value from a basis point decrease in interest rates  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
the sensitivity of variable rate debt reflects the possible increase in interest expense during the next period from a basis point change in interest rates prevailing at year end 
in  we entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements to receive fixed and pay floating rates  converting the equivalent of million of this portfolio to variable rate debt through foreign exchange rate risk we conduct business in various countries outside the united states where the functional currency of the country is not the us dollar 
our expansion in europe and our acquisition of guilbert in june increased the proportion of our operations in countries with euro and british pound functional currencies 
the recent weakening of the us dollar compared to other currencies  primarily the euro and british pound  has positively impacted our results by increasing reported sales and operating profit  however  a strengthening of the us dollar will adversely impact our results 
while we look for opportunities to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation against the us dollar  at this point we have determined not to pursue translation hedging opportunities generally 
as of december   a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in our operating profit of approximately million 
although operations generally are conducted in the relevant local currency  we are also subject to foreign exchange transaction exposure when our subsidiaries transact business in a currency other than their own functional currency 
this exposure arises primarily from a limited amount of inventory purchases in a foreign currency 
foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain inventory exposures were million at their highest point during generally speaking  we view our international businesses internally by focusing on the local currency results of the business  and not with regard to the translation into us dollars  as the latter is generally beyond our control 
a comparative view of the results of our international operations is most meaningful  in our view  by a focus on the comparative results in local currencies 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation on our business  we do not believe inflation has a material impact on our sales or the results of our operations 
we consider our business to be only somewhat seasonal  with sales in our north american retail division and business services group slightly higher during the first and third quarters of each year  and sales in our international group slightly higher in the first and fourth quarters 
new accounting standards in march  emerging issues task force issue no

revised  share based payment  fas r 
this statement requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees 
currently  companies are required to calculate the estimated fair value of these share based payments and can elect to either include the estimated cost in earnings or disclose the pro forma effect in the footnotes to their financial statements 
we have chosen to disclose the pro forma effect 
the fair value concepts were not changed significantly in fas r  however  in adopting this standard  companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions 
the valuation model and amortization assumption we have used continues to be available  but we have not yet completed our assessment of the alternatives 
fas r  will be effective for our company beginning with the third quarter of transition options allow companies to choose whether to adopt prospectively  restate results to the beginning of the year  or to restate prior periods with the amounts that have been included in their footnotes 
we have not yet concluded on which transition option we will select

 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp  was issued in december this fsp provides guidance on accounting for special reductions in taxes included in the american jobs creation act of in particular  the act allows a one time decrease in us taxes on repatriated foreign earnings 
fsp clarifies that a company s consideration of the act does not overrule their prior contention that the foreign earnings were permanently reinvested 
also  the fsp indicates that companies should provide tax expense when a decision is made to repatriate some or all foreign earnings  and provide disclosure about the possible range of repatriation if the analysis is not yet complete 
we have decided to repatriate at least million of foreign earnings during and have provided approximately million of tax expense in we continue to assess whether additional earnings will be repatriated

cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of cautionary statements in december  the private securities litigation reform act of the act was enacted by the united states congress 
the act  as amended  contains certain amendments to the securities act of and the securities exchange act of these amendments provide protection from liability in private lawsuits for forward looking statements made by public companies under certain circumstances  provided that the public company discloses with specificity the risk factors that may impact its future results 
we want to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
in doing so  we have disclosed these forward looking statements by informing you in the following specific cautionary statements of certain circumstances which may cause the information in these statements not to transpire as expected 
this annual report contains both historical information and other information that you can use to infer future performance 
examples of historical information include our annual financial statements and the commentary on past performance contained in our md a 
while we have specifically identified certain information as being forward looking in the context of its presentation  we caution you that  with the exception of information that is clearly historical  all the information contained in this annual report should be considered to be forward looking statements as referred to in the act 
without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence  any time we use the words estimate  project  intend  expect  believe  anticipate  continue and similar expressions  we intend to clearly express that the information deals with possible future events and is forward looking in nature 
certain information in our md a is clearly forward looking in nature  and without limiting the generality of the preceding cautionary statements  we specifically advise you to consider our md a in the light of the cautionary statements set forth herein 
forward looking information involves risks and uncertainties  including certain matters that we discuss in more detail below in this report on form k 
much of the information in this report that looks towards future performance of our company is based on various factors and important assumptions about future events that may or may not actually come true 
as a result  our operations and financial results in the future could differ materially and substantially from those we have discussed in the forward looking statements in this report 
in particular  the factors we discuss below could affect our actual results and could cause our actual results in and in future years to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by us or on our behalf in this report 
we believe that the following risk factors should be considered by persons reading any part of this report on form k  and we hereby expressly qualify this report and future filings with the sec unless and until we modify these cautionary statements in a future filing by the inclusion of these cautionary statements regarding future performance competition retail we compete with a variety of retailers  dealers and distributors in a highly competitive marketplace that includes such competitors as high volume office supply chains so called office supplies superstores  warehouse clubs  computer stores  contract stationers and well established mass merchant retailers 
even grocery and drug store chains have begun to carry at least limited supplies of basic office supplies and technology items  including printer supplies such as ink cartridges and toner cartridges 
while most of these retailers  other than the office supplies superstores  have not yet elected to carry the broad range of skus that our company carries in its various channels of distribution  many of them have elected to carry the most popular and fastest selling items  often selling those limited skus at highly competitive prices relative to the prices at which our company sells its products 
well established mass merchant retailers have the financial and distribution ability to compete very effectively with us should they choose to enter more broadly into the office superstore retail category  internet office supply or contract stationer business or substantially expand their offering in their existing retail outlets 
in addition  there is substantial competition on the internet from other merchants who may or may not have a brick and mortar presence 
there is a possibility that any or all of these competitors could become more aggressive in the future  thereby increasing the number and breadth of our competitors  potentially having a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations 

table of contents competition contract and direct we compete with a number of contract stationers  mail order and internet operators and retailers who supply office products and services to large and small businesses  both nationally and internationally  by selling on a contract basis to such businesses  as well as offering products through the convenience of catalog and internet channels 
in order to achieve and maintain expected profitability levels in this segment and as a company  we must continue to grow this segment of our business by adding new customers and taking market share from competitors  while maintaining the service levels and aggressive pricing necessary to retain existing customers 
there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to expand our contract and direct business while retaining our base of existing customers  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
we are also working on various initiatives to improve margin levels in this business segment by growing the percentage of small to medium sized businesses and by increasing our presence in terms of the numbers of sales representatives we use to call on customers  but there is no assurance that these initiatives will prove successful 
some of our competitors operate only in the contract and or direct channels and therefore may be able to focus more attention on the business services segment  thereby providing formidable competition 
our failure to adequately address this segment of our business could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to these competitors 
in addition  we are near maximum capacity in some of our distribution centers that serve our contract and direct customers  which may impede our ability to efficiently grow our business in certain markets 
the economic problems of the past several years have had an adverse impact on a number of our contract and direct customers  resulting in some cases in cutbacks in expenditures of our existing customers for office supplies and other items we sell to them 
competition consolidation the past year has seen movements to consolidate certain aspects of the competitive landscape  including the entry of new and well funded competitors in certain aspects of our business 
for example  two major common carriers of goods have either completed or are in the process of completing acquisitions of retail outlets that will allow them to compete directly for copy  printing  packaging and shipping business 
this is a material part of our business  and presents a new competitive challenge to us 
in addition  two of our major competitors  one in the retail segment and the other in the contract and commercial business  have merged to form a new and potentially more formidable competitive presence  capable of competing in a more unified manner than was the case when these companies were separate entities 
competition international in  we acquired a large contract stationer in europe  guilbert  sa  and thereby increased the significance of our european operations in many of the major commercial centers of europe  including the uk however  the landscape in europe remains highly competitive in all the channels in which we compete 
many of the same competitors we face in north america have established major operations in europe 
historically  europe has been our fastest growing business geography  and we have enjoyed excellent margins in that area 
as competition increases in europe  both from traditionally aggressive european companies  and the increased presence of us and other international multi national competitors  we will be challenged to maintain both our growth rates and our margins in europe 
these pressures could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
internet as mentioned above  many internet based merchandisers also compete with us 
while this industry segment has recently sustained somewhat slower growth rates than in previous years  the remaining competitors in the internet only segment are substantially stronger and better able to compete than was necessarily the case in the past 
the stronger competitors have established strong distribution capabilities and are formidable competitors to the more traditional brick and mortar office supplies superstores 
this competition may increase in the future as the companies that have survived the shakeout in the internet segment continue to expand their operations 
in addition  certain manufacturers of computer hardware  software and peripherals  including certain of our suppliers  have expanded their own direct marketing of products  particularly over the internet 
the largest manufacturer of personal computers is also now the largest direct seller of such products over the internet  along with the attendant accessories and supplies 
in addition to selling technology hardware  some of these manufacturers have also begun to expand their offerings to include machine supplies  such as ink and toner 
the number of these direct sellers has increased in recent years 
even as we expand our own internet efforts  our ability to anticipate and adapt to the developing internet marketplace and the capabilities of our network infrastructure to efficiently handle our rapidly expanding operations are of critical importance 
failure to execute well in any of these key areas could have a material adverse effect on our future sales growth and profitability 
execution of expansion plans we plan to open approximately stores in the united states and canada and approximately to stores in our international group during we consider our retail expansion program to be an integral part of our plans to achieve anticipated operating results in future years 
circumstances outside our control  such as adverse weather conditions affecting 
table of contents construction schedules  unavailability of acceptable sites or materials  labor disputes and similar issues could impact anticipated store openings 
at times in the past  our expansion activities have been hampered by sometimes poor selection of real estate locations  resulting in some stores that have failed to meet their planned financial results 
our future expansion plans also include opening retail stores of different sizes than our traditional superstore models and using different store formats and layouts 
we have also considered opening a retail presence within other retailer s locations  utilizing so called stores within stores 
we cannot determine with certainty whether these newly sized or formatted stores will be successful 
the failure to expand by opening new stores as planned and or the failure to generate the anticipated sales growth in markets where new stores are opened including the opening of new sizes and formats of stores could have a material adverse effect on our future sales growth and profitability 
during  we agreed to purchase stores from toys r us  with the expectation of opening approximately of these as office depot stores and selling the others 
by the end of  we had removed several stores from the transaction by mutual agreement  sold several properties and opened office depot stores in these locations  others will be opened during with this purchase  we gained access to markets in the mid atlantic states and the northeast corridor of the united states  areas where we previously were under represented in retail 
many of the locations that we expect to open as office depot retail stores will face strong competitive pressures 
throughout their useful lives  these retail locations must generate operating cash flows that are at least sufficient to recover the remaining book value of the initial purchase price and related capitalized and operating costs 
should these stores fail to meet future cash flow expectations  the carrying value of the stores and related assets may need to be written down 
if required  such a write down could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
also  we have estimated the selling value and holding costs of stores that will not be opened as office depot stores 
if we are unsuccessful in disposing of these locations as quickly as anticipated or at price levels that we expect  we may be required to adjust their carrying value which could have an adverse impact on our reported results in the period of adjustment 
cannibalization of sales in existing office depot stores as we expand the number of our stores in existing markets  pursuing a fill in strategy that is both offensive and defensive in nature  sales in our existing stores may suffer from cannibalization as customers of our existing stores begin shopping at our new stores 
our new stores typically require an extended period of time to reach the sales and profitability levels of our existing stores 
moreover  the opening of new stores does not ensure that those stores will ever be as profitable as existing stores  particularly when new stores are opened in highly competitive markets or markets in which other office supply superstores may have achieved first mover advantage 
our comparable sales are affected by a number of factors  including the opening of additional office depot stores  the expansion of our contract business in new and existing markets  migration of our customers from the retail channel to other channels  including our own internet  direct and contract channels  competition from other office supply chains  mass merchandisers  warehouse clubs  computer stores  other contract stationers and internet based businesses  and regional  national and international economic conditions 
in addition  our profitability would be adversely affected if our competitors were to attempt to capture market share by reducing prices 
any or all of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated future revenue and profitability models 
costs of remodeling and re merchandising stores the remodeling and re merchandising of our stores has contributed to increased store expenses  and these costs are expected to continue impacting store expenses throughout and beyond 
while a necessary aspect of maintaining a fresh and appealing image to our customers  the expenses associated with such activities could have a significant negative impact on our net income in the future 
in addition  there is no guarantee that these changes will generate any of the benefits that we have anticipated 
furthermore  our growth  through both store openings and acquisitions  will continue to require the expansion and upgrading of our informational  operational and financial systems  as well as necessitate the hiring of new managers at the store and supervisory level 
as mentioned in our md a  we adopted a new retail format that we call m 
at the end of  we have opened or remodeled stores to the m design 
if we are unsuccessful in achieving an acceptable roi on this design  such failure could have a material adverse effect on our future sales growth and profitability 
historical fluctuations in performance fluctuations in our quarterly operating results have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
a variety of factors could contribute to this quarter to quarter variability  including new store openings which require an outlay of pre opening expenses  generate lower initial profit margins and cannibalize existing stores  timing of warehouse integration  competitors pricing  changes in our product mix  fluctuations in advertising and promotional expenses  the effects of seasonality  acquisitions of contract stationers  competitive store openings  an increase in activity by non traditional resellers of office supplies  technology or other products we sell  or other events 
such quarterly fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and or the price of our securities 

table of contents international activity we have operations in a number of international markets 
we intend to enter additional international markets as attractive opportunities arise 
each entry could take the form of a start up  acquisition of stock or assets or a joint venture or licensing arrangement 
we have made a decision to accelerate our growth in europe  increasing more rapidly than originally planned the number of countries in which we operate 
in addition to the risks described above in our domestic operations and the increased level of competition in europe and elsewhere  internationally we face such risks as foreign currency fluctuations  unstable political and economic conditions  and  because some of our foreign operations are not wholly owned  compromised operating control in certain countries 
recent world events have served to underscore even further the risks and uncertainties of operating in other parts of the world 
risks of civil unrest  war and economic crisis in portions of the world outside north america in which we operate represent a more significant factor than may have been the case in the past 
also  we have experienced significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in  including large swings in the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro and the dollar and the pound sterling during the prior year  which affected the sales and earnings in our international group 
our results may continue to be affected by these fluctuations  both positive and negative  in the future as the value of the us dollar changes against other currencies 
all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or our results from operations 
moreover  as we increase the relative percentage of our business that is operated globally  we also increase the impact these factors have on our future operating results 
our operation in japan  in particular  has proven to be disappointing to date and has generated losses that have materially affected our financial results in the past and may do so in the future 
because of differing commercial practices  laws and other factors  our ability to use the internet and electronic commerce to substantially increase sales in international locations may not progress at the same rate as in north america 
integration of guilbert in europe in june  we completed the acquisition of guilbert  sa  a leading contract stationer in europe and formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of the ppr group in france 
in addition to the risks associated with making such a large investment nearly billion in us dollars at year end exchange rates  we also faced a formidable challenge in the integration of the guilbert organization into our european office depot and viking businesses 
we appointed new country managers in nearly every country in which we operate in europe 
some of these managers came from the guilbert organization and some from the office depot viking organization 
failures of any of these managers to adapt to a new culture and the challenges in most cases of managing substantially larger businesses in their respective countries could have a material impact on our results of operations in europe 
to date  results have been mixed and in some cases have not met our expectations 
in addition to the merger of somewhat different cultures  we also faced the challenges of physically integrating facilities from both the former guilbert side of the business and the former office depot viking side of the business 
the integration process continues 
to the extent that we close or consolidate additional facilities  we are likely to face high social costs associated with such moves  and the possibility of work stoppages in the form of strikes in some locales in europe 
any or all of these integration issues could have a material impact on our future financial performance and results of operations 
global sourcing of products private label in recent years  we have substantially increased the number and types of products which we sell under our own office depot  viking  guilbert  niceday and other private label brands 
we expect this trend to continue and even accelerate in the future 
we source many of these products from outside the united states  particularly in the far east 
while these products have attractive margins and may enhance our brand image  the increased reliance on foreign sourced products introduces its own set of risks and uncertainties 
sources of supply may prove to be unreliable  or the quality of the globally sourced products may vary from our expectations 
unlike the situation with our traditional suppliers  when we source in this manner  we must bear the risks and uncertainties of warranty  product liability and intellectual property issues 
economic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source such products  as well as shipping and dockage labor issues could adversely impact the availability or cost of such products  or both 
moreover  while we seek indemnities from the manufacturers of these products  the uncertainty of realizing on any such indemnity and the lack of understanding of us product liability laws in certain parts of the far east make it more likely that we may have to respond to claims or complaints from our customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products 
in addition  while the initial margins on such products are generally more attractive than we can achieve by sourcing from traditional sources of supply  other factors  such as the lack of vendor program income  including cooperative advertising contributions  may make such sourcing less attractive in the future 
any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance in the future 

table of contents sources and uses of cash we believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents  future operating cash flows  lease financing arrangements and funds available under our credit facilities and term loans should be sufficient to fund our planned expansion  integration and other operating cash needs for at least the next year 
however  there can be no assurance that additional sources of financing will not be required during the next twelve months as a result of unanticipated cash demands  opportunities for expansion  acquisition or investment  changes in growth strategy  changes in our warehouse integration plans or adverse operating results 
we could attempt to meet our financial needs through the capital markets in the form of either equity or debt financing 
alternative financing will be considered if market conditions make it financially attractive 
there can be no assurance that any additional funds required by us  whether within the next twelve months or thereafter  will be available to us on satisfactory terms 
our inability to access needed financial resources could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operating results 
m a activity in  we made a major investment in the growth of our business in europe through the acquisition of guilbert  sa from the ppr group  at a cost of almost billion us dollars at year end exchange rates 
this acquisition occurred five years after our previous major acquisition of viking in other than these two acquisitions  we have limited our merger and acquisition activity to relatively small acquisitions 
however  as we seek ways to more aggressively expand and grow our business  we may need to increase our level of m a activity  both domestically and internationally 
while the opportunities from such activity cannot be ignored  neither can the clear reality that many acquisitions do not measure up to the expectations of the acquiring company for a host of reasons 
moreover  m a activity may divert attention of our executive management team away from our existing core businesses 
we may do a less than optimal job of due diligence or evaluation of target companies  and  as always  the task of integrating substantial businesses can prove difficult 
failure to grow our businesses through m a activity  or failure to execute m a activity in a satisfactory manner  as well as adding substantial leverage to our balance sheet in order to accomplish major acquisitions  could have a significant and material adverse effect on our future business prospects and or our financial performance in the future 
effects of certain charges from time to time in the past  we have recorded charges and credits to adjust past estimates  such as facility closure costs  to reflect current conditions 
there can be no assurance that additional charges of this nature will not be required in the future as well 
in particular  we expect that a retail store chain  such as our north american retail division  should expect to close a certain number of stores each year  while remodeling and or relocating a number of other stores 
we cannot be certain that our decisions to close  remodel and or relocate stores will have the desired favorable results on our financial performance  nor can we anticipate the size and nature of charges associated with such matters 
moreover  an increase in m a activity increases our exposure to having to take such charges  as we learn more about the acquired entity and reach conclusions to consolidate  etc 
that may or may not have been contemplated at the time of acquisition 
such charges  if any  could have a materially adverse impact on our financial position or operating results in the future 
impact of new legislation and new accounting rules since  our company  along with other publicly held companies  has worked diligently to comply with new legislation that has been called the most comprehensive set of reforms of public companies in over a half century  the sarbanes oxley act of soa 
moreover  the implementation of various mandates under soa has resulted in the promulgation of a host of new regulations by the securities and exchange commission sec and the public company accounting oversight board 
during  substantial costs have been incurred  and will continue to be incurred to comply with various of these mandates  including the engagement of separate public accounting firms to perform work that is now prohibited to be performed by our regular independent accounting firm  internal costs associated with documenting the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and similar compliance activities  and increased costs of audit by our independent accounting firm 
while office depot believes that it has been at all times in material compliance with laws and regulations pertaining to the proper recording and reporting of our financial results  there can be no assurance that future regulations  implementing soa and otherwise  will not have a material adverse impact on our reported results as compared with prior reporting periods 
any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our reported financial results 

table of contents of current note  the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued several new accounting standards and is considering others  some of which could have a material impact on our reported results 
in particular  beginning with the third quarter of  all public companies will be required to record an expense associated with the estimated fair value of stock options issued to employees 
in the past  this information has been disclosed on a pro forma basis in the notes to our financial statements  but not recorded 
the disclosure indicated that expensing the fair value of stock options would have reduced annual diluted earnings per share in the range of to per share 
the fasb has an active agenda of items to consider  several of which also could have a significant impact on the reported financial results and financial condition of the company 
issues being considered that could affect us include accounting for income taxes  revenue recognition and business combinations  to name a few 
also  all public companies are required to assess the continuing value of goodwill and long lived assets 
this assessment requires judgment and estimates about future cash flows  which may or may not be realized 
changes in facts or assumptions could cause the write down or write off of long lived assets or goodwill associated with our operations 
for example  the carrying value of goodwill relating to our investment in japan was written down in the impact of any required write off of goodwill associated with any units of our company could have a material adverse impact on our reported financial results in future periods 
office depot is confident that our past practices and reports filed with the sec  the new york stock exchange and other reports are in material compliance with all laws and regulations  but the continued obligation to further enhance disclosures and make filings that increase the transparency of our reported results will undoubtedly add to the overall cost of doing business 
and some of the many proposed changes in accounting policies and principles could dramatically alter the reported results of our company  as contemplated by at least certain currently pending proposals among various regulatory bodies 
executive management our former chairman and chief executive officer resigned his positions in october that role is being filled currently by a member of the company s board of directors  neil r 
austrian  while a search for a permanent replacement is conducted 
it is possible that the search process for a new ceo may take longer than currently anticipated 
it is also possible that an extended delay in identifying and recruiting a new ceo may have an adverse impact on the performance of our company 
further  it is possible that during a period of uncertainty while the recruiting process is underway  certain other senior executives may elect to depart the company  resulting in the necessity of filling other senior level managerial positions 
even if they do not elect to leave the company  their performance may suffer during the interim period  due to lack of focus on operating matters 
such departures or lack of management focus  if any  could also have an adverse impact on the performance of our company 
possible changes to our global tax rate our company is a multi national  multi channel reseller of office products 
as a result of our operations in many foreign countries  in addition to the united states  our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
depending upon the sources of our income  any agreements we may have with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  and the tax filing positions we take  our overall tax rate may be lower or higher than that of other companies 
our overall tax rate is dependent upon numerous factors  any one or more of which may change from time to time  resulting in a change in our overall tax rate that could be material 
because income from domestic and international sources may be taxed at different rates  the shift in mix during a year or over years can cause the effective tax rate to change 
we base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time upon a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our company and to estimates of the amount of business likely to be done in any given geography 
we update those estimates quarterly 
we also regularly evaluate the status and likely outcome of uncertain tax positions 
the loss of one or more agreements with taxing jurisdictions  a change in the mix of our business from year to year and from country to country  or changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate could result in a favorable or unfavorable change in our overall tax rate  which change could be material to our reported financial results 
disclaimer of obligation to update we assume no obligation and specifically disclaim any such obligation to update these cautionary statements or any other forward looking statements contained in this annual report to reflect actual results  changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such forward looking statements
