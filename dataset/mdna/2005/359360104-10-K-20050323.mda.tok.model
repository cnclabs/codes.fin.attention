item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are principally a motor carrier  also commonly referred to as a trucking company 
we offer various transportation services to customers in the united states  canada and mexico 
all of our services involve the over the road movement of freight 
in the united states  we sometimes also arrange for the use of railroads to transport our loaded trailers between major cities 
most of our revenue is from service which is order based  meaning that we separately bill our customers for each shipment 
a minority of our revenue is from services which are asset based  meaning that we bill our customer for the use of a truck and driver for a period of time  without regard to the number of shipments hauled 
we also refer to our asset based service as dedicated fleets  because in these arrangements  the trucks and drivers involved are dedicated for use by a specific customer on a full time basis 
order based services are either full truckload or less than truckload ltl 
our trailers are designed to carry up to  pounds of freight 
shipments weighing  pounds or more are full truckload  while shipments of less than that amount are classified as ltl 
customers let us know that they have shipments requiring transportation and inform us as to any special requirements  such as an identification of the type of product to be shipped  the origin and destination of the load and the expected time by which delivery must occur 
we inform our customers of our availability to haul the freight and of the price we will charge 
if these fit with the needs of the customer  we schedule the freight for pickup 
shipments have three stages pick up  linehaul and delivery 
the linehaul stage is over the road and involves longer distances 
most of our full truckload shipments will have all of these stages performed by the same truck 
ltl shipments typically involve different trucks for each of the three stages 
for ltl  the linehaul stage may also involve more than one truck as the freight moves among our network of ltl terminals 
for example  an ltl truck bound from los angeles to dallas may carry shipments destined for dallas  chicago and atlanta 
once the truck arrives in dallas  the freight for chicago and atlanta will be sorted and sent out from dallas on different trucks to those cities with other ltl shipments that originated in dallas or arrived there on trucks from other areas of the country 
a linehaul load of ltl typically weighs  to  pounds and is comprised of between and individual shipments 
we operate under three primary brand names  ffe transportation services ffe  lisa motor lines lml and american eagle lines ael 
ffe and lml specialize in products that require temperature control 
most shipments require the maintenance of a cold temperature ranging from minus degrees to plus degrees fahrenheit 
examples include perishable food  beverages  candy  pharmaceuticals  photographic supplies and electronics 
other products require maintenance of a warm temperature in the colder months to prevent freezing while in transit  such as nursery stock and liquid products 
ffe conducts all of our ltl business and also has significant order based and asset based full truckload operations 
lml specializes in order based full truckload operations 
ael serves the market for order based and asset based full truckload activities that do not require temperature control 
the assets we must have for temperature controlled service are costly to acquire and maintain 
the rates we charge for our temperature controlled services are usually higher than other companies who offer no temperature controlled services 
many products that require protection from the heat during the warmer months of the year do not require protection during the colder months 
therefore  during the warmer months  demand for our temperature controlled full truckload and ltl services expands 
there are several companies that provide national temperature controlled full truckload services 
we know of no other company providing nationwide ltl temperature controlled service 
the vast majority of trucking companies that are nationwide in scope  like our ael brand  offer only full truckload service with no temperature control 
therefore  the markets that are served by ael tend to be very price competitive and generally lack the level of seasonality as in our ffe and lml operations 
because consumer demand for products requiring temperature control is often less sensitive to economic cycles  revenue from ffe and lml tends to be less volatile during such cycles 
during  our ltl linehaul revenue increased by over the prior year  after declines during the years leading up to the increase was a result of our principal national temperature controlled ltl competitor having ceased operations 
we do not believe that the market for refrigerated ltl services improved significantly in general since  but we do believe that the level of our specific operations improved because of the reduction in capacity in the marketplace 
accordingly  ltl linehaul revenue increased by just during as compared to  more in line with historic patterns 
page of 
table of contents over the past few years  ael has been the fastest growing of our brands  and accounted for of our revenue from full truckload linehaul services 
much of what ael hauls are products the demand for which exhibits more fluctuation with economic activity 
clothing  electronics  beauty supplies  hygiene products and household appliances are principal among ael s freight 
as consumer demand for such products improved during  much of our revenue growth from our full truckload activities was from ael 
full truckload revenue from our temperature controlled brands also increased during  but to a lesser extent than was the case for ael 
the trucking business is highly competitive 
during  the last year for which data is available  there were several thousand companies operating in all sectors of the trucking business in the united states 
among those  the top five companies offering primarily temperature controlled services collectively generated revenue of billion 
the next such companies collectively generated revenues of billion 
in  we ranked third in terms of revenue generated among all temperature controlled motor carriers 
we have nearly  active customers for our trucking business 
we generally collect cash for our services between and days after our service is provided 
trucking companies of our size face challenges to be successful 
costs for labor  maintenance and insurance rise every year 
fuel prices can increase or decrease quite rapidly 
due to the high level of competitiveness  it is difficult to pass these rising costs on to our customers 
over the past few years  many trucking companies have ceased operations  resulting in a reduced number of alternatives and increasing the awareness among customers that price increases for trucking services are likely 
throughout  we more aggressively sought and obtained price increases from our customers 
these efforts will continue into and beyond 
we also have a non freight business  airpro holdings  inc  airpro that deals in vehicle air conditioning components and compressors for use in stationary refrigeration equipment  such as grocery store coolers and freezers 
during through  we incurred substantial losses in this business 
in late  the president of our non freight subsidiary was replaced with a specialist in the management and turn around of troubled companies 
we have taken significant measures to reduce the cost of operating this business and focused on opportunities to restore our non freight operations to profitability 
during  airpro reported an operating profit of  critical accounting policies and estimates we have several of critical accounting estimates 
these require a more significant amount of management judgement than the other accounting policies we employ 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue and expense recognition in our freight operations  which accounted for of our consolidated revenue  we recognize revenue and estimated direct operating expenses such as fuel and labor on the date we receive shipments from our customers 
in  the emerging issues tax force eitf of the financial accounting standards board promulgated issue  revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process eitf 
in  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides that eitf sets forth the revenue and expense recognition methods that may be used in our industry 
according to eitf  our manner of recognizing revenue and expenses for freight in process is acceptable 
the other methods generally defer the recognition of revenue and expenses to as late as the date on which delivery of the shipments is completed 
we have consistently utilized our manner of revenue and expense recognition since we began operations in because our consolidated financial statements contain accruals for revenue and associated estimated direct expenses as of the beginning and the end of each reporting period  we believe that if we were to change our manner of recognizing revenue and associated estimated direct expenses to one of the other methods allowed by eitf  our results of operations would be substantially unaffected 
in such an event  each period s revenue and expenses would be adjusted to include in revenue amounts from freight in process at the beginning of the period and to exclude from revenue those amounts from freight in process at the end of the same period 
we believe that these amounts would essentially offset one another from period to period  resulting in minimal impact to our revenue or our operating or net income 
personal and work related injury the trucking business involves risk of injury to our employees and the public 
prior to  we retained the first  and million of these risks  respectively  on a per occurrence basis 
due primarily to conditions in the insurance marketplace  in and  we retained the first million for work related injuries and the first million for public liability risk 
this arrangement continued during the first six months of during mid  our retention for public liability claims was lowered to million but we share equally with the insurer losses from liability claims between million and million 
we are fully insured above that million level to a policy limit of million 
page of 
table of contents because of our large public liability and work related injury retentions  the potential adverse impact a single occurrence can have on our results is significant 
when an event involving potential liability occurs  our internal staff of risk management professionals estimates the range of most probable outcomes 
based on that estimate  we record a reserve in our financial statements during the period in which the event occurred 
as additional information becomes available  we increase or reduce the amount of this reserve 
we also maintain additional reserves for public liability and work related injury events that may have been incurred but not reported 
as of december   our reserves for personal injury  work related injury  cargo and other claims against us aggregated nearly million 
if we were to change our estimates making up those reserves up or down by in the aggregate  the impact on net income would have been million  and net income per share of common stock would have been impacted by 
estimate of uncollectible accounts we extend trade credit to our customers 
we also establish a reserve to represent our estimate of accounts that will not ultimately be collected 
once we conclude that a specific invoice is unlikely to be paid by the customer  we charge the invoice against the reserve 
we estimate the amount of our bad debt reserve based on the composite age of our receivables 
during  the amount of our bad debt reserve increased by million and the amount of receivables that were more than days old increased by million 
significant changes in our receivables aging could impact our profits and financial condition 
as of december   our reserve for uncollectible accounts was million 
if our estimate were to change by  net income would have been impacted by  or per share of common stock 
deferred taxes our deferred tax liability of million is stated net of offsetting deferred tax assets 
the assets consist of anticipated future tax deductions for items such as for insurance and bad debt expenses which have been reflected on our statements of income but which are not yet tax deductible 
in total  our deferred tax assets are about million 
at current federal tax rates  we will need to generate about million in future taxable income in order to fully realize our deferred tax assets 
we believe it probable that we will generate sufficient taxable income in and beyond to the remainder of our deferred tax assets 
if our expectation of such realizability diminishes  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance on our balance sheet 
that could diminish our net income in future periods 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation to employees based on the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  if the exercise price of employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date  no compensation expense is recorded 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

had we used sfas no 
to account for our stock based compensation for  and  our net income  would have been   and  respectively  less than our reported results 
the impact on our diluted per share earnings for  and would have been  and  respectively 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
r also supersedes apb  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
under sfas no 
r  companies must calculate and record in the income statement the cost of equity instruments  such as stock options  awarded to employees for services received 
pro forma disclosure is no longer permitted 
the cost of the equity instruments is to be measured based on the fair value of the instruments on the date they are granted and is required to be recognized over the period during which the employees are required to provide services in exchange for the equity instruments 
sfas no 
r is effective in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  sfas no 
r provides two alternatives for adoption i a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of this statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date or ii a modified retrospective method permits entities to restate prior periods to record compensation cost calculated under sfas no 
for the pro forma disclosure 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
since we currently account for stock options granted to employees and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plans in accordance with the intrinsic value method permitted under apb opinion no 
 no compensation expense is currently recognized 
if we continue to issue stock options to our employees  the adoption of sfas no 
r could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
r cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as it will depend on the market value and the amount of share based awards granted in future periods 
had we adopted sfas no 
r in a prior period  the impact would approximate the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
page of 
table of contents sfas no 
r also requires that tax benefits received by companies in excess of compensation cost be reclassified from operating cash flows to financing cash flows in statements of cash flows 
this change in classification will reduce cash flows from operating activities and increase cash flows from financing activities in the periods after adoption 
while the amount of this change cannot be estimated at this time  the amount of cash provided by operating activities from such stock based compensation related tax deductions was  during and  during no such transactions occurred during results of operations freight revenue our freight revenue is derived from five types of transactions 
linehaul revenue is order based and earned by transporting cargo for our customers using tractors and trailers that we control by ownership  long term leases or by agreements with independent contractors sometimes referred to as owner operators 
within our linehaul freight service portfolio we offer both full truckload and less than truckload services 
over of our ltl linehaul shipments must be temperature controlled to prevent damage to the cargo 
we operate fleets that focus on refrigerated or temperature controlled less than truckload ltl  full truckload temperature controlled shipments and on full truckload non refrigerated or dry shipments 
of the shipments transported by our temperature controlled fleets during  about were of dry commodities 
our freight brokerage provides freight transportation services to customers using third party trucking companies 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we had reported freight brokerage s revenue net of the purchased transportation expense paid to such third parties 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we revised amounts previously reported by reclassifying the related purchased transportation expense as an operating expense for all prior periods 
the reclassification  which increased freight revenue and operating expenses by million and million for and  respectively  and million during the first nine months of had no impact on the amount of or the trends displayed regarding our operating income  net income  cash flows  or financial position for any period 
our dedicated fleet operation consists of fleets of tractors and trailers that haul only freight for a specific customer 
dedicated fleet revenue is asset based 
customers typically pay us weekly for trucks assigned to their service 
income from equipment rental represents amounts we charge to independent contractors for the use of trucks which we own and lease to the owner operator 
the rates we charge for our services include fuel adjustment charges 
in periods when the price we incur for diesel fuel is high  we raise our prices in an effort to recover this increase from our customers 
the opposite is true when fuel prices decline

ltl linehaul revenue for the years ended december  and increased by million and million  respectively  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
for decades  most of the market for nationwide temperature controlled linehaul ltl service had been shared between alterman transport lines atl and ourselves 
we competed primarily on price and breadth of service 
in recent years  atl s annual ltl revenue was about half as much as our ltl revenue 
during december of  atl announced that it planned to cease operations and liquidate  a process that began in january of as a result  during and  we experienced a significant increase in our volume of ltl shipments as compared to the sharp increase in our ltl activities caused us to re deploy some of our vehicles from primarily hauling full truckload freight to ltl 
that has resulted in a somewhat diminished rate of growth for our full truckload revenue 
ltl operations offer the opportunity to earn higher revenue on a per mile and per hundredweight basis than do full truckload operations  but the level of investment and fixed costs associated with ltl activities significantly exceed those of full truckload activities 
accordingly  as ltl revenue fluctuates  many costs remain fixed  leveraging the impact from such revenue fluctuations on our operating income 
during and  as ltl activity and revenue rose  many ltl related costs remained static 
during  ltl linehaul revenue increased by million to million  despite a decline in the number of ltl shipments 
the average weight of such shipments increased by 
the remainder of s increase in ltl revenue is a result of rate increases we implemented during the year 
we continuously assess the performance of our ltl operations 
as a result  we periodically alter the frequency at which we service locations where freight volumes have declined and change the mix of our company operated vs 
independent contractor provided trucks in order to more closely match our operating costs to the level of our ltl revenue

at december   our entire ltl fleet consisted of tractors  as compared to at the end of and at the end of when the level of our ltl activity increases during peak times of the year  we often re deploy full truckload trucks to handle the overload 
at the end of  our full truckload fleet numbered  trucks  as compared to  at the end of and  at the end of primarily due to the increased number of trucks  the number of linehaul full truckload shipments rose by during and in  in each case when compared to the immediately preceding year 
the number of trucks in our full truckload company operated fleet rose by to  during as of december   there were  tractors in our full truckload company operated fleet  as compared to  at the end of continued emphasis will be placed on improving the efficiency and the utilization of our fleets through enhanced driver training and retention  by reducing the percentage of non revenue producing miles  by extending the average loaded miles per shipment and through expansion of dedicated fleet operations 
our full truckload fleets use satellite technology to enhance efficiency and customer service 
location updates of each tractor are provided by this network and we exchange dispatch  fuel and other information with the driver by way of satellite 
effective january  the federal agency that regulates motor carrier safety began to enforce new hours of service hos rules  which limit the number of hours truck drivers may work in a shift and drive in a shift 
time in a shift spent by a driver in fueling  loading and waiting to load or unload freight count as non driving work hours 
the old hos rules were introduced in  and the new rules are intended by the government to reflect more closely the equipment and roads in use today  as compared to sixty five years ago 
the new rules generally expand from ten to eleven the number of hours that a person can drive an over the road truck in a shift  but reduce from fifteen to fourteen the number of hours such a person can work during the same shift 
also  under the old hos rules  time spent in the middle of a shift waiting to load or unload did not count as hours worked  but such time does count as hours worked under the new hos rules 
the new rules also extend from eight to ten the number of hours that drivers must rest between on duty shifts 
in order to compensate our drivers and offset other expenses from diminished asset utilization  we are seeking compensation from our customers  such as rate increases and detention fees 
such detention fees are designed to motivate our customers to expedite the loading and unloading of their freight  thereby maximizing the number of hours that our drivers can drive during a work shift 
page of 
table of contents freight operating expenses changes in the proportion of revenue from full truckload versus ltl shipments  as well as in the mix of company provided versus independent contractor provided equipment and in the mix of leased versus owned equipment  contribute to variations among operating and interest expenses 
the following table sets forth  as a percentage of freight revenue  certain major operating expenses for each of the years in the three year period ended december  salaries  wages and related expenses purchased transportation fuel supplies and expenses revenue equipment rent and depreciation claims and insurance other total freight operating expenses salaries  wages and related expenses salaries  wages and related expenses increased by million during and million during  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
the following table summarizes and compares the major components of these expenses for each of the years in the three year period ended december  in millions amount of salaries  wages and related expenses attributable to driver salaries and per diem expenses non driver salaries payroll taxes work related injuries health insurance and other employee full truckload linehaul drivers are typically paid a certain rate per mile 
the number of such miles increased during and  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
the increased number of miles contributed to the increases in driver salaries and per diem expenses during both and employee dedicated fleet drivers are typically paid by the hour or by the day 
during and  we added trucks to our dedicated fleet operations 
those increases also contributed to increases in driver salaries and per diem expenses 
also impacting of the and increases in driver salaries and per diem expenses were changes in the level of shipments  miles and hundredweight in our ltl operation 
drivers hauling ltl typically earn a higher wage than do the full truckload counterparts 
ltl wages are based on a number of factors including the amount of on duty time  miles driven  hundredweight hauled and in route stops to load and unload freight 
during and  respectively  ltl miles increased  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
at the same time  hundredweight transported also increased 
the number of ltl shipments increased significantly during  but did not change appreciably during to the extent that ltl freight is hauled by employee drivers  as opposed to owner operators  the aforementioned changes served to increase ltl driver salaries  wages and per diem expenses during and  respectively  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
we sponsor bonus and incentive programs for our employees and management 
bonus payments are based on the operating profitability of our company 
no bonuses were paid based on our or results 
for  due to improved performance  our employees and management earned bonuses aggregating approximately million  which contributed to the increase in non driver salaries expense 
page of 
table of contents we also sponsor a k wrap plan which enables employees to defer a portion of their current salaries to their post retirement years 
because the wrap plan s assets are held by a grantor or rabbi trust  we are required to include the wrap plan s assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   such assets included  shares of our common stock  which are classified as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to value the assets and liabilities of the wrap plan at market value on our periodic balance sheets  but we are precluded from reflecting the treasury stock portion of the wrap plan s assets at market value 
this results in upward pressure on non driver salaries and wage expense  when the market value of our common stock rises 
the opposite is true when our common stock price falls 
during  the per share market price of our stock increased by  to 
this contributed approximately  to s non driver salary and wage expense 
also  our executive incentive and bonus plan is partially denominated in approximately  phantom shares of our stock  the liability for which is also determined by the value of our stock 
that resulted in an additional  of non driver salaries and wage expense during compared to s deferred compensation expense of million  such expenses were million during and were of a negligible amount during the expanded level of our ltl activities resulted in the need to employ more dispatchers  supervisors and marketing and customer service personnel 
during december of  we opened two additional terminals to handle the increasing number of ltl shipments 
this  coupled with annual payroll adjustments for our non driver employees were the principal contributors to s higher level of non driver salaries and related payroll taxes 
costs associated with work related injuries diminished by during as compared to and increased by in as compared to self insured work related injuries incurred by drivers are the primary contributors to this expense 
the number of our employee drivers did not change appreciably during but increased by during we share the cost of health insurance with our employees 
for the past several years  we have experienced double digit percentage health insurance cost increases 
during mid  we changed to a plan that increased both the amounts employees pay to participate and the amount of medical costs that must be borne by our employees 
this helped us mitigate the rate at which our costs have increased 
during non recessionary economic periods  we typically have difficulty attracting qualified employee drivers for our full truckload operations 
such shortages increase costs of employee driver compensation  training and recruiting 
significant resources are continually devoted to recruiting and retaining qualified employee drivers and to improving their job satisfaction 
as the economy softened during and  previous shortages of qualified drivers diminished  but as the economy improved during we began to experience more difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified employee drivers 
during the latter half of and the first two months of  the supply of qualified drivers continued to tighten 
with increasing frequency and magnitude  our competitors often increase their employee driver pay scales 
we monitor such events and consider increases should the need arise 
the last such increase we implemented was during purchased transportation purchased transportation expense increased by million during and million during  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
the following table summarizes our purchased transportation expense for each of the years in the three year period ended december   by type of service in millions amount of purchased transportation expense incurred for full truckload linehaul service ltl linehaul service intermodal total linehaul service fuel adjustments freight brokerage and other page of 
table of contents of the increase in purchased transportation expense  million  million and million  respectively  were attributable to linehaul services  fuel adjustment charges and our freight brokerage 
of the increase  such categories of purchased transportation accounted for million  million and million respectively 
the amount of purchased transportation for ltl equipment increased by nearly a third during that was a result of s sharp increase in our ltl shipment count and revenue 
during  the growth of our ltl operation returned to more historic levels of between and annually 
the dramatic increase in the quantity of our ltl revenue and shipments during was a result of a major competitor having ceased operations during the first quarter of we run our ltl service on schedules  much like an airline 
when terminal departure times arrive  our ltl trucks depart  whether or not they are fully loaded 
the only other major nationwide provider of refrigerated ltl service ceased operations in early that event resulted in the sharp increase in ltl shipments  but much of that increase was handled by trucks from our fleets that were already providing the scheduled service 
because we already had excess capacity in our ltl operation  we were able to service much of the increased freight with equipment that was already present in our fleet 
in addition  much of the increased ltl volume during was handled by our fleet of company operated ltl trucks  which increased substantially during also  the amount of ltl freight transported by owner operator provided trucks which normally haul full truckload shipments temporarily increased significantly during independent contractor equipment generated  and of our full truckload linehaul revenue during  and  respectively 
independent contractors provide a tractor that they own to transport freight on our behalf 
during each of the past three years  between and of our ltl linehaul revenue was generated by independent contractor equipment 
contractors pay for the cost of operating their tractors  including but not limited to the expense of fuel  labor  taxes and maintenance 
we pay independent contractors amounts generally determined by reference to the revenue associated with their activities 
at the beginning of  there were such tractors in the full truckload fleet 
by the end of  there were such tractors 
at december  and  there were and  respectively 
as the number of these trucks fluctuates  so does the amount of revenue generated by such units 
in providing our full truckload linehaul service  we often engage railroads to transport shipments between major cities 
in such an arrangement called intermodal service  loaded trailers are transported to a rail facility and placed on flat cars for transport to their destination 
on arrival  one of our company operated or independent contractor provided tractors will pick up the trailer and deliver the freight to the consignee 
intermodal service is generally less costly than using one of our own trucks for such movements  but other factors also influence our decision to utilize intermodal services 
during  the number of intermodal full truckload shipments increased by  as many of our normally full truckload trucks were occupied in handling ltl freight 
these factors contributed to our increase of intermodal services in the transport of full truckload freight 
when fuel prices escalate  as they have during through  we add fuel adjustment charges to the rates we bill to our customers 
independent contractors are responsible for payment for the fuel used by their trucks in transporting freight for our customers 
for shipments that are transported by independent contractors  we pass through to the contractor any fuel adjustments charges that are to be paid to us by the customer 
this practice added million million and million  respectively  to our purchased transportation expense during   and respectively 
from through  we have significantly expanded the scope of our freight brokerage  which enables us to better adjust our capability to transport loads offered to us but for which we have no available equipment 
when we book an order in our brokerage  we arrange for an unaffiliated licensed trucking company to haul the freight 
we set the price to be paid by the customer and bear the risk should the customer fail to pay us for the shipment 
we determine which trucking company will haul the load and negotiate with them the fee we will pay  which represents freight brokerage purchased transportation expenses 
fuel fuel expense increased by million during and million during  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
during  and  our fuel expenses were million  million and million  respectively 
the following table summarizes and compares the relationship between fuel expense and freight linehaul revenue during each of the years in the three year period ended december  page of 
table of contents total linehaul and dedicated fleet revenue fuel expense fuel expense as a percent of total linehaul and dedicated fleet revenue most of the increases were related to the price of diesel fuel for our company operated fleet of tractors and trailers 
during  our average price per gallon fell by from levels  but in our average price per gallon of diesel fuel increased by about  as compared to during  the average price of diesel fuel increased by an additional over the level  for a cumulative two year increase of 
because fuel adjustment charges do not fully compensate us for our increased fuel costs  fuel price volatility impacts our profitability 
we have in place a number of strategies that mitigate  but do not eliminate  the impact of such volatility 
pursuant to the contracts and tariffs by which our freight rates are determined  those rates in most cases automatically fluctuate as diesel fuel prices rise and fall because of the fuel adjustment charges 
factors that prevent us from fully recovering fuel cost increases include the presence of deadhead empty miles  tractor engine idling and fuel to power our trailer refrigeration units 
such fuel consumption often cannot be attributable to a particular load and  therefore  there is no revenue to which a fuel adjustment may be applied 
also  our fuel adjustment charges are computed by reference to federal government indices that are released weekly for the price week 
when prices are rising  the price we incur in a given week is more than the price the government reports for the preceding week 
accordingly  we are unable to recover the excess of the current week s actual price to the preceding week s indexed price 
with regard to fuel expenses for company operated equipment  we attempt to further mitigate the impact of fluctuating fuel costs by operating more fuel efficient tractors and aggressively managing fuel purchasing 
also  owner operators are responsible for all costs associated with their equipment  including fuel 
therefore  the cost of such fuel is not a direct expense of ours  but to the extent such fuel adjustment charges are passed through by us to owner operators  fuel price volatility may impact purchased transportation expenses 
we use computer software to optimize our routing and fuel purchasing 
the software enables us to select the most efficient route for a trip 
it also assists us in deciding on a real time basis how much fuel to buy at a particular fueling station 
supplies and expenses supplies and expenses increased by million during and million during  each as compared to the immediately preceding year

table of contents fleet repairs and maintenance expenses increased by million and million  respectively  during and  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
the increases are primarily related to repairs and maintenance of our tractor fleet  the replacement cycle of which has been extended since at the beginning of  of our company operated tractor fleet was less than one year old 
by the end of  only of such tractors were less than one year old 
as assets such as tractors age  they become more costly to maintain 
although freight handling expenses are present in both our ltl and full truckload activities  such expenses are mostly ltl related 
the increased level of such costs and terminal and warehouse expense since is due to the increase in the number of ltl shipments we handled 
during  other supplies and expense increased by million as compared to the increase is principally attributable to selling general and administrative costs of our freight brokerage operation  the revenue from which increased by during as compared to rentals and depreciation the total of revenue equipment rent expense and depreciation expense increased by million during and million during  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
these fluctuations were due in part to changes in the use of leasing to finance our fleet 
equipment rental includes a component of interest related expense that is classified as non operating expense when we incur debt to acquire equipment 
equipment rent and depreciation also are affected by the replacement of less expensive  older model company operated tractors and trailers with more expensive new equipment 
in  our tractor replacement cycle was extended 
for more than ten years through  our primary tractor manufacturer contracted to repurchase our new trucks at the end of three years of service for an agreed price 
during  as the economy softened and demand for new and used trucking assets slackened  the manufacturer found itself with a surplus of used trucks which were difficult to re sell at prices near the amount the manufacturer had been paying us 
such sell back arrangements have been typical in the trucking industry for many years 
in we agreed to amend our sell back arrangement 
since then  our tractors have been sold back to the manufacturer under more restrictive terms 
also  the trade back cycle for most of our trucks in service on december  and for trucks delivered to us by this manufacturer after january  was extended by up to months 
when we agreed to extend our tractor replacement cycle  the price at which we will sell tractors back to the manufacturer was reduced by an amount that reflects the extension of the cycle 
for trucks that were delivered to us before january   there was no significant impact on our periodic equipment rental or depreciation expense resulting from the extended replacement cycle 
the lower pre agreed to prices for trucks delivered to us after january  resulted in slightly higher monthly rental or depreciation expense over the lives of the trucks 
in order to help us with the increased cost of maintaining tractors beyond our former month replacement cycle  the manufacturer agreed to extend the warranties on specified major components of the tractors 
the more restrictive terms on the trade back will require that we more closely align our tractor purchases with resales to the manufacturer 
we believe that we are not paying more for our new trucks than would be the case if we bought competitive equipment without such a trade back feature 
for many years  we have based our trailer depreciation on a seven year replacement cycle 
based on the results of a study we completed in the third quarter of  beginning in the last three months of  we increased our replacement cycle for owned non refrigerated trailers from seven to ten years 
owned refrigerated  leased refrigerated and leased non refrigerated trailers will remain on a seven year replacement cycle 
the change in our service lives of our non refrigerated trailers reduced our depreciation expense by about  from what would have otherwise been reported 
the impact on our income for was approximately  there was no impact on our diluted per share earnings for this change resulted in a increase in s diluted per share earnings

during  we engaged the services of independent actuaries to help us improve the process by which we estimate the amount of our claims reserves 
such estimates address the amount of the claims settlements as well as legal and other fees associated with attaining such settlements 
as a result of the actuarial studies during  we increased our reserves for such claims by approximately million 
about half of s increase in per mile insurance costs was due to this study 
during  and the first several months of  we retained the risk for liability claims up to million 
as of december   we retained the first million of our liability risk  our insurance company assumes the risk in full above our million deductible to million  the insurance company and we share the risk equally between million and million and we are fully insured above million to million 
we have accrued for our estimated costs related to our liability claims 
when an incident occurs we record a reserve for the incident s estimated outcome 
as additional information becomes available  adjustments are made 
accrued claims liabilities include all reserves for over the road accidents  work related injuries  self insured employee medical expenses and cargo losses 
employee related insurance costs are included in salaries  wages and related expenses in our statement of income 
the actuarial reports issued to us during provided us with factors we will continue to use to estimate expected costs associated with claims development and claims handling expenses 
it is probable that the estimates we have accrued for at any point in time will change in the future 
claims and insurance expenses can vary significantly from year to year 
the amount of open claims is significant 
there can be no assurance that these claims will be settled without a material adverse effect on our financial position or our results of operations 
other and miscellaneous expense gains on the disposition of equipment were between and million in each of the two years ended december  and such gains were million during the amount of such gains depends primarily upon conditions in the market for previously owned equipment and on the quantity of retired equipment sold 
we usually pre arrange the retirement sales value when we accept delivery of a new tractor 
before  the market for used trucking equipment was quite strong 
during and  the market value of previously owned trucking equipment fell dramatically 
the market value of these assets improved somewhat during and further in  but recovered substantially during fluctuations in the market value of our leased equipment do not impact the pre arranged retirement value of tractors presently in our fleet  but softness in the market for used equipment could diminish future pre arranged retirement values 
that may require us to increase the amount of depreciation and rental expense we incur in and beyond 
we do not expect used equipment market prices to alter our current depreciation or rental expense related to trailers  but changes in the trailer market values could impact the amount of gains on sale of trailers in future periods 
miscellaneous expenses were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
page of 
table of contents during  we incurred more than million in expenses and professional fees associated with our efforts to comply with the internal control provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of as of march  such initial compliance efforts were substantially complete 
accordingly  these costs are expected to diminish in the future 
higher legal and professional fees associated with matters other than the management of liability claims against us also contributed to the higher level of miscellaneous expense since  as did a write down of intangible assets during the professional fee increase was related to legal and auditing expenses for general corporate matters and our continuing efforts to comply with new corporate governance and financial reporting requirements 
the intangible assets we wrote down were related to trade names and other assets we previously acquired but have now effectively been abandoned

the purpose of these write downs was to reflect our assets at the lower of our cost or market value  as required by gaap 
further analysis of such market values was conducted after new management was put in place during the fourth quarter of the disappointing quantities of the inventory that we were able to sell during was a primary factor in our decision to dispose of a significant amount of the inventory and reduce our expectation as to the net realizable value of what remained 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in additional write downs of our non freight inventory 
we do not presently expect to record further write downs of our non freight inventories 
before  we sold the largest component of our non freight operations 
the business we sold is a dealership engaged in the sale and service of refrigeration equipment and of trailers used in freight transportation 
when the sale closed  we received a note receivable from the buyer for million and a limited partnership interest in the buyer group to which we assigned an initial value of million 
the note must be repaid in three equal installments beginning in december of in december of  the buyer paid us million in cash as a prepayment of the note

during  our benefit from income taxes was million 
in certain prior years  we recorded income tax deductions for interest paid on loans against insurance policies as allowed under united states federal tax laws 
due to the uncertainty of such deductions  we maintained a million reserve for the contingent expense that could have resulted from any related tax assessments

liquidity and capital resources debt and working capital cash from our freight revenue is typically collected between and days after the service has been provided 
we continually seek to accelerate our collection of accounts receivable to enhance our liquidity and reduce our debt 
our freight business is highly dependent on the use of fuel  labor  operating supplies and equipment provided by owner operators 
we are typically obligated to pay for these resources within seven to fifteen days after we use them  so our payment cycle is a significantly shorter interval than is our collection cycle 
this disparity between cash payments to our suppliers and cash receipts from our customers can create significant needs for borrowed funds to finance our working capital  especially during the busiest time of our fiscal year 
the associated increase in operating cash flow was used to reduce our debt by million during and to finance increased expenditures for revenue equipment purchased during as compared to during  we entered into a new credit agreement with two banks 
the credit agreement was amended during june and expires on june  debt may be secured by our revenue equipment  trade accounts receivable and inventories

table of contents as of december  our debt was million and letters of credit issued by us for insurance purposes and to equipment leasing companies were million 
as of december   we had contracts to purchase tractors and trailers totaling million during we expect to lease many of those assets when they are placed into service 
we lease equipment and real estate 
rentals are due under non cancelable operating leases for facilities  tractors and trailers 
our minimum lease payments and residual guarantees do not exceed of the leased asset s cost  the lease terms are for fewer years than of the leased asset s economic life  the leases do not convey ownership to us at the end of the term of the lease and the leases do not contain bargain purchase arrangements 
accordingly  the leases are accounted for as operating leases and rentals are recorded as rent expense over the term of the leases 
facility and trailer leases do not contain guaranteed residual values in favor of the lessors 
most of the tractors we leased prior to and many of the tractors we leased since are leased pursuant to agreements under which we have partially guaranteed the assets end of lease term residual value 
tractor leases entered into before typically have month terms  and tractor leases entered into after have either or month terms 
the portions of the residuals we have guaranteed vary from lessor to lessor 
gross residuals are between and of the leased asset s historical cost  of which we have guaranteed the first to of the historical cost 
the lessors remain at risk for between and of the remainder of such leased asset s historical cost 
because our lease payments and residual guarantees do not exceed of the tractor s cost  the leases are accounted for as operating leases and rentals are recorded as rent expense over the term of the leases 
offsetting our lease residual guarantees  when our tractors were originally leased  the tractor manufacturer conditionally agreed to repurchase the tractors at the end of the term of the lease 
factors which may limit our ability to recover the amount of the residual guaranty from the manufacturer include specifications as to the physical condition of each tractor  their mechanical performance  each vehicles accumulated mileage  and whether or not we order replacement and additional vehicles from the same manufacturer 
the price to be paid by the manufacturer is generally equal to the full amount of the lessor s residual 
in addition to residual values  our tractor leases contain fair value purchase options 
our agreement with the tractor manufacturer enables but does not require us to sell the tractors back to the manufacturer at a future date  should we own them at such time  at a predetermined price 
in order to avoid the administrative efforts necessary to return leased tractors to the lessor  we typically purchase such tractors from the lessor by paying the residual value and then sell the tractors to the manufacturer 
there is no gain or loss on these transactions because the residual value we pay to the lessor is generally equal to the manufacturer s purchase price 
at december   the amount of our obligations to lessors for residual guarantees did not exceed the amount we expect to recover from the manufacturer 
most of our million commitment to acquire equipment during relates to tractors 
we expect to lease most of these tractors when they are placed into service 
we also lease a significant portion of our company operated trailers 
because trailer leases generally do not involve guaranteed residuals  the lessor is fully at risk for the end of term value of the asset 
our lease commitments for and beyond include million for rentals of tractors owned by two of our officers 
because the terms of these leases with such related parties are more flexible than those governing tractors we lease from unaffiliated lessors  we pay the related parties a premium over the rentals we pay to unaffiliated lessors 
certain terms of our related party leases are generally more flexible to us than are leases with unrelated parties 
examples of the more favorable terms include requirements as to insurance  financial covenants and restrictions  the ability to reassign tractors among our various operating fleets and the ability to retire leased assets prior to the maturity of the lease term 
for the last three years  we have also rented from the same officers trailers on a month to month basis 
the annual rentals we paid pursuant to these related party trailer leases were approximately thousand during each of the years in the three year period ended december  per reference to similar rental agreements in effect between ourselves and unrelated party trailer rental companies  as of december   the annual fair rental value of these trailers was approximately thousand 
our audit committee has approved these transactions 
depending upon the availability of qualified drivers and the level of customer demand for our services  we may add between and tractors to our company operated fleet during in addition  approximately of our oldest company operated tractors are expected to be replaced during these expenditures will be financed with internally generated funds  borrowings under available credit agreements and leasing 
we expect these sources of capital to be sufficient to finance our operations
