new accounting pronouncements 
the information in md a should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements in item of this report 
the event that had the most significant earnings impact in  and the main reason for the significant earnings increase over  was the company s sale of its entire interest in ue  a district heating and electric generation business in the czech republic 
this sale resulted in a million gain  net of tax 
current market conditions  including the increasing value of the czech currency as compared to the us dollar  caused the value of the assets of ue to increase  providing an opportunity to sell the ue operations at a profit for the company 
as a result of the decision to sell its majority interest in ue  the company determined it appropriate to present the czech republic operations as discontinued operations beginning in june the company also determined it appropriate to discontinue all reporting for an international segment in june since the czech republic operations represented substantially all of the activity in that segment 
any remaining international activity has been included in corporate operations for all periods presented below 
critical accounting policies the company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies whereby judgments or uncertainties could affect the application of those policies and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to item at note a summary of significant accounting policies 
oil and gas exploration and development costs 
in the company s exploration and production segment  oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development costs are capitalized under the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting methodology  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized  including internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the internal costs that are capitalized do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities 
the company believes that determining the amount of the company s proved reserves is a critical accounting estimate 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of reserves that  based on geologic and engineering data  appear with reasonable certainty to be producible under existing economic and operating conditions 
such estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and may be subject to substantial revisions as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
the estimates involved in determining proved reserves are critical accounting estimates because they serve as the basis over which capitalized costs are depleted under the full cost method of accounting on a units of production basis 
unevaluated properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until they are evaluated 
once they are evaluated  costs associated with these properties are transferred to the pool of costs being depleted 

table of contents in addition to depletion under the units of production method  proved reserves are a major component in the sec full cost ceiling test 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed on a country by country basis and determines a limit  or ceiling  to the amount of property acquisition  exploration and development costs that can be capitalized 
the ceiling under this test represents a the present value of estimated future net revenues using a discount factor of  which is computed by applying current market prices of oil and gas as adjusted for hedging to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet  less estimated future expenditures  plus b the cost of unevaluated properties not being depleted  less c income taxes 
the estimates of future production and future expenditures are based on internal budgets that reflect planned production from current wells and expenditures necessary to sustain such future production 
the amount of the ceiling can fluctuate significantly from period to period because of additions or subtractions to proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
the ceiling is then compared to the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes 
if the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling at the end of any fiscal quarter  a non cash impairment must be recorded to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value 
this non cash impairment cannot be reversed at a later date if the ceiling increases 
it should also be noted that a non cash impairment to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value in any given period causes a reduction in future depletion expense 
the company recorded non cash impairments relating to its canadian properties in which amounted to million after tax and resulted from downward revisions to crude oil reserves related to the canadian properties sold as well as a decline in crude oil prices 
it is difficult to predict what factors could lead to future impairments under the sec s full cost ceiling test 
as discussed above  fluctuations or subtractions to proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices have an impact on the amount of the ceiling at any point in time 
regulation 
the company is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
the company  in its utility and pipeline and storage segments  has accounting policies which conform to sfas  and which are in accordance with the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows the company to defer expenses and income on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the ratesetting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then flowed through the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in rates 
management s assessment of the probability of recovery or pass through of regulatory assets and liabilities requires judgment and interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders 
if  for any reason  the company ceases to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of its operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be eliminated from the balance sheet and included in the income statement for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
such amounts would be classified as an extraordinary item 
for further discussion of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities  refer to item at note b regulatory matters 
accounting for derivative financial instruments 
the company  in its exploration and production segment  energy marketing segment  pipeline and storage segment and all other category  uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil 
these instruments are categorized as price swap agreements  no cost collars  options and futures contracts 
the company  in its pipeline and storage segment  uses an interest rate collar to limit interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate debt 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  the company accounts for these instruments as effective cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
as such  gains or losses associated with the derivative financial instruments are matched with gains or losses resulting from the underlying physical transaction that is being hedged 
to the extent that the derivative financial instruments would ever be deemed to be ineffective  mark to market gains or losses from the derivative financial instruments would be recognized in the income statement without regard to an 
table of contents underlying physical transaction 
as discussed below  the company was required to discontinue hedge accounting for a portion of its derivative financial instruments  resulting in a charge to earnings in the company uses both exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative financial instruments 
the fair value of the non exchange traded derivative financial instruments are based on valuations determined by the counterparties 
refer to the market risk sensitive instruments section in item  md a  for further discussion of the company s derivative financial instruments 
pension and other post retirement benefits 
the amounts reported in the company s financial statements related to its pension and other post retirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis  which uses many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts 
these assumptions include the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increase and  for other post retirement benefits  the expected annual rate of increase in per capita cost of covered medical and prescription benefits 
the discount rate used by the company is equal to the moody s aa long term corporate bond index  rounded to the nearest basis points 
the duration of the securities underlying that index reasonably matches the expected timing of anticipated future benefit payments 
the expected return on plan assets assumption used by the company reflects the anticipated long term rate of return on the plan s current and future assets 
the company utilizes historical investment data  projected capital market conditions  and the plan s target asset class and investment manager allocations to set the assumption regarding the expected return on plan assets 
changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience could have a material impact on the amount of pension and post retirement benefit costs and funding requirements experienced by the company 
however  the company expects to recover substantially all of its net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit costs attributable to employees in its utility and pipeline and storage segments in accordance with the applicable regulatory commission authorization 
for financial reporting purposes  the difference between the amounts of pension cost and post retirement benefit cost recoverable in rates and the amounts of such costs as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability  as appropriate  as discussed above under regulation 
for further discussion of the company s pension and other post retirement benefits  refer to other matters in this item and to item at note f retirement plan and other post retirement benefits 
results of operations earnings compared with the company s earnings were million in compared with earnings of million in as previously discussed  the company has presented its czech republic operations as discontinued operations 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change in presentation 
the company s earnings from continuing operations were million in compared with million in the company s earnings from discontinued operations were million in compared with million in earnings from continuing operations did not change significantly as higher earnings in the pipeline and storage segment were largely offset by lower earnings in the utility and exploration and production segments and a higher loss in the all other category 
the increase in earnings from discontinued operations resulted from the gain on the sale of ue in in the discussion that follows  note that all amounts used in the earnings discussions are after tax amounts 
earnings from continuing operations and discontinued operations were impacted by several events in and  including events a million gain on the sale of ue  which was completed in july this amount is included in earnings from discontinued operations  a million gain in the pipeline and storage segment associated with a ferc approved sale of base gas  
table of contents a million gain in the pipeline and storage segment associated with insurance proceeds received in prior years for which a contingency was resolved during  a million loss related to certain derivative financial instruments that no longer qualified as effective hedges  a million impairment in the value of the company s investment in esne recorded in the all other category  a limited liability company that owns an megawatt  combined cycle  natural gas fired power plant in the town of north east  pennsylvania  and a million impairment of a gas powered turbine in the all other category that the company had planned to use in the development of a co generation plant 
events a million reduction to deferred income tax expense in the international segment resulting from a change in the statutory income tax rate in the czech republic 
this amount is included in earnings from discontinued operations  settlement of a pension obligation which resulted in the recording of additional expense amounting to million  allocated among the segments as follows million to the utility segment million in the new york jurisdiction and million in the pennsylvania jurisdiction  million to the pipeline and storage segment million to supply corporation and million to empire state pipeline  million to the exploration and production segment  million to the energy marketing segment and million to the corporate and all other categories  an adjustment to the sale of the company s southeast saskatchewan oil and gas properties in the exploration and production segment which increased earnings by million  and an adjustment to the company s sale of its timber properties in the timber segment  which reduced earnings by million 
compared with the company s earnings were million in compared with earnings of million in the company s earnings from continuing operations were million in compared with million in the company s earnings from discontinued operations were million in compared with million in the company also reduced earnings by million in associated with the cumulative effect of changes in accounting 
the decrease in earnings from continuing operations is primarily the result of lower earnings in the timber and utility segments partially offset by higher earnings in the exploration and production  and pipeline and storage segments  as shown in the table below 
earnings were impacted by the events discussed above and several events in  including events the company s timber segment completed the sale of approximately  acres of its timber property  increasing earnings by million  the company s exploration and production segment completed the sale of its southeast saskatchewan oil and gas properties in canada  reducing earnings by million  the company s exploration and production segment recorded impairment charges related to its canadian oil and gas assets which reduced earnings by million  an impairment in the amount of million  representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill associated with the company s operations in the czech republic  and 
table of contents a reduction in the amount of million  representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for plugging and abandonment costs in the company s exploration and production segment 
for a more complete discussion of the cumulative effect of changes in accounting  refer to note a summary of significant accounting policies in item of this report 
additional discussion of earnings in each of the business segments can be found in the business segment information that follows 
earnings loss by segment year ended september thousands utility pipeline and storage exploration and production energy marketing timber total reportable segments all other corporate total earnings from continuing operations earnings from discontinued operations cumulative effect of changes in accounting total consolidated includes earnings from the former international segment s activity other than the activity from the czech republic operations included in earnings from discontinued operations 
includes million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill associated with the company s operations in the czech republic and million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for plugging and abandonment costs in the company s exploration and production segment 
utility revenues utility operating revenues year ended september thousands retail revenues residential commercial industrial off system sales transportation other 
table of contents utility throughput million cubic feet mmcf year ended september retail sales residential commercial industrial off system sales transportation degree days percent warmer colder than year ended september normal actual normal prior year buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   compared with operating revenues for the utility segment decreased million in compared with this resulted primarily from the absence of off system sales revenues of million  offset by an increase of million in retail revenues 
effective september   distribution corporation stopped making off system sales as a result of the ferc s order  standards of conduct for transmission providers  as discussed more fully in the rate matters section below 
however  due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales have been minimal and there was not a material impact to margins in the increase in retail revenues was primarily the result of the recovery of higher gas costs gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues  colder weather in the pennsylvania jurisdiction and the impact of base rate increases in both new york and pennsylvania 
the recovery of higher gas costs resulted from a much higher cost of purchased gas 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
lower retail sales volumes  due primarily to lower customer usage per account  partially offset the increase in retail revenues associated with the recovery of higher gas costs and the base rate increases 
also  retail industrial sales revenue declined due to fuel switching and production declines of certain large volume industrial customers as a result of a general economic downturn in the utility segment s service territory 
the increase in other operating revenues of million is largely related to amounts recorded pursuant to rate settlements with the nypsc 
in accordance with these settlements  distribution corporation was allowed to utilize certain refunds from upstream pipeline companies and certain other credits referred to as the cost mitigation reserve to offset certain specific expense items 
in  distribution corporation utilized million of the cost mitigation reserve  which increased other operating revenues  to recover previous undercollections of pension and post retirement expenses 
the impact of that increase in other operating revenues was offset by an equal amount of operation and maintenance expense thus there is no earnings impact 
this increase to other operating revenues was partially offset by two out of period regulatory adjustments recorded during the first adjustment related to the final settlement with the staff of the nypsc of the earnings sharing liability for the to time period 
as a result of that 
table of contents settlement  the new york rate jurisdiction recorded additional earnings sharing expense as an offset to other operating revenues of million 
the second adjustment related to a regulatory liability recorded for previous over collections of new york state gross receipts tax 
in preparing for the implementation of the recent settlement agreement in new york  the company determined that it needed to adjust that regulatory liability by million of which million was recorded as a reduction of other operating revenues and million was recorded as additional interest expense related to fiscal years and prior 
compared with operating revenues for the utility segment decreased million in compared with this resulted largely from a decrease in transportation revenues of million and a decrease in other revenues of million 
transportation revenues decreased because of lower volumes being transported as a result of fuel switching  a general economic downturn in the utility segment s service territory and warmer weather  as shown in the degree day table above 
retail revenues did not change significantly from the prior year as the impact to revenues of lower retail sales volumes was largely offset by the recovery of higher gas costs gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues and a base rate increase in the utility segment s pennsylvania jurisdiction 
the recovery of higher gas costs resulted from a much higher cost of purchased gas 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
warmer weather and lower customer usage per account were the major factors in the decrease in retail sales volumes 
the decrease in retail industrial sales volumes can be attributed to fuel switching and a general economic downturn in the utility segment s service territory 
the decrease in other operating revenues is largely related to the three year rate settlement approved by the nypsc which ended on september  as part of the three year rate settlement  distribution corporation was allowed to utilize certain refunds from upstream pipeline companies and certain other credits referred to as the cost mitigation reserve to offset certain specific expense items 
in  distribution corporation utilized million of the cost mitigation reserve by recording million of other operating revenues 
while the three year rate settlement was extended for an additional year  the provisions of the settlement which gave rise to the other operating revenues in did not continue in  causing other operating revenues to decrease by million in the impact of utilizing a portion of the cost mitigation reserve in revenues in was offset by an equal amount of operation and maintenance expense and interest expense thus there is no earnings impact 
partially offsetting this decrease in revenues  in accordance with the three year rate settlement which ended on september   distribution corporation recorded a refund provision of million as a reduction of other operating revenues 
while the provisions of the settlement were extended for a one year period  as previously discussed  this refund provision did not recur in because the new york rate jurisdiction s earnings did not exceed the sharing threshold 
the refund provision relates to a sharing with customers of earnings over a predetermined amount 
earnings compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the major factors driving this decrease were lower weather normalized usage per customer account in both the new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions million and an increase in bad debt expenses of million 
the increase in bad debt expenses is attributable to the increase in the reserve for doubtful accounts to reflect the increase in final billed balances  as well as the increased age of outstanding receivables heading into the heating season 
these negative factors were partially offset by the impact of base rate increases in both new york and pennsylvania million and the recording of accrued interest on a pension related asset in accordance with the new york rate case settlement agreement million  as well as the impact of colder than normal weather in pennsylvania million 
the earnings impact of the two out of period regulatory adjustments discussed above was largely offset by lower interest expense on borrowings due to lower debt balances 

table of contents the impact of weather on the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a wnc 
the wnc  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction 
in addition  in periods of colder than normal weather  the wnc benefits the utility segment s new york customers 
in  the wnc did not have a significant impact on earnings 
for  the wnc preserved earnings of approximately million because it was warmer than normal in the new york service territory 
compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the major factors driving this decrease were an increase in pension and other post retirement expenses of million  higher bad debt expenses of million  warmer weather in the pennsylvania jurisdiction million  and lower usage per customer account in the new york jurisdiction million 
these negative factors were partially offset by the absence of a refund provision in the new york jurisdiction in related to an earnings sharing mechanism in the new york jurisdiction million  as discussed above 
other offsetting factors included a base rate increase in the pennsylvania jurisdiction of million and lower interest expense of million 
the increase in pension and other post retirement expenses referred to above can be attributed largely to three factors 
first  in accordance with a one year settlement extension commencing on october  in the new york rate jurisdiction referred to above  the company was required to record an additional million before tax million after tax of pension and other post retirement expense for the year ended september  without a corresponding increase in revenues 
second  the utility segment recorded million of expense associated with the settlement of a pension obligation 
third  pension and other post retirement expenses in the pennsylvania rate jurisdiction increased by million as the rate settlement in that jurisdiction reflected higher pension funding amounts and the amortization of previous other post retirement deferrals 
in  the wnc preserved million of earnings since the weather was warmer than normal in the new york service territory 
for  the wnc reduced earnings by approximately million because it was colder than normal in the new york service territory 
purchased gas the cost of purchased gas is the company s single largest operating expense 
annual variations in purchased gas costs are attributed directly to changes in gas sales volumes  the price of gas purchased and the operation of purchased gas adjustment clauses 
currently  distribution corporation has contracted for long term firm transportation capacity with supply corporation and six other upstream pipeline companies  for long term gas supplies with a combination of producers and marketers  and for storage service with supply corporation and three nonaffiliated companies 
in addition  distribution corporation satisfies a portion of its gas requirements through spot market purchases 
changes in wellhead prices have a direct impact on the cost of purchased gas 
distribution corporation s average cost of purchased gas  including the cost of transportation and storage  was per mcf in  an increase of from the average cost of per mcf in the average cost of purchased gas in was higher than the average cost of per mcf in additional discussion of the utility segment s gas purchases appears under the heading sources and availability of raw materials in item 
table of contents pipeline and storage revenues pipeline and storage operating revenues year ended september thousands firm transportation interruptible transportation firm storage service interruptible storage service other pipeline and storage throughput mmcf year ended september firm transportation interruptible transportation compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment increased million in as compared with this increase is primarily attributable to higher revenues from unbundled pipeline sales of million included in other revenues in the table above  due to higher natural gas prices 
higher cashout revenues of million  reported as part of other revenues in the table above  also contributed to the increase 
cashout revenues are completely offset by purchased gas expense 
in addition  interruptible transportation revenues increased by million  primarily due to an increase in supply corporation s gathering revenues  and firm storage revenues increased million  primarily due to higher rate agreements contracted with supply corporation customers 
offsetting these increases  the decrease in firm transportation revenues of million reflects the cancellation of contracts with supply corporation by certain large usage non affiliated customers million and the utility segment s cancellation of a portion of its firm transportation with supply corporation in april million 
in addition  firm transportation revenues decreased by million because supply corporation no longer charges customers a surcharge for its membership to the gas research institute gri 
the decrease in revenues resulting from cancellation of the gri surcharge was completely offset by lower operation expense 
while supply corporation s transportation volumes increased during the year  volume fluctuations generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
offsetting the decreases in supply corporation s firm transportation revenues was a million increase in empire s firm transportation revenues  primarily due to an increase in transportation volumes 
compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment increased million in as compared with the acquisition of empire from duke energy corporation on february  was a significant factor contributing to the revenue increase 
for  empire recorded operating revenues of million 
table of contents million in firm transportation revenues  million in interruptible transportation revenues and million in other revenues 
for the period of february  to september   empire recorded operating revenues of million million in firm transportation revenues  million in interruptible transportation revenues and million in other revenues 
another factor contributing to the increase in operating revenues in the pipeline and storage segment was a million increase in revenues from unbundled pipeline sales included in other revenues in the table above due to higher natural gas commodity prices and higher volumes 
these increases to operating revenues were partially offset by lower intercompany rental income of approximately million and lower cashout revenues of million  both of which are included in other revenues in the table above 
while transportation volumes increased during the year  volume fluctuations generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
earnings compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in contributing to the increase was a gain of million associated with the insurance proceeds received in prior years for which a contingency was resolved during the other main factors contributing to the increase were higher revenues from unbundled pipeline sales million  lower interest expense million  million of expense that did not recur in associated with the settlement of a pension obligation recognized in  as well as a million gain on the ferc approved sale of base gas in march  an increase in the reserve for preliminary project costs associated with the empire connector project million partially offset these increases 
the sale of ellisburg base gas  which amounted to mdth  will open up mdth of space for ongoing storage service 
at current market rates  it is expected that future storage service revenues including related transportation revenues may increase by approximately million per year with almost no increase in operating expenses associated with the higher revenues 
the additional storage has already been contracted for  effective april   resulting in approximately million of additional storage revenues and related transportation revenues in compared with compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in the increase can be attributed primarily to the earnings impact of the increase in revenues from unbundled pipeline sales of million  discussed above  as well as the increased earnings contribution from empire of million 
also  supply corporation interest expense decreased by million 
offsetting these increases  supply corporation recorded million of expense associated with the settlement of a pension obligation in supply corporation also experienced an earnings impact associated with higher operation and maintenance expense of million

gas production revenue after hedging increased million 
increases in the weighted average price of gas after hedging per mcf more than offset an overall decrease in gas production  mmcf 
most of the decrease in gas production occurred in the gulf coast a  mmcf decline 
the decreases in gulf coast oil and gas production are consistent with the expected decline rates in the region 
this decrease in gulf coast gas production was partially offset by a  mmcf increase in canadian gas production 
the increase in canadian gas production is attributable to the sukunka e well  in which the company has a working interest 
other revenues decreased million largely due to a million mark to market adjustment for losses on certain derivative financial instruments that no longer qualified as effective hedges due to the anticipated delays in oil and gas production volumes caused by hurricane rita 
these volumes were originally forecast to be produced in the first quarter of the anticipated delays in oil and gas production volumes has caused the company to lower its production forecast for  from a range of to bcfe to a range of to bcfe

refer to the tables above for production and price information 
compared with operating revenues for the exploration and production segment decreased million in as compared with oil production revenue after hedging decreased million due to a  mbbl decline in production offset partly by higher weighted average prices after hedging per barrel

gas production revenue 
table of contents after hedging increased million 
increases in the weighted average price of gas after hedging per mcf more than offset an overall decrease in gas production 
most of the decrease in gas production occurred in the gulf coast a mmcf decline  which is consistent with the expected decline rates in the region 
lower west coast production a mmcf decline  down mainly due to a decline in this segment s south lost hills wells  was more than offset by a mmcf increase in canadian gas production 
the increase in canadian gas production is attributable to additional drilling in east central alberta 
the decline in the south lost hills wells was attributable to the maturing of the wells 
refer to further discussion of derivative financial instruments in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows 
refer to the tables above for production and price information 
earnings compared with the exploration and production segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in in  the company recorded an adjustment to the sale of its southeast saskatchewan properties that increased earnings by million 
in  the company recorded a mark to market adjustment  as discussed above under revenues  that decreased earnings by million 
higher lease operating and depletion expenses also decreased earnings by million and million  respectively 
the increase in lease operating expenses resulted mainly from increased canadian production and higher steaming costs associated with heavy crude oil production in the west coast region 
depletion expense increased despite a drop in production mostly due to an increase in the per unit depletion rate  which was largely the result of the higher finding and development costs experienced by seneca in all of these factors  which collectively resulted in a million decrease in earnings  were partially offset by higher oil and gas revenues  which increased earnings by million 
also  earnings benefited from higher interest income million and lower interest expense million 
the fluctuations in interest income and interest expense reflect the fact that the exploration and production segment has been operating solely within its own cash flow from operations 
short term borrowings have been eliminated and excess cash has been invested  resulting in higher interest income 
this excess cash will be used to fund operations and future capital expenditures 
lower general and administrative expenses  largely due to lower legal costs  also increased earnings by million 
compared with the exploration and production segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with a loss of million million from continuing operations and million included in cumulative effect of changes in accounting in earnings were impacted by a few events 
in  the company sold its southeast saskatchewan properties  recording a loss of million 
in  the company recorded an adjustment to the sale of its southeast saskatchewan properties which increased earnings by million 
when the transaction closed in september  the initial proceeds received were subject to an adjustment based on actual working capital and the resolution of certain income tax matters 
those items were resolved with the buyer in and  as a result  the company received an additional million of sales proceeds 
the company recorded impairment charges of million in related to its canadian oil and gas properties 
also contributing to the increase was the fact that the loss in included a charge of million representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for plugging and abandonment costs 
these events sum up to million of the overall earnings increase of million 
the remaining increase can be attributed to decreases in depletion  lease operating  and interest expense of million  million  and million  respectively  which more than offset the earnings impact of a million decrease in oil and gas revenues  discussed above  and a million increase in income tax expense due to a higher effective tax rate 
the decrease in depletion and lease operating expenses primarily reflects the absence of the company s former southeast saskatchewan properties from results of operations in the decrease in interest expense was the result of lower debt balances 
the higher effective tax rate resulted from the elimination of cross border intercompany loans in september as a result of the sale of the southeast saskatchewan properties 

table of contents energy marketing revenues energy marketing operating revenues year ended september thousands natural gas after hedging other energy marketing volumes year ended september natural gas mmcf compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment increased million in as compared with the increase primarily reflects an increase in the price of natural gas 
volumes were down compared to the prior year due to the loss of certain lower margin wholesale customers 
compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment decreased million in as compared with this decrease primarily reflects lower gas sales revenue due to lower throughput  which was the result of warmer weather and the loss of several large volume  but low margin  customers to other marketers 
earnings compared with the energy marketing segment earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the decrease primarily reflects lower margins caused by a reduction in the benefit of storage gas and  to a lesser extent  lower throughput 
compared with the energy marketing segment earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in while margins on gas sales improved slightly  this increase was offset by expenses associated with the settlement of a pension obligation and a higher effective tax rate 

table of contents timber revenues timber operating revenues year ended september thousands log sales green lumber sales kiln dry lumber sales other timber board feet year ended september thousands log sales green lumber sales kiln dry lumber sales compared with operating revenues for the timber segment increased million in as compared with this increase can be partially attributed to an increase in kiln dry lumber sales of million largely due to an increase in cherry lumber sales volumes of million board feet 
while there was a decline in kiln dry lumber sales volumes from other species million board feet  the revenue from those species is not significant 
cherry kiln dry lumber revenues represent over of the timber segment s total kiln dry lumber revenues 
the increase in volume is a result of the addition of two new kilns in february  allowing for an increase in the amount of kiln dry lumber that can be processed 
in addition  green lumber sales also increased by million due to increased sales of maple green lumber primarily as a result of favorable weather conditions that allowed for an increase in harvesting 
compared with operating revenues for the timber segment did not change significantly in as compared with the decrease in log sales of million was principally due to the company s august sale of approximately  acres of timber properties discussed below 
however  kiln dry lumber sales increased million due to an increase in activity at the company s mill operations 
as a result of the sale of the timber properties  a larger percentage of timber processed in the company s mills is now purchased from third parties 
earnings compared with the timber segment earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in increases in the cost of goods sold during due to a greater amount of timber being harvested on purchased stumpage  which has a higher cost basis than other raw material sources  is primarily responsible for the earnings decline 
also contributing to the decline were overall increases in operating expenses due to higher utility costs 
partially offsetting these declines in earnings were 
table of contents the increased sales of kiln dry lumber and green lumber discussed above  as well as the favorable earnings impact associated with the non recurrence of a million loss recorded in related to the company s fiscal sale of timber properties  as discussed below 
compared with the timber segment earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in this earnings fluctuation is largely a reflection of the sale of approximately  acres of timber properties on august  for approximately million 
as a result of the sale  the company recorded a gain of million in in  the company received final timber cruise information of the properties it sold and  based on that information  determined that property records pertaining to million of timber property were not properly shown as having been transferred to the purchaser 
as a result  the company removed those assets from its property records and adjusted the previously recognized gain downward by recognizing a loss of million 
the combination of these two events caused earnings to be lower by million 
the remainder of the decrease is attributable to lower sales of cherry logs in while kiln dry lumber sales increased  this benefit was largely offset by an increase in costs associated with purchased timber 
all other and corporate operations all other and corporate operations primarily includes the operations of horizon lfg  horizon power  former international segment activity other than the activity from the czech republic operations  and corporate operations 
horizon lfg owns and operates short distance landfill gas pipeline companies 
horizon power s activity primarily consists of equity method investments in seneca energy  model city and esne 
horizon power has a ownership interest in each of these entities 
the income from these equity method investments is reported as operations of unconsolidated subsidiaries on the consolidated statement of income 
seneca energy and model city generate and sell electricity using methane gas obtained from landfills owned by outside parties 
esne generates electricity from an megawatt  combined cycle  natural gas fired power plant in north east  pennsylvania 
horizon power also owns a gas powered turbine and other assets which it had planned to use in the development of a co generation plant 
the company is in the process of selling these assets 
the former international segment activity primarily consists of project development activities  the largest being projects in italy and bulgaria 
earnings compared with all other and corporate operations experienced a loss of million in  which was million greater than a loss of million in during  horizon power recorded a million impairment in the value of its investment in esne 
management believes that there is a decline in the market value of esne that is other than temporary in nature given continuing high commodity prices for natural gas and the negative impact these prices have had on operations 
esne has experienced losses over the last few years 
it also recorded a million impairment of the gas powered turbine mentioned above 
this impairment was based on a review of current market prices for similar turbines 
however  these impairments were partially offset by higher equity method income from horizon power s investments in seneca energy and model city million 
horizon lfg s earnings decreased by million due to lower margins on gas sales 
the overall decreases experienced by horizon power and horizon lfg were partially offset by a million improvement in the losses experienced by the former international segment  largely due to lower project development costs  and a million improvement in earnings of corporate operations 
compared with all other and corporate operations experienced a loss of million in  an improvement of million over a loss of million in this improvement can be attributed primarily to a 
table of contents million increase in the earnings of horizon lfg and a million improvement in the losses experienced by the former international segment 
interest income interest income was million higher in compared to as discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  the main reason for this increase was the accrual of million in interest on a pension related asset in accordance with the new york rate case settlement agreement that was completed in interest income for did not change significantly from interest income in other income other income was million higher in compared to as discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  the main reasons for this increase included a million gain in the pipeline and storage segment associated with a ferc approved sale of base gas in and a million gain in the pipeline and storage segment associated with insurance proceeds received in prior years for which a contingency was resolved during other income for did not change significantly from other income in interest charges although most of the variances in interest charges are discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  following is a summary on a consolidated basis interest on long term debt decreased million in and million in the decrease in both years was primarily the result of a lower average amount of long term debt outstanding 
other interest charges were million higher in compared to  however  other interest charges were million lower in compared to the increase in resulted mainly from million of interest expense recorded by the utility segment as part of an adjustment to a regulatory liability recorded for previous over collections of new york state gross receipts tax 
the decrease in was primarily the result of lower weighted average interest rates on short term debt combined with a lower average amount of short term debt outstanding

cash provided by operating activities in the utility and pipeline and storage segments may vary substantially from year to year because of the impact of rate cases 
in the utility segment  supplier refunds  over or under recovered purchased gas costs and weather also significantly impact cash flow 
the impact of weather on cash flow is tempered in the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction by its wnc and in the pipeline and storage segment by supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
cash provided by operating activities in the exploration and production segment may vary from period to period as a result of changes in the commodity prices of natural gas and crude oil 
the company uses various derivative financial instruments  including price swap agreements  no cost collars  options and futures contracts in an attempt to manage this energy commodity price risk 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  a decrease of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in much of this decrease can be attributed to higher hedging collateral deposits in the energy marketing and exploration and production segments 
the decrease is also attributable to gas cost recovery timing differences as well as increased working capital requirements in the utility segment 
partially offsetting this decrease  the corporate operation experienced a significant cash outflow in january due to a million lump sum payment to a 
table of contents participant of the company s nonqualified defined benefit plan under a provision of an agreement previously entered into between the company and the participant 
no such cash outflow occurred during investing cash flow expenditures for long lived assets the company s expenditures for long lived assets from continuing operations totaled million in the table below presents these expenditures year ended september  total expenditures for long lived assets millions utility pipeline and storage exploration and production timber all other and corporate total expenditures from continuing operations excludes expenditures from discontinued operations of million 
utility the majority of the utility capital expenditures were made for replacement of mains and main extensions  as well as for the replacement of service lines

the company completed a ferc approved sale of base gas from supply corporation s jointly owned ellisburg storage pool in march for million in sales proceeds 
as a result of the sale  property  plant  and equipment was reduced by million for the cost basis of the gas and a million gain before tax on the sale million after tax was recognized by the company in the proceeds of this sale are included in other investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows at september  the gain is included in other adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities 
exploration and production the exploration and production segment s capital expenditures were primarily well drilling and completion expenditures and included approximately million for the canadian region  million for the gulf coast region million for the off shore program in the gulf of mexico  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
these amounts included approximately million spent to develop proved undeveloped reserves 
timber the majority of the timber segment capital expenditures were made for the purchase of land and timber rights in elk county  pennsylvania in january the land and timber  consisting of approximately  acres  was purchased for approximately million 
the remaining million of capital expenditures in was made for purchases of equipment for highland s sawmill and kiln operations 

table of contents all other and corporate the majority of the all other and corporate capital expenditures were for capital improvements to the company s corporate headquarters and to the company s landfill gas pipeline operations

estimated capital expenditures for the utility segment in will be concentrated in the areas of main and service line improvements and replacements and  to a minor extent  the purchase of new equipment 
estimated capital expenditures for the pipeline and storage segment in will be concentrated in the reconditioning of storage wells  replacement of storage and transmission lines  and improvements of compressor stations 
the estimated capital expenditures for also includes million for the empire connector project 
the company continues to explore various opportunities to expand its capabilities to transport gas to the east coast  either through the supply corporation or empire systems or in partnership with others 
in october  empire filed an application with the ferc for the authority to build and operate the empire connector project to expand its natural gas pipeline operations to serve new markets in new york and elsewhere in the northeast by extending the empire pipeline 
assuming the proposed millennium pipeline is constructed  the empire connector will provide an upstream supply link for phase i of the millennium pipeline and will transport canadian and other natural gas supplies to downstream customers  including keyspan gas east corporation  which has entered into precedent agreements to subscribe for at least mdth per day of natural gas transportation service through the empire state pipeline and the millennium pipeline systems 
the empire connector will be designed to move up to approximately mdth of natural gas per day 
empire anticipates that ferc will provide a determination on this application by november the forecasted expenditures for this project over the next three years are as follows million in  million in  and million in these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
the targeted in service date is november the company anticipates financing this project with cash on hand and or through the use of the company s bi lateral lines of credit 
as of september   the company had incurred approximately million in costs all of which have been reserved related to this project 
of this amount  million and million were incurred during the years ended september  and september   respectively 
the company also plans to extend supply corporation s pipeline system from the tuscarora storage field to the intersection of the proposed millennium and empire connector pipelines the tuscarora extension 
the tuscarora extension will be designed initially to move up to approximately mdth of natural gas per day 
the forecasted expenditures for this project over the next three years are as follows in  million in and million in these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
the targeted in service date is late in calendar or early 
table of contents in calendar the company anticipates financing this project with cash on hand and or through the use of the company s bi lateral lines of credit 
the tuscarora extension is contingent on market developments  and the company has not yet filed an application with the ferc for the authority to build and operate it 
estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment include approximately million for canada  million for the gulf coast region million on the off shore program in the gulf of mexico  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
estimated capital expenditures in the timber segment will be concentrated on the construction or purchase of new facilities and equipment for this segment s sawmill and kiln operations 
estimated capital expenditures in the all other and corporate category will be concentrated on the construction of a distributed generation facility at the company s corporate headquarters 
the company continuously evaluates capital expenditures and investments in corporations  partnerships and other business entities 
the amounts are subject to modification for opportunities such as the acquisition of attractive oil and gas properties  timber or natural gas storage facilities and the expansion of natural gas transmission line capacities 
while the majority of capital expenditures in the utility segment are necessitated by the continued need for replacement and upgrading of mains and service lines  the magnitude of future capital expenditures or other investments in the company s other business segments depends  to a large degree  upon market conditions 
financing cash flow the company did not have any outstanding short term notes payable to banks or commercial paper at september  however  the company continues to consider short term debt consisting of short term notes payable to banks and commercial paper an important source of cash for temporarily financing capital expenditures and investments in corporations and or partnerships  gas in storage inventory  unrecovered purchased gas costs  margin calls on derivative financial instruments  exploration and development expenditures and other working capital needs

if a downgrade in any of the company s credit ratings were to occur  access to the commercial paper markets might not be possible 
however  the company expects that it could borrow under its uncommitted bank lines of credit or rely upon other liquidity sources  including cash provided by operations 

table of contents under the company s existing indenture covenants  at september   the company would have been permitted to issue up to a maximum of million in additional long term unsecured indebtedness at then current market interest rates in addition to being able to issue new indebtedness to replace maturing debt 
the company s present liquidity position is believed to be adequate to satisfy known demands 
the company s indenture  pursuant to which million or of the company s long term debt as of september  was issued  contains a cross default provision whereby the failure by the company to perform certain obligations under other borrowing arrangements could trigger an obligation to repay the debt outstanding under the indenture 
in particular  a repayment obligation could be triggered if the company fails i to pay any scheduled principal or interest on any debt under any other indenture or agreement or ii to perform any other term in any other such indenture or agreement  and the effect of the failure causes  or would permit the holders of the debt to cause  the debt under such indenture or agreement to become due prior to its stated maturity  unless cured or waived

market risk sensitive instruments energy commodity price risk the company  in its exploration and production segment  energy marketing segment  pipeline and storage segment  and all other category  uses various derivative financial instruments derivatives  including price swap agreements  no cost collars  options and futures contracts  as part of the company s overall energy commodity price risk management strategy 
under this strategy  the company manages a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil  thereby attempting to provide more stability to operating results 
the company has operating procedures in place that are administered by experienced management to monitor compliance with the company s risk management policies 
the derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
the fair value of these derivatives  as shown below  represents the amount that the company would receive from or pay to the respective counterparties at september  to terminate the derivatives 
however  the tables below and the fair value that is disclosed do not consider the physical side of the natural gas and crude oil transactions that are related to the financial instruments 
the following tables disclose natural gas and crude oil price swap information by expected maturity dates for agreements in which the company receives a fixed price in exchange for paying a variable price as quoted in inside ferc or on the nymex

the company also had crude oil price swap agreements covering  bbls at a weighted average fixed rate of per bbl 
the decrease in natural gas price swap agreements from september to september is largely attributable to management s decision to utilize more no cost collars as a means of hedging natural gas production in the exploration and production segment 
the decrease in crude oil price swap agreements is primarily due to the fact that the company has not been entering into new swap agreements for its west coast crude oil production 
this decision is related to the price  or basis  differential that exists between the company s west coast heavy sour crude oil and the west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil that is quoted on the nymex 
the company has been unable to hedge against changes in the basis differential 
the following table discloses the notional quantities  the weighted average ceiling price and the weighted average floor price for the no cost collars used by the company to manage natural gas price risk 
the no cost collars provide for the company to receive monthly payments from or make payments to other parties when a variable price falls below an established floor price the company receives payment from the counterparty or exceeds an established ceiling price the company pays the counterparty

the company also had crude oil no cost collars covering  bbls at a weighted average floor price of per bbl and a weighted average ceiling price of per bbl 
the increase in natural gas no cost collars from september to september is a result of management s decision to utilize more no cost collars as a means of hedging natural gas production in the exploration and production segment 
no cost collars provide an attractive floor price for the company s natural gas production while allowing the company to retain a portion of the upside potential of higher prices

the company may be exposed to credit risk on some of the derivatives disclosed above 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss that the company would incur as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations 
to mitigate such credit risk  management performs a credit check and then  on an ongoing basis  monitors counterparty credit exposure 
management has obtained guarantees from the parent companies of the respective counterparties to its derivatives

at september   no 
table of contents individual counterparty represented greater than of total credit risk measured as volumes hedged by an individual counterparty as a percentage of the company s total volumes hedged 
exchange rate risk the exploration and production segment s investment in canada is valued in canadian dollars  and  as such  this investment is subject to currency exchange risk when the canadian dollars are translated into us dollars 
this exchange rate risk to the company s investment in canada results in increases or decreases to the cta  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets 
when the foreign currency increases in value in relation to the us dollar  there is a positive adjustment to cta 
when the foreign currency decreases in value in relation to the us dollar  there is a negative adjustment to cta 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from the million of variable rate debt included in other notes in the table below 
to mitigate this risk  the company uses an interest rate collar to limit interest rate fluctuations 
under the interest rate collar the company makes quarterly payments to or receives payments from another party when a variable rate falls below an established floor rate the company pays the counterparty or exceeds an established ceiling rate the company receives payment from the counterparty

order also provides an exemption for local distribution companies that are affiliated with interstate pipelines such as distribution corporation  but the exemption is limited  with very minor exceptions  to local distribution corporations that do not make any off system sales 
distribution corporation stopped making such off system sales effective september   although it continues to make certain sales permitted by a prior ferc order  ferc has required supply corporation to provide arguments justifying the continued effectiveness of that order 
supply corporation and distribution corporation would like to continue operating as they do  whether by waiver  amendment or further clarification of the new rules  or by complying with the requirements applicable if distribution corporation were an energy affiliate 
treating distribution corporation as an energy affiliate  without any waivers  would require changes in the way supply corporation and distribution corporation operate which would decrease efficiency  but probably would not increase capital or operating expenses to an extent that would be material to the financial condition of the company 
until there is further clarification from the ferc on the scope of these exemptions and rulings on the company s waiver requests  the company is unable to predict the impact order will have on the company 
as previously mentioned  distribution corporation stopped making off system sales  effective september  the company does not expect that change to have a material effect on the company s results of operations  as margins resulting from off system sales are minimal as a result of profit sharing with retail customers
