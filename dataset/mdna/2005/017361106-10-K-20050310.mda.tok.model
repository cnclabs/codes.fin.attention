table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview allegheny is an integrated energy business that owns and operates electric generation facilities and delivers electric and natural gas services to customers in pennsylvania  west virginia  maryland  virginia and ohio 
ae  allegheny s parent holding company  was incorporated in maryland in and is registered as a holding company under puhca 
allegheny operates its business primarily through ae s various directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries 
allegheny has two business segments the delivery and services segment includes allegheny s electric and natural gas t d operations 
the generation and marketing segment includes allegheny s power generation operations 
the delivery and services segment the principal companies and operations in ae s delivery and services segment include the following the distribution companies include monongahela excluding its west virginia generation assets  potomac edison and west penn 
each of the distribution companies is a public utility company and does business under the trade name allegheny power 
the distribution companies principal businesses are the operation of electric and natural gas public utility systems 
monongahela conducts an electric t d business in northern west virginia and an adjacent portion of ohio 
monongahela also conducts a natural gas t d business  primarily through mountaineer 
in august  monongahela signed a definitive agreement to sell its natural gas operations in west virginia  subject to certain conditions 
the sale is expected to be completed in mid to late monongahela also has generation assets  which are included in the generation and marketing segment 
see the generation and marketing segment below 
potomac edison operates an electric t d system in portions of maryland  virginia and west virginia 
west penn operates an electric t d system in southwestern  north and south central pennsylvania 
in april  the distribution companies transferred operational control over their transmission systems to pjm 
see the pjm market and the distribution companies plr obligations below 
allegheny ventures is a nonutility  unregulated subsidiary of ae that engages in telecommunications and unregulated energy related projects 
allegheny ventures has two principal wholly owned subsidiaries  acc and ae solutions 
acc develops fiber optic projects  including fiber and data services 
ae solutions manages energy related projects 
the generation and marketing segment the principal companies and operations in ae s generation and marketing segment include the following ae supply owns  operates and manages electric generation facilities 
ae supply also purchases and sells energy and energy related commodities  although it no longer engages in speculative trading activities 
monongahela s west virginia generation assets are included in the generation and marketing segment 
agc was incorporated in virginia in agc is owned approximately by ae supply and approximately by monongahela 
all of agc s revenues are derived from sales of its mw share of generation capacity from the bath county generation station to ae supply and monongahela 

table of contents ae supply is obligated under long term contracts to provide the distribution companies with the power that they need to meet a majority of their plr obligations 
the generation and marketing segment sells power into pjm and purchases power from pjm to meet its obligations to the distribution companies under these contracts 
see the pjm market and the distribution companies plr obligations below 
although most of the generation and marketing segment s generation capacity participates in the pjm system  it owns generation capacity outside of pjm  including agc s interest in the bath county generation station and generation facilities in gleason  tennessee and wheatland  indiana 
the gleason and wheatland generation facilities have been classified as held for sale  and their results have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the generation and marketing segment also purchases and sells power in wholesale markets 
however  ae supply exited its speculative trading activities in the western us trading markets and elsewhere in and has implemented a strategy to focus on asset based optimization and hedging within its geographic region 
for more information regarding the ae segments and subsidiaries discussed above  see business overview 
intersegment services aesc was incorporated in maryland in as a service company for ae 
ae  ae supply  agc  the distribution companies  allegheny ventures and their respective subsidiaries have no employees 
these companies reimburse aesc at cost for services provided to them by aesc s employees 
aesc had approximately  employees as of december  the pjm market and the distribution companies plr obligations allegheny s business has been significantly influenced by state and federal deregulation initiatives  including the implementation of retail choice and plans to transition from cost based to market based rates  as well as by the development of wholesale electricity markets and rtos  such as pjm 
each of the states in allegheny s service territory  other than west virginia  has  to some extent  deregulated its electric power industry 
pennsylvania  maryland  virginia and ohio have instituted retail customer choice and are transitioning to market based  rather than cost based  pricing 
in west virginia  the rates charged to retail customers are regulated by the west virginia psc and are determined through traditional  cost based  regulated utility rate making 
see business regulatory framework affecting allegheny state legislation  rate matters and regulatory developments 
the distribution companies have plr obligations to their customers in pennsylvania  maryland  virginia and ohio 
as providers of last resort  the distribution companies must supply power to retail customers who have not chosen alternative providers or have chosen to return to allegheny service at rates that are capped at various levels during the applicable transition period 
while these capped rates were determined based on the cost of producing power  they are generally lower than recent prevailing market prices for power 
in april  the distribution companies transferred functional control of their transmission assets to pjm 
pjm is the largest wholesale electricity market in the world and acts as an rto  coordinating the movement of electricity over the transmission grid in all or portions of delaware  illinois  maryland  new jersey  pennsylvania  west virginia  ohio  virginia and the district of columbia 
the distribution companies have adopted pjm s transmission pricing methodology  including pjm s congestion management system 
the distribution companies have long term contracts with ae supply under which ae supply provides the distribution companies with a majority of the power necessary to meet their plr retail obligations 
these 
table of contents contracts have both fixed price and market based pricing components 
the amount of power purchased under these contracts subject to the market based pricing component increases each year through the applicable transition period 
not all of these costs can be passed on to customers 
allegheny has a generation fleet that is anchored by base load coal fired units 
most of allegheny s generation assets participate in the pjm system 
the generation and marketing segment sells the power that it generates into pjm and purchases through pjm the power necessary to meet its obligations to the distribution companies 
historically  the distribution companies plr obligations have absorbed the majority of allegheny s generation capacity 
the generation and marketing segment sells power into pjm at prices determined through a competitive bidding process 
the prices that it receives in the pjm market vary depending upon demand and other market conditions 
prices generally are higher at times of peak demand and lower during off peak periods 
pjm directs  or dispatches  individual generation stations within its system to produce power 
depending on market conditions  line congestion  plant availability and other factors across the pjm system  an individual generation station within pjm may be available but may not be dispatched  if power is available from another station at a lower cost 
thus  at any given time  the generation and marketing segment s generation facilities may or may not be dispatched  without regard to the plr or other obligations of the distribution companies 
challenges and response prior to  allegheny functioned as an integrated regulated utility within its service area 
in response to federal and state deregulation initiatives  however  allegheny separated its energy generation business from its t d business by transferring the majority of its generation assets to ae supply 
allegheny s former senior management sought to transform ae supply into a national power merchant in order to capitalize on these regulatory and other energy industry trends 
as part of this strategy  ae supply acquired generation assets  which collectively expanded allegheny s owned or controlled generation capacity by nearly one third 
ae supply also began construction of new generation facilities 
in addition  ae supply purchased the energy trading division of merrill lynch in with this acquisition  the focus of ae supply s energy trading shifted from asset backed  short term trading in and around its generation assets to more speculative trading activities 
this expansion was financed primarily through debt 
beginning in  difficult market conditions  changes in the regulatory environment and allegheny s worsening credit profile placed allegheny in a weakened financial position  which continued during and into beginning in  allegheny s new senior management implemented recovery plans and new long term strategies 
allegheny s long term strategy is to focus on its core generation and t d businesses 
allegheny s management believes that this emphasis will enable allegheny to take advantage of its regional presence  operational expertise and market knowledge 
specific goals for enhancing long term value include restoring financial strength 
beginning in  allegheny significantly improved its liquidity and overall financial strength 
allegheny s management believes that it can continue this trend by focusing on the core business 
allegheny has reoriented its business to focus on its core businesses and assets 
in  allegheny exited its speculative trading activities in the western u 
s 
and other energy markets 
in addition  allegheny has sold  or is seeking to sell  non core assets 
substantially reducing and proactively managing debt 
between december  and january   allegheny repaid approximately billion of debt 
allegheny s goal is to reduce its debt by an additional million by the end of allegheny intends to continue its debt reduction efforts by applying some of its cash flow from operations and the proceeds from asset sales to the repayment of debt 
the extent to which allegheny utilizes these alternatives will depend upon the terms that are available to it and their impact on its financial condition  long term value and overall strategy 

table of contents improving liquidity 
allegheny is improving its liquidity through prudent cash management  opportunistic sales of non core assets  cutting costs and expenses  extending debt maturities and obtaining a revolving credit facility 
for example  in december  ae supply completed the sale of its lincoln generating facility and an accompanying tolling agreement for million in cash  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
also in december  ae sold a portion of its interest in ovec for million in cash  million of which was received at the closing of the transaction and the remaining million of which is expected to be paid after march   upon the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the proceeds from these transactions were used to repay debt 
ae and ae supply also completed refinancings in that extended the maturities and lowered the interest rates of much of their debt and established a revolving credit facility for ae 
see financial condition  requirements and resources liquidity and capital requirements 
maximizing operational efficiency 
allegheny is working to maximize the availability and operational efficiency of its physical assets  particularly its supercritical generation plants 
in addition  allegheny is seeking to optimize operations and maintenance costs for its generation facilities and t d assets and related corporate functions  to reduce costs and to pursue other productivity improvements necessary to build a high performance organization 
maximizing generation value 
allegheny is working to maximize the value of the power that it generates by ensuring full recovery of its costs and a reasonable return through the traditional rate making process for its regulated utilities  as well as through the transition to market based rates for ae supply and its subsidiaries 
managing environmental compliance and risks 
allegheny is working to effectively manage its environmental compliance efforts to ensure continuing compliance with applicable federal and state regulations while controlling its compliance costs  reducing emissions levels and minimizing its risk exposure 
rebuilding the management team 
allegheny rebuilt its management team in and key indicators and performance factors the delivery and services segment allegheny monitors the financial and operating performance of its delivery and services segment using a number of indicators and performance statistics  including the following revenue per mwh sold 
this measure is calculated by dividing total revenues from retail sales of electricity by total mwhs sold to retail customers 
revenue per mwh sold in  and was as follows revenue per mwh sold operations and maintenance costs o m 
management closely monitors and manages o m in absolute terms  as well as in relation to total revenues 
capital expenditures 
management manages and prioritizes capital expenditures to meet operational needs and regulatory requirements within available cash flow constraints 
heating degree days hdd and cooling degree days cdd 
hdd is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below degrees fahrenheit  which is considered normal 
cdd is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above degrees fahrenheit 
the regulated utility operations of the distribution 
table of contents companies are weather sensitive 
weather conditions directly influence the customer demand for electricity or natural gas delivered by the regulated utility 
in addition  regulated utility rates are determined  in part  on the basis of expected normal weather conditions 
accordingly  deviations in weather from normal levels can affect allegheny s financial performance 
normal historical hdd are  and normal historical cdd are  calculated on a weighted average basis across the geographic areas served by the distribution companies 
the following table shows actual hdd and cdd for the years indicated hdd cdd the generation and marketing segment allegheny monitors the financial and operating performance of its generation and marketing segment using a number of indicators and performance statistics  including the following kwh generated 
this is a measure of the total physical quantity of electricity generation and is monitored at the individual unit level  as well as various unit groupings 
equivalent availability factor eaf 
the eaf is a measure of a generation unit s availability to generate electricity 
a unit s availability is commonly less than  primarily as a result of unplanned outages or scheduled outages for planned maintenance 
allegheny monitors eaf by individual unit  as well as by various unit groupings 
one such grouping is all supercritical units 
a supercritical unit utilizes steam pressure in excess of  psi 
this design characteristic enables these units to be larger and more efficient than other generation units 
fort martin  harrison  hatfield s ferry and pleasants are supercritical units 
these units generally operate at high capacity for extended periods of time 
station operations and maintenance costs station o m 
station o m includes base maintenance  operations and special maintenance 
base maintenance and operations costs consist of normal recurring expenses related to the day to day on going operation of the generation station 
special maintenance includes outage  outage related or system projects that relate to all of the generation stations 
in addition  special maintenance includes cost of removal and loss from retirement of assets of the unregulated portion of the generation and marketing segment 
capital expenditures 
management manages and prioritizes capital expenditures to meet operational needs and regulatory requirements within available cash flow constraints

table of contents critical accounting estimates the following represent the critical accounting estimates for allegheny and its consolidated subsidiaries  where applicable 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires allegheny to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies during the period covered 
the estimates that require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments involve the fair value of commodity contracts and derivative instruments  goodwill  unbilled revenues  regulatory assets and liabilities  pension and other postretirement benefit costs  long lived assets and contingent liabilities 
significant changes in these estimates could have a material effect on allegheny s consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
commodity contracts allegheny has commodity contracts that are recorded at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized in earnings under sfas no

collectively referred to as sfas no 

fair values for exchange traded instruments  principally futures and certain options  are based on actively quoted market prices 
management estimates the fair value of commodity contracts that do not have quoted market prices  such as physical contracts  over the counter options and swaps  using available and estimated market data and pricing models 
these estimates may change from time to time 
inputs to the pricing models may include estimated forward natural gas and electricity prices  interest rates  estimates of market volatility for natural gas and electricity prices  the correlation of natural gas and electricity prices and other factors  such as generation unit availability and location  as appropriate 
these inputs require significant judgments and assumptions 
allegheny also adjusts the fair value of commodity contracts to reflect uncertainty in prices  operational risks related to generation facilities and risks related to the performance of counterparties 
these inputs and adjustments become more challenging  and the models become less precise  the further into the future these estimates are made 
actual effects on allegheny s consolidated financial position  cash flows and results of operations may vary significantly from expected results if the judgments and assumptions underlying the inputs to these models are wrong or the models prove to be unreliable 
during  allegheny exited its trading positions in the western us and other national energy markets 
in conjunction with its exit from these positions  allegheny recognized significant realized and unrealized losses during as of december   the majority of the fair value included in allegheny s trading portfolio was related to interest rate swap agreements and commodity cash flow hedges 
allegheny s accounting for commodity contracts is discussed in note  wholesale energy activities  to the consolidated financial statements 
also  see note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements and financial condition  requirements and resources derivative instruments and hedging activities below  for additional information regarding allegheny s accounting for derivative instruments under sfas no 
excess of cost over net assets acquired goodwill as of december   allegheny s intangible asset for acquired goodwill was million related to the acquisition of its energy marketing and trading business from merrill lynch in march allegheny tests goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in  allegheny recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to its delivery and services segment 
the estimation of the fair value of allegheny s reporting units an operating segment or one level below an operating segment involves the use of present value measurements and cash flow models 
this process 
table of contents involves judgments on a broad range of information  including  but not limited to  market pricing assumptions for future electricity revenues  future generation output and projected operating expenses and capital expenditures 
significant changes in the fair value estimates could have a material effect on allegheny s results of operations and financial position 
unbilled revenues unbilled revenues are primarily associated with the distribution companies 
energy sales to individual customers are based on their meter readings  which are performed on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  the amount of energy delivered to each customer after the last meter reading is estimated  and the distribution companies recognize unbilled revenues related to these amounts 
the unbilled revenue estimates are based on daily generation  purchases of electricity and natural gas  estimated customer usage by customer type  weather effects  electric and natural gas line losses and the most recent consumer rates 
a significant change in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on allegheny s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
regulatory assets and liabilities the distribution companies charge cost based rates that are regulated by various federal and state regulatory agencies 
as a result  the distribution companies qualify for the application of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
 which recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability 
regulatory assets or liabilities arise as a result of a difference between gaap  excluding the effects of rate regulation  and the economic effect of decisions by regulatory agencies 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred  because they are likely to be recovered through customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for various reasons 
the distribution companies recognize regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the rulings of their federal and state regulators 
future regulatory rulings may affect the carrying value and accounting treatment of allegheny s regulatory assets and liabilities at each balance sheet date 
allegheny assesses whether the regulatory assets are likely to be recovered in the future by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment  recent rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities continue to have an effect on the recovery of costs  the rate of return on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates 
a change in these assumptions may have a material effect on allegheny s results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions allegheny accounts for pensions under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
and other postretirement benefits under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  sfas no 

under these rules  certain assumptions are made that represent significant estimates 
there are many factors and significant assumptions involved in determining allegheny s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations opeb and costs each period  such as employee demographics including  among others  age  life expectancies and compensation levels  discount rates  expected rates of return on plan assets  estimated rates of future compensation increases  medical inflation and the fair value of assets funded for the plan 
see note  pension benefits and postretirement benefits other than pensions  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning these assumptions 
changes made to provisions for pension or other postretirement benefit plans may also affect current and future pension and opeb costs 
allegheny s assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed annually with an outside actuarial firm 
in determining its net periodic cost for pension benefits and for opeb for  allegheny utilized a discount rate and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
the discount rate for was  and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for was 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to develop the net periodic benefit costs for are and  respectively 
see note  pension benefits and postretirement benefits other than pensions  to the consolidated financial statements for additional assumptions used in determining net periodic benefit costs for these benefit plans 

table of contents in determining its liability  also referred to as the benefit obligation  for opeb at september  the measurement date  allegheny utilized a discount rate and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
the discount rate was in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was in see note  pension benefits and postretirement benefits other than pensions  to the consolidated financial statements for additional assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations for these benefit plans 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  allegheny reviews various aa bond yields 
allegheny also performs a yield curve equivalent rate analysis to derive the discount rate that most accurately matches the observed yields in the market for various maturities of debt to the duration of our liabilities 
the expected rate of return on plan assets for is based on projected long term equity and bond returns and asset allocations 
the following table shows the effect that a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets for would have on allegheny s pension and other postretirement benefits obligations and costs in millions percentage point increase percentage point decrease change in the discount rate pension and opeb benefit obligation net periodic pension and opeb cost change in expected rate of return on plan assets net periodic pension and opeb cost long lived assets allegheny s consolidated balance sheets include significant long lived assets that are not subject to recovery under sfas no 
as a result  allegheny must generate future cash flows from these assets in a non regulated environment to ensure that the carrying values of these assets are not impaired 
some of these assets are the result of capital investments that have been made in recent years and have not yet reached a mature life cycle 
allegheny assesses the carrying amount and potential impairment of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors allegheny considers in determining if an impairment review is necessary include significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in allegheny s use of the assets or business strategy related to the assets and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when allegheny determines that an impairment review is necessary  it compares the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is larger  allegheny recognizes an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
in these cases  allegheny determines fair value by the use of quoted market prices  appraisals or valuation techniques  such as expected discounted future cash flows 
allegheny must make assumptions regarding these estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the asset 
significant changes to these assumptions could have a material effect on allegheny s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
contingent liabilities allegheny has established reserves for estimated loss contingencies when management has determined that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known  or circumstances change  that affect the previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or the amount of loss 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon management s assumptions and estimates and advice of legal counsel or other third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the matter 
if the ultimate outcome were to differ from the assumptions and estimates  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be recognized 
contingent liabilities for allegheny include  but are not limited to  restructuring liabilities  legal  environmental and other commitments and contingencies

residential and commercial revenues increased due to higher mwh sales resulting from increases in customer usage and in the average number of customers served 
the increase in residential and commercial customer usage was primarily due to an increase in cooling degree days  partially offset by a decrease in heating degree days 
industrial revenues increased due to higher mwh sales resulting from increases in customer usage and in the average number of customers served 
retail electric revenues increased million for  primarily due to increased residential sales resulting from increases in the average number of customers served and in customer usage 
the increase in usage was primarily due to an increase in average heating degree days 
retail electric revenues include t d revenues from customers who chose alternate electricity generation suppliers 
approximately of allegheny s regulated customers in pennsylvania  maryland  virginia and ohio in and chose alternate electricity generation suppliers 
the return of customers to full service results in an increase in revenues due to the addition of a generation charge that allegheny had not collected while the customers were using an alternative electricity supplier 
the return of customers to plr service does not affect t d sales  because allegheny determines sales on the basis of kwh delivered to customers  regardless of their electricity supplier 
transmission services and bulk power revenues decreased million for  primarily due to a million decrease in wholesale revenues as a result of the expiration of certain wholesale contracts in and a million decrease in bulk power revenues as a result of outages 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in transmission revenues due to an increase in pjm transmission service revenue 
the delivery and services segment s transmission services and bulk power revenues decreased million for  primarily due to decreases in affiliated bulk power revenue and wholesale revenue 
on april   the distribution companies transferred functional control of their transmission assets to pjm 
as part of its approval of the transfer of control  ferc permitted a transmission rate surcharge designed to allow the distribution companies to recover million in revenues that would otherwise not be collectible once they joined pjm 
in  and  the distribution companies recovered approximately million  million and million of these surcharges  respectively 
these amounts are included in transmission services and bulk power revenues

approximately million of ae supply s contracts were classified as prices based on models  even though a portion of these contracts is valued based on observable market prices 
the most significant variables to the models that ae supply uses to value these contracts are the forward prices for both electricity and natural gas 
these forward prices are based on observable market prices to the extent prices are available in the market 
generally  electricity forward prices are actively quoted for about one year  and some observable market prices are available for about three years 
after three years  the forward prices for electricity are based on the forward price of natural gas and a marginal heat rate for generation based on more efficient natural gas fired generation to convert natural gas into electricity

the accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in earnings or other comprehensive income loss and requires that a company formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment 
the fair value of ae supply s trading portfolio is primarily comprised of interest rate swap agreements and commodity cash flow hedges  which represented a net liability of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these are accounted for at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets 
on march   ae supply entered into two treasury lock agreements to hedge its exposure to changing united states treasury interest rates on the forecasted issuance of long term  fixed rate debt in april these treasury lock agreements were accounted for as cash flow hedges

alliance energy services  on behalf of its customers  used both physical and financial derivative contracts  including forwards  nymex futures  options and swaps  in order to manage price risk associated with its purchase and sales activities 
these derivative contracts were accounted for as cash flow hedges 
alliance energy services primary strategy was to minimize its market risk exposure with respect to its forecasted physical natural gas sales contracts to its customers by entering into offsetting financial and physical

new accounting standards allegheny adopted fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  as of march  fin r requires allegheny to consolidate entities or contracts that represent a variable interest in a variable interest entity vie if allegheny is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 
under fin r  allegheny consolidated hunlock creek as of march  this entity operates two plants that produce and sell electricity to allegheny and a third party 
the consolidation resulted in an increase in total assets as of march  of million 
consolidation of this entity had no impact on allegheny s net income or stockholders equity 
allegheny determined that west penn and potomac edison each has a long term electricity purchase contract with an unrelated independent power producer ipp that represents a variable interest under fin r 
these would be consolidated if either west penn or potomac edison is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the applicable vie 
based on a qualitative analysis  allegheny does not believe that either west penn or potomac edison is the primary beneficiary of either of these vies 
allegheny continues to pursue  but has been unable to obtain  certain quantitative information from the ipps necessary to fully support this position 
west penn and potomac edison have estimated power purchases for from these two ipps in the amount of million and million  respectively 
west penn recovers a portion  and potomac edison recovers the full amount  of the cost of the applicable power contract in their rates charged to consumers 
neither west penn nor potomac edison is subject to any risk of loss associated with the applicable vie  because neither of them has any obligation to the applicable ipp other than to purchase the power that the vie produces according to the terms of the applicable electricity purchase contract

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk allegheny energy  inc 
during  allegheny continued its focus on reducing risk  optimizing the value of its generation facilities  reducing the volatility of mark to market earnings and prudently managing and protecting the value associated with the existing positions in its wholesale energy markets transactions portfolio 
allegheny remains exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
the commodity price risk exposure results from market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related commodities 
the interest rate risk exposure results from changes in interest rates related to interest rate swaps and variable and fixed rate debt 
allegheny has a program designed to systematically identify  measure  evaluate and actively manage and report market risks 
allegheny s corporate energy risk policy was adopted by its board of directors and is monitored by a risk management committee chaired by its chief executive officer and composed of senior management 
an independent risk management group within allegheny measures and monitors the risk exposures to ensure compliance with the policy and to ensure that the policy is periodically reviewed 
to manage the financial exposure to commodity price fluctuations in its wholesale transactions portfolio  fuel procurement  power marketing  natural gas supply and risk management activities  allegheny  through ae supply  enters into contracts  such as electricity and natural gas purchase and sale commitments  to hedge the risk exposure 
however  allegheny does not hedge the entire exposure of its operations from commodity price volatility for a variety of reasons 
to the extent allegheny does not hedge against commodity price volatility  its consolidated results of operations  cash flows and consolidated financial position may be affected either favorably or unfavorably by a shift in the forward price curves and spot commodity prices 
ae supply s wholesale energy business enters into certain contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity 
certain of these contracts are recorded at their fair value and are an economic hedge for the generation facilities 
for accounting purposes  the generation facilities are recorded at historical cost less depreciation 
as a result  allegheny s results of operations and financial position can be favorably or unfavorably affected by a change in forward market prices of its commodity driven risks  allegheny is primarily exposed to risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets  including the generation  fuel procurement  power marketing and the purchase and sale of electricity 
allegheny s wholesale activities principally consist of over the counter forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity and natural gas 
the majority of these contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell electricity at fixed prices in the future 
these forward contracts generally require physical delivery of electricity 
in  allegheny reduced its exposure to variable interest rates by repaying debt subject to variable interest rates 
the exposure was further reduced in january as a result of the repayment of debt with the proceeds of asset sales 
at december   ae s outstanding debt subject to variable interest rates was billion  compared to billion of outstanding debt subject to variable interest rates at december  ae and ae supply refinanced the borrowing facilities in march with the new loan facilities 
the new loan facilities carry the same interest rate risks as the borrowing facilities 
in october  ae supply refinanced the ae supply loans with the refinanced ae supply loan 
the refinanced ae supply loan carries the same risks as the ae supply loans 
accordingly  a one percent increase in the variable interest rate under the new ae facility and the refinanced ae supply loan would increase allegheny s projected interest expense in by approximately million  on an annual basis  based on the amount of outstanding debt as of december  for additional information regarding these financing activities  see financial condition  requirements and resources liquidity and capital requirements 

table of contents credit risk credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty to a transaction will be unable to fulfill its contractual obligations 
allegheny evaluates the credit standing of a prospective counterparty based on the prospective counterparty s financial condition 
where deemed necessary allegheny may impose specified collateral requirements and use standardized agreements that facilitate netting of cash flows 
allegheny monitors the financial conditions of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis 
allegheny s independent risk management group oversees credit risk 
allegheny engages in various short term energy trading activities 
the counterparties to these transactions generally include electric and natural gas utilities  independent power producers  energy marketers and commercial and industrial customers 
in the event the counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  allegheny may incur a loss to close out a position 
allegheny has a concentration of customers in the electric and natural gas utility industries  most of whom are viewed as above investment grade credit quality 
this concentration of customers may affect allegheny s overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  because these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
ae supply exited the western us energy markets and terminated or sold the majority of its speculative energy trading positions in all other national energy markets 
accordingly  ae supply has refocused the composition of its trading portfolio 
as of december   the fair value of allegheny s trading portfolio is comprised primarily of interest rate swap agreements with a single counterparty and commodity cash flow hedges 
if the counterparty to these interest rate swap agreements does not perform  ae supply may be exposed to greater costs 
ae supply  however  does not anticipate nonperformance by this counterparty  which is a multinational financial institution 
additionally  ae supply is a counterparty to certain long term agreements for the transportation of natural gas 
see business fuel  power and resource supply 
market risk market risk arises from the potential for changes in the value of energy related to price and volatility in the market 
allegheny reduces these risks by using its owned and contractually controlled generation assets to back positions on physical transactions 
allegheny monitors market risk exposure and credit risk limits within the guidelines of its corporate energy risk policy 
allegheny evaluates commodity price risk  operational risk and credit risk in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts 
allegheny and ae supply use various methods to measure their exposure to market risk on a daily basis  including a value at risk model var 
var is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on historical market price and volatility data over a given period of time 
the quantification of market risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors to set the overall corporate risk tolerance  determine risk targets and monitor positions 
allegheny and ae supply calculate var by using a variance covariance approach  in which the option positions are evaluated by using their delta equivalences 
due to inherent limitations of var  including the use of approximations to value options  subjectivity in the choice of liquidation period and reliance on historical data to calibrate the model  the var calculation may not accurately reflect allegheny s and ae supply s market risk exposure 
as a result  changes in allegheny s and ae supply s market risk sensitive instruments could differ from the calculated var  and these changes could have a material effect on allegheny s and ae supply s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in addition to var  allegheny and ae supply routinely perform stress and scenario analyses to measure extreme losses due to exceptional events 
allegheny and ae supply review the var and stress test results to determine the maximum expected reduction in the fair value of the entire energy markets portfolio 

table of contents ae supply s exit from the western us energy markets has decreased both the magnitude and length of ae supply s net open positions of its commodity contract trading portfolio  which had a corresponding decrease in calculated var 
ae supply calculated var using the full term of all remaining wholesale energy market positions that are accounted for as marked to market 
this calculation is based upon management s best estimates and modeling assumptions  which could materially differ from actual results 
as of december  and  this calculation yielded a var of million and million  respectively 
monongahela power company and subsidiaries monongahela is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices that result from market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity and natural gas 
monongahela is subject to capped rates in west virginia 
monongahela agreed to terminate its fuel clause in west virginia effective july  the purpose of the fuel clause  which allowed monongahela to recoup certain fuel costs through customer rates  had been to offset fluctuations in the market price of fuel 
in order to manage its financial exposure to these price fluctuations in the absence of a fuel clause  monongahela enters into contracts  such as fuel purchase commitments 
to the extent that monongahela purchases fuel at significantly higher prices  monongahela s results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
in connection with its restructuring plan in ohio  monongahela separated its rates in ohio into three separate charges a generation or supply charge  a restructuring transition charge and t d charges
