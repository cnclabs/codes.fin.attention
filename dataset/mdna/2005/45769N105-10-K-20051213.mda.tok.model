critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company s most critical accounting policies are revenue recognition  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and warranty reserves 
the company recognizes sales for products when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes sales upon shipment of products to customers 
sales related to certain long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over several years are accounted for under the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we consider the nature of these contracts as well as the types of products and services provided when determining the appropriate accounting treatment for a particular contract 
certain long term contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis using cost to cost methodology to measure progress toward completion 
the company offers its customers extended warranties for additional fees

effective july   the company identifies all goods and or services that are to be delivered separately under a sales arrangement and allocates revenue to each deliverable based on fair value that is established with the customer during contract negotiations 
in general  revenues are separated between product sales and non recurring engineering services 
the allocated revenue for each deliverable is then recognized using appropriate revenue recognition methods

the impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws  if any  applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled  are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are determined by analyzing historical data and trends 
if actual losses are greater than estimated amounts or if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  future results from operations could be adversely affected 
inventories are written down for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we offer warranties on some products of various lengths 
at the time of shipment  we establish a reserve for the estimated cost of warranties based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims using historical data on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
the length of the warranty period  the product s failure rates and the customer s usage affects warranty cost 
if the actual cost of warranties differs from our estimated amounts  future results of operations could be adversely affected

business segments the company operates in one principal business segment which designs  manufactures and sells flight information computers  large flat panel displays and advanced monitoring systems to the dod  government agencies  defense contractors  commercial air transport carriers and corporate general aviation markets 
the company currently derives virtually all of its revenues from the sale of this equipment 
almost all of the company s sales  operating results and identifiable assets are in the united states 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash equivalents and an industrial revenue bond 
the company s cash equivalents consist of funds invested in money market accounts  which bear interest at a variable rate  while the industrial revenue bond carries an interest rate that is consistent with day tax exempt commercial paper 
as the interest rates are variable  a change in interest rates earned on the cash equivalents or paid on the industrial revenue bond  would impact interest income and expense along with cash flows  but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments
