item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k  including the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements that may involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from those discussed herein 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item business summary of business considerations and certain risk factors that may affect future results of operations and or stock price 
the following discussion should be read together with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the company is engaged in the design  manufacture  and marketing of wireless communications products and systems and information security products 
through efjohnson  the company designs  develops  manufactures  and markets stationary lmr transmitters receivers base stations or repeaters  mobile and portable radios  and lmr systems 
through transcrypt  the company primarily designs and manufactures information security products that prevent unauthorized access to sensitive voice communications  and  to a lesser degree  transcrypt also designs  manufactures  and markets lmr signaling accessory products 
these products are based on a wide range of analog scrambling and digital encryption technologies and are sold mainly to the lmr security markets 
the company primarily sells its products to domestic public safety public service and other government users  commercial users  and international customers 
since implementation of a new strategic plan in  the company has been focused on restoring growth and profitability via significant transitions in product mix and strategy 
the company s ongoing product strategy  at its efjohnson subsidiary  has been to exit certain lower margin analog product lines  including ltr and ltr net product lines  and to focus efjohnson s resources on apco product lines 
this product strategy entailed a substantial exit from the commercial market  and an emphasis on the domestic public safety public service sector  thereby allowing the company to focus its resources on the markets and products that the company believes have the most potential for sustained profitability 
the company plans to continue this product strategy in  modifying it only to the degree that the company continues to allocate an increasing share of its on going research and development costs on its project systems infrastructure 
the company anticipates that lmr systems revenue will be a material part of its efjohnson s revenues in and beyond 
the company s strategy at its transcrypt subsidiary has been to leverage its dominant marketing position in analog encryption to gain new customers in parts of the world where lmr systems tend to be analog and security needs are substantially high 
transcrypt has also initiated development of analog encryption products that use digital technology in order to obtain higher levels of security  these products not only meet higher security needs  but allow for backward compatibility between transcrypt s digital and analog encryption modules 
the company intends to maintain its globally focused marketing strategy through results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations information as a percentage of revenues during the periods indicated 
year ended december  revenues cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative facility move expenses stock option repricing adjustment total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income expense  net other income income tax benefit net income revenues vs 
revenues increased by in  to million  as compared to million in of the total revenues for  the wireless communication segment revenues comprised million  or of total revenues  and the information security segment revenues comprised million  or of total revenues 
wireless communication wireless communication revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in this increase was the result of increased sales to the federal government and to state and local governmental entities  million and million in and  respectively  as efjohnson continued to focus its efforts on the domestic public safety public service segment 
the company also experienced increases in its international and commercial market segments international sales increased to million  from million  and commercial sales increased to million  from million 
in the aggregate  sales to international and commercial markets continued to decline as a percent of total efjohnson sales  to in  as compared to in management presently does not expect any material changes in its future wireless communication sales mix as the company s current product offerings are focused on digital project subscriber needs and marketing efforts are focused on domestic governmental entities 
management expects efjohnson s revenues to increase by to over its revenue level in the overall revenue mix  in terms of market segment and sales to the domestic governmental entities  is not expected to be materially different from information security information security revenues increased substantially to million in  as compared to million in this represents a increase  the increase primarily coming from increased sales to the middle east  predominantly iraq 
transcrypt intends to maintain its increased marketing efforts in the middle east  asia and latin america where the movement to digital lmr products is expected to be delayed for several years and where security concerns are high 
additionally  the company is presently developing a product capable of digitally encrypting analog signals in order to enhance the level of transmission security 
management anticipates that transcrypt revenues will increase by to in over its revenue level in vs 
revenues increased by in  to million  as compared to million in of the total revenues for  the wireless communication segment revenues comprised million  or of total revenues  and the information security segment revenues comprised million  or of total revenues 
the increased sales in related primarily to sales to the federal government  such sales comprising of the company s total revenues in versus in wireless communication wireless communication revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in this increase was primarily the result of increased sales to the federal government as efjohnson continued to focus its efforts on the domestic public safety public service segment  primarily the federal government user  and decrease its emphasis on the international and commercial market segments 
information security information security revenues increased slightly to million in  as compared to million in  an overall increase of only 
international sales international sales substantially relate to transcrypt  which accounted for and of the company s international sales in and  respectively 
in international sales were  respectively  million at transcrypt and million at efjohnson  or a total of million 
in  international sales were  respectively  million at transcrypt and million at efjohnson  or a total of million 
the increase in international sales  from to  was as follows increase in revenues from the central and latin america regions  million in versus million in  increase in revenues from the middle east and asia regions  million in versus million in  the increase resulting substantially from sales to iraq  decrease in revenues from the european market  million in versus million in gross profit cost of sales includes materials  labor  depreciation and overhead costs associated with the production of the company s products  as well as shipping  royalty  and warranty product costs 
gross profit was million gross margin in  as compared to million gross margin in  and million gross margin in gross margins for the wireless communications segment were in  in  and in gross margins for the information security segment were in  in  and in the increase in overall gross margins from to relates strictly to the higher margin information security sales being a larger part of the sales mix in as compared to  that is  in versus in the relatively small decrease in overall gross margins from to relates primarily to the lower margin wireless communication sales being a larger part of the sales mix in as compared to  that is  in versus in the increase in transcrypt s margin  from to  relates substantially to economies of scale reached at the materially higher sales levels in efjohnson  to the contrary  saw its margin erode  from in to in  despite a growth in revenues 
much of this erosion is attributed to lower productivity at efjohnson s waseca  minnesota plant subsequent to the announcement to close the facility and other inefficiencies resulting from the transition to outsourcing its production 
management believes that these inefficiencies will continue through the first quarter of  when the relocation is complete  and should not be replicated thereafter 
further  as a result of increased product complexity  the company s warranty costs increased such that margins were effectively reduced by of 
the company is not able to ascertain whether this increased warranty rate will continue to be applicable to future sales or whether the company  through improved design and production efforts  can reduce the warranty rate in the future 
management is continuing to review pricing strategies and product line profitability at both segments 
management intends to make adjustments to its product offerings  where deemed appropriate  to include elimination of marginally profitable products and product lines 
management also expects that its decisions to outsource its manufacturing will result in continued production efficiencies in and beyond 
nonetheless  anticipated higher component costs at transcrypt are expected to hold margins in at a level consistent with that experienced on a consolidated basis in research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with research and development personnel  materials  and the depreciation of research and development equipment and facilities 
the company expenses all research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses were million in  as compared to million in and million in as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses were of revenues in  of revenues in  and of revenues in during  the company s research and development costs were substantially focused on the company s new line of digital radios 
in  the company s research and development efforts were concentrated on enhancements and additions to the company s line of digital radios that continue to comply with project standards 
in  the company s research and development efforts concentrated on developing trunked project system infrastructure  including repeaters  voters  and base stations  developing new digital mid tier subscriber units both portable and mobile  and the company s project regarding digital encryption of analog transmissions 
research and development priorities in are expected to parallel those in the company anticipates that its research and development costs in will approximate to of revenues 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of sales personnel  including sales commissions and travel expenses  as well as costs of advertising  public relations and trade show participation 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  as compared to million in and million in as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expenses were of revenues in and  and in the higher percentage in  as compared to and  was substantially due to unusually higher external commissions to non employee dealers and representatives incurred on sales at both segments in the company anticipates that its sales and marketing expenses in will approximate to of revenues 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other expenses associated with the company s management  accounting  finance and administrative functions  and amortization of intangible assets 
general and administrative expenses were million in  as compared to million in and million in much of the differences between the respective years are due to non cash compensation relating to repriced options and the company s facility moves  both issues explained below 
general and administrative expenses  adjusted for non cash compensation expenses relating to repriced options and facility move expenses  were million in  as compared to million in and million in as a percent of revenues  general and administrative expenses were of revenues in  as compared to of revenues in  and of revenues in the increased general and administrative expenses in  as compared to  over and above that amount which relates to the company s overall growth in  results primarily from the company s compliance with section of sox 
the company incurred approximately  in expenses in its efforts to comply with section  and the company expects to incur a similar amount in the increased general and administrative expenses in  as compared to related substantially to the company s overall growth in excluding non cash compensation expense relating to the repriced options and facility move expenses  management anticipates that general and administrative expenses for will be increased over that experienced in by an amount approximating to of the amount that sales increase in as compared to additionally  the company expects general and administrative expenses to be increased by approximately  per quarter in both the third and fourth quarters of as a result of adherence to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment see recently issued accounting standards below at this item 
non cash compensation relating to repriced options in and  the company repriced certain of its stock option to a price which represented of the then prevailing stock price  that is  an exercise price of per share 
these required options are subject to variable accounting treatment  such that an increase in the company s stock price above the repriced exercise price potentially creates a non cash compensation expense 
the company s stock price at december    and  respectively  was  and per share 
the company s non cash compensation expense from these repriced options was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
to the extent the repriced stock option situation discussed above does not materially change in  each change in the market price of the company s common stock from the price per share as of december  will cause  as applicable  a non cash benefit or expense of approximately  the company presently expects these repriced options to be substantially exercised by june   accordingly  the company does not expect any material stock repricing adjustments subsequent to the second quarter of facility move costs as explained in note to the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements  the company made a decision to move both its operating facilities 
the total cost incurred in to this end  was million  million related to moving transcrypt s operations from one facility in lincoln  nebraska to another facility in the same general vicinity  and million related to the move of efjohnson s operations from waseca  minnesota to irving  texas 
the transcrypt move was completed in  the efjohnson move is expected to be complete in april approximately million of costs are expected to be incurred in to complete the efjohnson move 
no similar costs were incurred by the company in or net interest income or expense net interest income expense consists of interest income earned on cash and invested funds  net of interest expense related to amounts payable on its term and installment loans and bank line of credit 
net interest income expense was  in and  in  as compared to  in the company s interest expense in and includes approximately  of amortized loan fees  which skews the interest expense relationship 
the company expects net interest income in to be increased over the amount incurred in  as a result of increasing cash balances  assuming that interest rates remain relatively unchanged 
other income expense  net net other income expense for   and  respectively  was   and  the amount in included  of insurance proceeds received in relation to a claim for stolen property 
excluding this non recurring event  the amounts recorded in the three years are similarly immaterial  as would be expected 
the company would expect that other income expense in to remain at an insignificant level 
provision for income taxes the company s income tax benefit was million and million in and  respectively  as compared to zero in as of december   the company has million in deferred tax assets before valuation allowance of million 
the valuation reserve is based upon management s conclusions regarding  among other considerations  the company s operating results during   and  its current and expected customer base  technological and competitive factors impacting its current products  and management s estimates of future earnings based on information currently available 
current financial accounting standards require that organizations analyze all positive and negative evidence relating to deferred tax asset realization  which would include the company s historical accuracy in forecasting future earnings  as well as the company s history of losses prior to should factors underlying management s estimates change  future adjustments  either positive or negative  to the company s valuation allowance may be necessary 
the company s tax asset is principally composed of net operating loss carryforwards nol s 
these nol s total million at december  and do not begin to expire until the company s deferred tax asset of million  as of december   is comprised of the following components tax asset component in millions net operating loss carryforwards timing differences book to tax general business tax credits less valuation allowance in the fourth quarters of   and  the company reduced its deferred tax asset valuation allowance  effectively recognizing a deferred tax asset of million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
the respective decisions to decrease the valuation allowance were based upon the company s expectations of future earnings in light of earnings  excluding the impact of non cash compensation resulting from repriced stock options  in  and  and excluding costs incurred in in relation to facility moves for both of the company s operating subsidiaries 
any future adjustments in the company s deferred tax asset allowance  and corresponding increases or decreases in the company s deferred tax asset  will  likewise  be recorded  respectively  as income tax benefits or expenses 
the company cannot presently estimate what changes to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be deemed appropriate in and beyond 
in determining recoverability of the future tax benefits associated with its deferred tax asset  management takes into account  among other factors  the company s historical operating results  its current and expected customer base  technological and competitive factors impacting its current products  and management s estimates of future earnings which are based upon a five year earnings projection  using information currently available  and discounted for risk 
accordingly  as management presently anticipates that the company will continue its recent trend of profitability in  management expects that some portion  if not all  of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will continue to be reduced in conversely  if the company incurs future losses  it may be necessary to increase the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset recorded at december  net income the company had net income of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the amounts in and included tax benefits of and million  respectively  no tax benefit or expense  however  was recorded in operating results were adversely affected in each year by non cash compensation expense resulting from variable accounting treatment required for certain of the company s stock options repriced in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  in   and  respectively  the amount of this expense was million  million and million 
additionally  in  the company incurred million in costs related to moving its operating subsidiaries 
the table below illustrates the operating results of   and  adjusting for the non cash items ie  tax benefit and stock option repricing effect and facility relocation expense as discussed above 
the company believes that such presentation offers a more comparative measurement of the company s operating results 
when adjusting for the aforementioned items  the adjusted income is million in  million in  and million in this reflects an earnings increase of in  as compared to  and in as compared to operating results in millions net income income tax benefit stock repricing compensation expense facility relocation expense adjusted income comparative basis adjusted income as a percentage of total revenues quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain unaudited financial information in dollars and as a percentage of revenues for the company for the eight quarters ended december  in the opinion of the company s management  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary to present fairly the unaudited results set forth herein

represents benefit from reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of and the timing of the company s changes in the estimate was dependent upon the relative certainty of factors considered by management 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company historically has experienced substantial variability in its results of operations from quarter to quarter 
the level of revenues in a particular quarter varies primarily based upon the timing of customer purchase orders  due principally to the seasonal nature of governmental budgeting processes and the needs of competing budgetary concerns of the company s customers during the year 
other factors that affect the results of operations in a particular quarter include the timing of the introduction of new products  general economic conditions  the timing and mix of product sales and specific economic conditions in the wireless communications and information security industries 
the company believes that quarterly results are likely to vary for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operating activities provided used cash of million  million  and million in   and the amount of cash provided from operations before changes in components of working capital was million  million  and million in   and cash provided used by changes in components of working capital was million  million  and million  the material differences among the years substantially resulting from changes in accounts receivables  inventory and accounts payable 
these changes related to the timing of sales orders  causing a corresponding buildup or shipment of inventory  which accounted for million of the cash provided by changes in components of working capital 
at december   the company was managing a decrease in its inventory in conjunction with the outsourcing of manufacturing at both its operating segments 
during  the company s inventory increased in preparation of substantial shipments scheduled for january  while its receivables increased as a result of substantial december sales 
during  the company used million in investing activities  approximately million related to the purchase of fixed assets  which was partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of fixed assets and a million decrease in other assets  primarily prepaid royalties

during  the company used million in financing activities  substantially relating to net payments made on its line of credit 
the company s cash position and overall working capital position were significantly improved as of december   as compared to december  this was the result of company s profitable operation in  as well as the aforementioned decrease in the company s inventory balance

the company s only outstanding letter of credit  which expires in june  has a total undrawn balance of  on december  bonds  which expire on various dates  totaled million at december  the company s current bonding arrangement calls for zero collateral bonding up to million  however  no single bond may exceed million 
the company believes its bonding arrangements provide it with sufficient bonding availability through  however  the company continues to seek improved bonding alternatives with increased limits as bonding requirements are expected to increase parallel with the company s anticipated growth in lmr systems revenue  significantly in and beyond 
the company also leases various equipment and buildings under operating leases 
future minimum rental payments under non cancelable operating lease agreements are shown below in the tabular disclosure of contractual obligations 
of the million total operating lease obligations  million relate to the leases of the company s operating facilities for transcrypt which lease runs through june and efjohnson which lease runs through december 
the company anticipates that  in the normal course of business  leases will be renewed or replaced as they expire 
in september  the company entered into an amendment of its secured line of credit with bank of america 
the maximum line of credit availability was increased from million to million  and the line s interest rate was decreased from a rate of libor plus basis points to a rate of libor plus basis points 
the line of credit is collateralized by substantially all the company s assets  and borrowings available under the line of credit are calculated as a percentage of eligible inventory and receivables 
this amended revolving line of credit expires in september and contains certain financial covenants with which the company was in compliance at december  at december   the company had zero outstanding on the revolving line of credit as compared to million at december  the total available line of credit was million at december  the company currently does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future

item legal proceedings 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
revised requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based upon the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value based method is substantially similar to the method established in sfas no 
and includes use of the black scholes option pricing model 
that fair value will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  generally the option s vesting period 
sfas no 
revised is effective for interim or annual reporting periods that begin after june  the company will adopt sfas no 
revised as of the quarter ending september  the company presently expects such adoption to increase its expenses by approximately  in both the third and fourth quarters of in december  fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
sfas no 
eliminates apb no 
s exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity 
this pronouncement is not anticipated to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november  fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
the statement clarifies the fasb s position that abnormal amounts of costs  such as idle freight  handling costs  or spoilage  should be recognized as current period costs and requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to costs of conversion be based upon the normal capacity of the production facilities 
since  heretofore  the company had already been costing its inventory in accordance with the methodology required by sfas no 
 this pronouncement is not anticipated to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles usgaap requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
the company regularly evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare its financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  application of the percentage of completion accounting for long term contract revenues  inventory reserves  valuation allowance for deferred income tax asset  and contingencies 
these estimates are based on historical experience and various assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the particular applicable facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers its critical accounting policies to be those that i involve significant judgments and uncertainties  ii require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine and iii have the potential to result in materially different outcomes under varying assumptions and conditions 
the application of gaap may require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying results 
listed below are those policies the company believes are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
revenue the company s revenue recognition policy is in accordance with the criteria put forth in staff accounting bulletins and revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete  less an estimate for an allowance for returns  if applicable  if collection is reasonably assured 
the earnings process is generally complete when the product is shipped  or received by the customer  depending upon whether the title to the goods  as well as the risks and benefits of ownership  are transferred to the customer at point of shipment or point of delivery 
for sales where collection is not reasonably assured  the company recognizes revenue as cash is received 
if collection is contingent on a future event  the company recognizes revenue when the contingency lapses  generally upon cash collection 
system sales under long term contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
under this method  revenues are recognized as work on a contract progresses 
the recognized revenue is that percentage of estimated total revenue that incurred costs to date bear to estimated total costs to complete the contract 
revisions in cost and profit estimates are made when conditions requiring such revisions become known 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in operations as soon as such losses are determined to be probable and reasonably estimable 
deferred revenue includes unearned services provided under systems maintenance contracts and unearned warranty fees on extended product warranty contracts sold to customers 
the company recognizes the fees based upon a straight line method over the life of the contract 
the company periodically reviews its revenue recognition procedures to assure that such procedures are in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletins and inventory inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
the company periodically assesses its inventory for potential obsolescence and lower of cost or market issues 
the company makes estimates of inventory obsolescence  providing reserves when necessary  based on  among other factors  demand for inventory based on backlog  product pricing  the ability to liquidate or sell older inventory  and the impact of introducing new products 
charges associated with providing for inventory obsolescence  or revisions to related reserves  have historically correlated with selling activity and have had a consistent impact on the company s gross margins over the last three fiscal years 
goodwill in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment  on at least an annual basis  by applying a fair value based test 
the company adopted the provisions sfas no 
effective january  at least annually  the company assesses goodwill  using a fair value based test  consistent with sfas no 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  goodwill is considered to be impaired 
in evaluating impairment  the company estimates the sum of the expected future cash flows derived from such goodwill 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
the estimates use assumptions about the company s market segment share in the future and about future expenditures by government entities for wireless communications products 
the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
if the company fails to deliver new products  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if the company fails to achieve assumed revenue growth rates or assumed gross margin  the company may incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent that recoverability of tax assets is not considered likely 
in determining recoverability of the future tax benefits associated with its deferred tax asset  management takes into account  among other factors  the company s historical operating results  its current and expected customer base  technological and competitive factos impacting its current products  and management s estimates of future earnings which are based upon a five year earnings projection  using information currently available  and discounted for risk 
if the company fails to achieve revenue growth rates or gross margins assumed in the calculation of the deferred tax asset  the company may be required to increase its valuation allowance in the future 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company reviews its long lived assets  to include intangible assets subject to amortization  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such long lived asset or group of long lived assets collectively referred to as the asset may not be recoverable 
such circumstances include  but are not limited to significant decrease in the market price of the asset  significant change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used  significant change in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  current period losses combined with projection of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  current expectation that  more likely than not  the asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred 
when such events or circumstances exist  the recoverability of the asset s carrying value shall be determined by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows cash inflows less associated cash outflows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
to date  no such impairment has occurred 
to the extent such events or circumstances occur that could affect the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  the company may incur charges for impairment in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although all of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in the value of international currencies relative to the us dollar may affect the price  competitiveness and profitability of the company s products sold in international markets 
furthermore  the uncertainty of monetary exchange values has caused  and may in the future cause  some foreign customers to delay new orders or delay payment for existing orders 
additionally  troubled economic conditions  such as that recently experienced in asia and in latin america  could result in lower revenues for the company 
while most international sales are supported by letters of credit  the purchase of company products by international customers presents increased risks  which include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  political and economic instability in foreign markets  difficulties in establishing foreign distribution channels  longer payment cycles and or uncertainty in the collection of accounts receivable  increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts  cultural differences in the conduct of business  natural disasters or acts of terrorism  difficulties in protecting intellectual property  and susceptibility to orders being cancelled as a result of foreign currency fluctuations since all the company quotations and invoices are denominated in us dollars 
some of the company s information security products are subject to export controls under us law  which in most cases requires the approval of the department of commerce in order to ship internationally 
the company cannot assure that such approvals will be available to it or its products in the future in a timely manner or at all or that the federal government will not revise its export policies or the list of products and countries for which export approval is required 
the company s inability to obtain required export approvals would adversely affect the company s international sales  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  foreign companies not subject to united states export restrictions may have a competitive advantage in the international information security market 
the company cannot predict the impact of these factors on the international market for its products
