item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
all dollar and share amounts are in millions  except per share and per lyon data 
forward looking information some of the statements in this md a constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our businesses or our industries actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward looking statements 
such statements include  in particular  statements about our plans  strategies  prospects  changes and trends in our business and the markets in which we operate 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  could  would  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential or continue or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
actual events or results may differ materially because of market conditions in our industries or other factors 
all of the forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed in this md a under factors that may affect future results and any documents incorporated by reference that describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements 
we caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive 
we operate in a continually changing business environment and frequently enter into new business and product lines  and new risk factors emerge from time to time 
we cannot predict these new risk factors  nor can we assess the impact  if any  of these new risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
accordingly  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results 
in addition  management s estimates of future operating results are based on our current complement of businesses  which is subject to change as management selects strategic markets 
executive overview as part of our operating philosophy  we continually review our businesses and selected markets 
we regularly review and negotiate potential acquisitions and divestitures in the ordinary course of business  some of which are or may be material  and we have completed numerous acquisitions and divestitures over the last several years 
all of our decisions regarding acquisitions and divestitures are based on an economic cash flow model 
we may consider larger acquisitions of businesses with more than  in annual revenues  if certain criteria are met 
we also consider business divestitures when we believe the business has a better strategic fit with another company that increases the overall cash flow returns to our investors 
over the last three years  we have invested in bolt on acquisitions  including in for six acquisitions 
in the last three years we have realized proceeds from assets sales and business divestitures of  including in our primary divestures in were the sale of our municipal water valve and axial fan businesses 
overall  was a disappointing year 
we believe that much of the disappointment in was the result of the need to improve on basic business fundamentals within certain of our operations 
in response  in part  to these operating matters  we reorganized our executive management team in december  which included  among other things  the appointment of co coo s 
other matters of note in and through february include despite an overall increase in organic revenues of  gross margins declined during the year primarily as a result of increased commodity costs  changes in product and customer mix within certain of our businesses  and operating inefficiencies within certain of our businesses 
we continued to increase our presence in foreign markets 
specifically  we currently have offices and approximately  employees in china 
we recorded charges in of related to the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets associated with our dock products  fluid power  radiodetection  and tps businesses 
we incurred incremental legal and other professional fees of in associated with legal costs relating primarily to the vsi litigation  shareholder class action suit  and the italian investigation  as well as  accounting and other costs related to the implementation of regulatory requirements associated with the sarbanes oxley act of in connection with the retirement and resignation of our then chairman  ceo  and president in december  we entered into a separation agreement with him that resulted in a net charge in of approximately  which is net of a credit of associated with compensation previously recorded for restricted stock that was forfeited as part of the separation agreement 
we experienced a significant increase in pension costs in  as pension expense  including of curtailment losses  totaled in compared to pension income in  including of curtailment gains  of there was a significant decrease in incentive compensation expense in due to lower profitability during the year and the fact that nine members of our senior management group agreed to forego their incentive compensation 
incentive compensation for our senior management group totaled approximately in in  we reduced our income tax provision by and reduced goodwill by associated with changes in estimates of income tax liabilities 
these changes in estimates resulted from the closure of certain matters with the internal revenue service irs relating to the to income tax returns of general signal corporation and spx corporation and the income tax return of udi 
during december  we repatriated capital and taxable earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of  with the taxable earnings totaling we provided taxes on these earnings of approximately in in  we intend to repatriate of foreign undistributed earnings under the provisions of the american jobs creation act ajca of prior to  income taxes had been provided for undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries 
these taxes totaled approximately as of the end of the third quarter of and had been established at tax rates that are higher than those under the ajca provisions 
we currently estimate that the tax cost for the repatriation will be approximately  including the tax cost on the repatriation of the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were not considered indefinitely invested 
accordingly  we have recorded a net tax benefit for these matters of in operating cash flows from continuing operations totaled in  a decline from of much of this decline was attributable to investments in working capital associated with organic growth within certain of our businesses 
in addition  operating cash flows included proceeds of related to the settlement of a patent infringement suit 
cash costs of related to the settlement were paid in on january   we paid down of our tranche a term loan and of our tranche b term loan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the pay down of the tranche a and b term loans 
in connection with the pay down of the tranche a and b term loans  we terminated interest rate swap contracts 
these instruments were included in the portfolio of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of our variable rate debt portfolio 
because the future interest payments hedged by swaps with a notional amount of were no longer probable of occurring  we recognized in interest expense in to reclassify into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income the fair value of the related swaps 
in february  we announced that we had commenced cash tender offers to purchase any and all of the outstanding senior notes and the senior notes the notes  as well as the consent solicitations to amend the indenture governing each series of senior notes 
the consent solicitation and tender offers will expire on march   unless we extend them  and are subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  including the sale of the est business 
in the event we are successful in purchasing all of the notes  we will record charges of approximately for premium and fees paid to redeem the notes and for the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the cash tender offer for the notes 
we signed definitive agreements to sell for cash our bomag  est  and kendro business units for   and  respectively 
the bomag transaction closed in january  while the est and kendro transactions are expected to close by the end of the first and second quarters of  respectively 
with the closing of the bomag transaction  as well as the anticipated closing of the est and kendro transactions in the first and second quarters of  respectively  we expect to have significant available liquidity to allow us the flexibility to revise our capital structure  invest in technology and our businesses  and make acquisitions 
specifically  we expect to generate net proceeds from these three transactions of approximately  we intend to use these proceeds  along with cash generated from operations  to pay down debt and repurchase equity in business segment information we are a global multi industry company that is focused on profitably growing our businesses that have scale and growth potential 
our strategy is to create market advantages through technology  service  and product leadership  by expanding our market focus to offer full customer solutions and by building critical mass through strategic acquisitions 
we aggregate certain operating segments in accordance with the criteria defined in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the primary aggregation factors considered in determining the segments are the nature of the products sold  production processes  and types of customers for these products 
in determining our segments  we apply the threshold criteria of sfas no 
to operating income or loss of each segment before considering special charges  including those recorded in cost of products sold 
this is consistent with the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the results of each segment 
our results of operations are reported in five segments cooling technologies and services  flow technology  service solutions  industrial products and services  and technical products and systems 
in  we reported revenues of  compared to  in  an increase of 
organic revenues  which are revenues excluding acquisitions or dispositions and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  increased approximately in compared to the increase in organic revenues was a result of a number of factors including  but not limited to increased demand within our service solutions segment for dealer equipment service and aftermarket mechanical tools and higher global demand for original equipment tools  strong product demand in asia and thermal components and service revenue in europe and asia relating to our cooling technologies and services segment  and an overall improvement in global economic conditions 
approximately of our revenues were generated from business units in non us countries in accordingly  we are subject to the translation impact of changes in the us dollar relative to other global currencies 
the primary foreign currencies where we do business are the euro  pounds sterling and canadian dollar 
in  favorable currency translation increased reported revenues by approximately 
the following table highlights our segment performance in the markets they serve  and our expectations for based on information available at the time of this report 
we define forecasted trends as follows growth future end market performance is expected to be above the prior year  flat future end market performance is expected to be flat compared to the prior year  decline future end market performance is expected to be below the prior year 
segment annual forecasted trend comments cooling technologies and services growth organic revenues for the segment increased primarily as a result of product demand in asia and thermal components and service revenue in europe and asia 
we expect further product expansion in asia and service expansion in europe and asia for the segment in flow technology growth organic revenue for the segment was flat in growth was hindered in by operating inefficiencies within our air treatment and valves and controls groups of businesses 
we expect organic growth within the segment for fueled by global expansion  primarily in asia  new product introductions  pricing  and more efficient operations within our air treatment and valves and controls businesses 
service solutions flat organic revenues for the segment increased by in primarily as a result of increased demand for dealer equipment service and aftermarket mechanical tools and higher global demand for original equipment tools 
we expect minimal  if any  organic growth within the segment in as a result of an expected reduction in new oem platform rollouts 
industrial products and services decline organic growth for the segment increased by in primarily as a result of increased demand for power equipment at our waukesha electric systems business and increased revenues at our dock products business associated with price increases and new product introductions 
we expect organic revenues to remain flat or to decline slightly within the segment in technical products and systems decline organic growth for the segment decreased in primarily due to delays in the digital television broadcasting rollout in the us  lower demand for telecommunications line management systems  and lower service revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in revenues within our gfi genfare business due to the timing of contracts and vance business as a result of increased demand for security protection services associated with the middle east conflict and the summer olympics 
volumes at gfi genfare are highly correlated to the timing of large contracts with municipalities  which can cause fluctuations in revenues for the business from period to period 
we expect organic revenues to decline in due primarily to the timing of contracts at our gfi genfare business 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales either upon shipment to the customer fob shipping point or upon receipt by the customer fob destination  except for revenues from service contracts and long term maintenance arrangements  which are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the agreement period  and revenues from certain construction and installation contracts  which are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
sales with fob destination terms are primarily with automotive industry customers 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue is recognized based on effort or costs incurred to date as compared to total estimated effort or cost of the total contract 
we realize profit at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project 
these estimates and actual experience may vary based on design changes  engineering change orders  cost over or under runs and other related events 
in  we recognized of revenue under the percentage of completion method compared to in accounts receivable included and of amounts not yet billed under these contracts at december  and  respectively 
this accounting method is used primarily by our cooling technologies and services segment to record revenue related to the field construction of cooling towers 
certain sales to distributors made with return rights are recognized upon shipment to the customer 
expected returns under these arrangements are estimated and accrued for at the time of sale 
the accrual considers restocking charges for returns and in some cases the customer must issue a replacement order before the return is authorized 
actual return experience may vary from our estimates 
amounts billed for shipping and handling are included in revenue 
in addition  costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of products sold and not netted against amounts billed 
employee benefit plans we have defined benefit pension plans that cover a significant portion of our salaried and hourly paid employees  including certain employees in foreign countries 
beginning in january  we discontinued providing such pension benefits generally to newly hired employees 
in addition  we no longer provide service credits to certain active participants 
of the us employees covered by a defined benefit pension and actively accruing a benefit  most are covered by an account balance plan or are part of a collectively bargained plan 
we have domestic postretirement plans that provide health and life insurance benefits for certain retirees and their dependents 
some of these plans require retiree contributions at varying rates 
not all retirees are eligible to receive these benefits  with eligibility governed by the plan s in effect at a particular location 
effective january   we implemented a uniform plan design for certain non union employees retiring after january  also effective january   we implemented a minimum employee contribution for all current  non union retirees 
on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act  was signed into law 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare benefit offered under the act 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial staff position fsp sfas no 
accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp sfas no 
superceded fsp sfas no 
and provides disclosure and accounting guidance for the federal subsidy that will be given to health care plan sponsors who provide specified levels of postretirement healthcare prescription benefits 
in the third quarter of  we adopted the provisions of fsp sfas no 
and made the determination that our postretirement healthcare prescription benefits qualified for the federal subsidy 
as a result  measures of the accumulated postretirement obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost for include the effect of the act on our plans 
this adoption of fsp sfas resulted in a reduction in our net periodic benefit cost related to our postretirement plans of for the year ended december  we recorded net pension expense of in and net pension income of in and in the calculation of pension benefit expense income uses an expected rate of return on plan assets 
the difference between the estimated return and the actual return is treated as an unrecognized gain or loss  and this amount is amortized into the calculation of pension results in future periods 
in addition  we recorded curtailment losses of in and curtailment gains of and in and  respectively  due to certain workforce reductions 
the aggregate unrecognized loss position of our pension plans was and at december  and  respectively 
the unrecognized loss position of our plans was unfavorably impacted in by the continued low interest rates  which required a decrease in our discount rate assumption for both our expense recognition and our projected benefit obligation as of december  future net pension expense or income is dependent upon many factors  including level of employee participation in the plans  plan amendments  actuarial assumptions and the changes in market value of the plans assets  which  in turn  depends on a variety of economic conditions 
we currently expect that future periods will include pension expense and not pension income 
based on an assumed expected long term rate of return on assets of for and our current unrecognized loss position  we expect net pension expense to increase by approximately in the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates 
the funded status of our pension plans as of december  has deteriorated since december  as a result of lower returns on our plan assets and a further decline in interest rates  primarily in the us financial markets 
our non funded pension plans account for of the total underfunded status at december   as these plans are not required to be funded 
the underfunded status of our primary domestic pension plans did not require us to make cash contributions in we fund us pension plans in amounts equal to the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of  plus additional amounts that may be approved from time to time 
we did not make any contributions to our primary domestic plans in in  we do not expect to make any payments to our primary domestic pension plans 
an additional minimum pension liability adjustment is required when the accumulated benefit obligation of a plan exceeds plan assets and accrued pension liabilities 
this adjustment also requires the elimination of any previously recorded prepaid pension asset 
the minimum liability adjustment  less allowable intangible assets  is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
however  in a year in which the plan assets exceed the accumulated benefit obligation of the plan  any pension adjustments previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income are removed and any net prepaid pension asset is restored 
the total pension adjustment amount recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive income account was  net of tax  for the year ended december  actuarial assumptions used in accounting for our pension plans are as follows year ended december  weighted average actuarial assumptions used in determining net periodic pension expense income discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels expected long term rate of return on assets domestic pension plans expected long term rate of return on assets foreign pension plans weighted average actuarial assumptions used in determining year end benefit obligations discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels it is our policy to review the pension assumptions annually 
pension benefit income or expense is determined using assumptions as of the beginning of the year  while the funded status is determined using assumptions as of the end of the year 
the assumptions are determined by management and established at the respective balance sheet date using the following principles the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is established based upon historical actual asset returns and the expectations of asset returns over the expected period to fund participant benefits based on the current investment mix of our plans  the discount rate is set based on the yield of high quality fixed income investments expected to be available in the future when pension benefits are paid high quality fixed income investments are commonly defined as fixed income investments with at least a moody s aa credit rating  and the rate of increase in compensation levels is established based on management s expectations of current and foreseeable future increases in compensation 
in addition  management also considers advice from independent actuaries 
a one percentage point increase or decrease to the assumed expected long term rate of return of our primary domestic pension plans would have a relative effect on net pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return assumption for the pension benefit income calculation is expected to be 
special charges  net as part of our business strategy  we right size and consolidate operations to drive results 
accordingly  from time to time we alter our business model to better serve customer demand  fix or discontinue lower margin product lines and rationalize and consolidate manufacturing capacity 
additionally  we continually review whether events and circumstances subsequent to the acquisition of any long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of those assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of those assets may not be recoverable 
this continual review is in addition to our annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles that we perform in the fourth quarter in connection with our annual long range forecasting process 
as a result of the above processes  we recorded net charges of in  in and in these net special charges were for asset impairments  including of non disposal asset impairments recorded at our fluid power and contech businesses in in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 and for restructuring initiatives to consolidate manufacturing and sales facilities  reduce our work force and rationalize certain product lines 
we recognize costs associated with restructuring initiatives when incurred  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
for restructuring actions announced in  we expect to incur additional costs in and thereafter of approximately the purpose of our restructuring initiatives is to improve profitability  streamline operations  reduce costs and improve efficiency 
we believe that we will achieve operating cost reductions in and beyond through reduced employee and manufacturing costs and other facility overhead 
the estimated period in which we realize savings on our restructuring actions is on average approximately twelve months from the date of completion 
for restructuring actions announced in  we estimate that cost savings in the twelve months following the date of completion will be approximately estimated cost savings will be realized in cost of products sold and selling  general and administrative expenses 
these special charges can vary significantly from period to period and as a result  we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our special charges 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as part of our continual review of the recoverability of long lived assets  during the quarter ended september   we recorded a charge for the impairment of goodwill and an indefinite lived intangible asset related to our dock products business  a component of our industrial products and services segment 
our dock products business had incurred operating losses in the first nine months of of and  thus  had not been able to achieve its financial plan 
although the business is expected to return to profitability in and beyond  the projections of long term financial results indicated a potential impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
we considered a number of factors  including the input of an independent appraisal firm  in conducting the impairment testing of the dock products business 
we performed our impairment testing by first comparing the estimated fair value of the business to the carrying value of the reported net assets as of september  fair value was based on the income approach using a calculation of discounted cash flows from the most recent financial projections for the business 
based on this comparison  the net assets of the business had a carrying value that exceeded the related fair value 
the fair value of the business was then allocated among the related assets and liabilities of the business as a means of calculating the implied goodwill for the business 
as a result of this test  recorded goodwill was reduced by and the carrying value of tradenames was reduced by  resulting in a combined non cash impairment charge of during the quarter ended december   and as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing  we determined that the fair values of our fluid power and radiodetection businesses were less than the respective carrying values of their net assets 
during the preparation of our year end financial statements  we determined that the fair value of our tps business was less than the carrying value of its net assets 
as such  we recorded  during the fourth quarter of  in charges for the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets related to fluid power  radiodetection and tps 
similar to dock products  we considered a number of factors  including the input of an independent appraisal firm  in conducting the impairment testing of the fluid power  radiodetection  and tps businesses and used the same method for determining and allocating the fair value for each of these businesses 
as a result of our tests  goodwill recorded for these three businesses was reduced by and the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets was reduced by as a result of the impairment testing and related charges  the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of dock products  fluid power  radiodetection and tps businesses are equivalent to their estimated fair value 
therefore  unfavorable changes in the future financial results at these businesses could result in an additional impairment 
the remaining goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for dock products  fluid power  radiodetection  and tps were    and  respectively  at december  we will continue to monitor impairment indicators across our other businesses including  but not limited to  our waukesha electric systems and vance businesses  which had goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset balances of and  respectively  at december  stock based compensation we have a stock based compensation plan  including stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards 
we account for our stock based employee compensation under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  accordingly  except for restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards  we do not recognize any compensation expense 
in december  the fasb issued the revised sfas no 
 share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r supercedes apb no 
and requires the recognition of compensation expense over the vesting period for all share based payments  including stock options  based on the fair value of the instrument at the grant date 
sfas no 
r is effective starting with the first interim period beginning after june  we have not issued any stock options since our option grant and those will become fully vested in the first quarter of we intend to adopt the modified prospective application of expensing stock options in accordance with sfas no 
r 
accordingly  compensation expense will be recognized for these unvested stock options during the period july  through the first quarter of  with such amount totaling approximately  net of tax 
compensation expense will continue to be recognized for both outstanding unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units in accordance with apb no 
and eventually sfas no 
r  upon its adoption in third quarter of for the periods presented  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for the disclosure information required under sfas no 
restricted stock or restricted stock units may be granted to certain eligible employees in accordance with applicable equity compensation plan documents and agreements 
subject to participants continued employment and other plan terms and conditions  the restrictions lapse and units vest over three years 
the grants vest ratably 
in december  the compensation committee of the board of directors announced changes to our stock based employee compensation program 
under the announced changes  performance thresholds will be instituted for vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units in and future years 
for the nine member senior management group  this vesting will be based on spx shareholder return versus the s p composite index 
the share grant will vest if the company outperforms the s p index on an annual basis 
in the event the share grant does not vest in any year  the company s shareholder return versus the s p index for the cumulative periods will serve as the basis for vesting 
if the company s shareholder return does not exceed the s p index for any year in the cumulative period  then the recorded expense will be reversed 
for all other recipients  vesting will be based on the achievement of either economic value added eva performance targets or a substitute metric or the company s shareholder return versus the s p composite index 
upon vesting  the restricted stock units are converted into shares of our common stock and are free of any restrictions 
in  we issued shares of restricted stock and of restricted stock units to certain business leaders and other employees 
expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units is recognized over the vesting period in accordance with apb no 
compensation expense associated with restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards totaled in  net of a credit of relating to compensation expense previously recorded for restricted stock that was forfeited in connection with the december retirement and resignation of our then chairman  ceo and president 
the amount associated with the unvested portion of the restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is recorded  net of tax  as unearned compensation within shareholders equity  with such amount totaling at december  additionally  shares of restricted stock  including shares relating to the retirement of our then chairman  ceo  and president in december  and restricted stock units were forfeited during litigation and environmental matters numerous claims  complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including but not limited to those relating to environmental matters  competitive issues  contract issues  intellectual property matters  personal injury and product liability claims  and workers compensation have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
additionally  we may become subject to significant claims of which we are unaware currently or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate 
this may also be true in connection with past or future acquisitions 
while we maintain property  cargo  auto  product  general liability  and directors and officers liability insurance and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with our acquisitions that we believe cover a portion of these claims  this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
in addition  we have been increasing our self insurance limits over the past several years 
in addition  while we believe we are entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims  these rights may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
in our opinion  these matters are either without merit or are of a kind that should not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  we cannot assure you that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of these claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
it is our policy to comply fully with applicable environmental requirements 
we are currently involved in various investigatory and remedial actions at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites 
we accrue an estimate of loss  including expenses  from legal actions or claims when events exist that make the loss or expenses probable and we can reasonably estimate them 
our environmental accruals cover anticipated costs  including investigation  remediation  and operation and maintenance of clean up sites 
our estimates are based primarily on investigations and remediation plans established by independent consultants  potentially responsible third parties  and regulatory agencies at third party offsite disposal locations 
accordingly  our estimates may change based on future developments  including new or changes in existing environmental laws or policies  a difference in costs required to complete anticipated actions from estimates provided  future findings of investigation or remediation actions  or alteration to the expected remediation plans 
in determining our accruals  we do not discount environmental or other legal accruals and do not reduce them by anticipated insurance recoveries 
we do take into account third party indemnification from financially viable parties in determining our accruals where there is no dispute regarding the right to indemnification 
while we believe that our accruals related to environmental  litigation and other claims are sufficient and that these items and our rights to available insurance and indemnity will be resolved without material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity  individually or in the aggregate  we cannot assure you that will be the case 
financial instruments we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposures to fluctuating interest rate risk on our variable rate debt portfolio and foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposures to fluctuating currency exchange rates 
we use interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges to reduce the risk of fluctuating interest and currency rates  respectively  by fixing a known cash flow that will be expended or received at future dates 
from time to time  we enter into commodity contracts 
other than the above noted interest and foreign currency arrangements  there were no material derivative instrument transactions during any of the periods presented 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  however  such instruments may become speculative if the future cash flows originally hedged are no longer probable of occurring 
we report derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair value 
we record changes in the fair value of derivatives each period in earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction and on the type of hedge transaction 
we reclassify gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other comprehensive income to earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item  and we recognize the ineffective portion of hedges in earnings in the current period 
this can result in additional volatility in reported earnings  other comprehensive income and accumulated other comprehensive income 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  a qualifying derivative is designated as either a hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge  or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge 
we document our hedge relationships  including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction 
we record the fair values of derivative financial instruments in our balance sheet in other assets or other liabilities 
we also assess  both at inception and quarterly thereafter  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item 
we record the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments  which are designated as cash flow hedges  in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
ineffectiveness is recorded as a component of income 
changes in fair value are estimated by management quarterly based  in part  on dealer quotes 
income taxes we record our annual income taxes based on the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which includes an estimate of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities  including the results of local  state  federal or foreign statutory tax audits or estimates and judgments used 
during  we reduced our income tax provision by  and reduced goodwill by  associated with changes in estimates of income tax liabilities 
these changes in estimates resulted from the closure of certain matters with the irs relating to the to income tax returns of general signal corporation and spx corporation and the income tax return of udi 
general signal corporation was acquired through a reverse acquisition in  and udi was acquired in we reassess the adequacy of income tax liabilities at the end of each reporting period  including the results of local  state  federal and foreign statutory audits and estimates and judgments used 
as a result of the january divesture of bomag  we anticipate an increase in our effective income tax rate in as bomag has historically had a lower effective income tax rate in comparison to our remaining businesses 
realization of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration by tax jurisdiciton 
we believe that it is more likely than not that certain of these net operating loss and credit carryforwards may expire unused and  accordingly  have established a valuation allowance against them 
although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred tax assets  we believe it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings or alternative tax strategies 
however  deferred tax assets could be reduced in the near term if our estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period are significantly reduced or alternative tax strategies are no longer viable 
the valuation allowance decreased by and in and  respectively 
the amount of income tax that we pay annually is dependent on various factors  including the timing of certain deductions 
since these deductions can vary from year to year  the amount of income taxes paid in future years may be greater than amounts paid in  and as of december   deferred taxes of had been provided for the undistributed foreign earnings of certain subsidiaries 
with the exception of these subsidiaries  the remaining foreign earnings were considered indefinitely reinvested 
accordingly  as of december   no provision was recorded for us federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes other than the noted above 
during december  we repatriated capital and taxable earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of  with the taxable earnings totaling we provided taxes on these earnings of approximately in in october  the american jobs creation act of ajca was enacted 
ajca allows  among other things  us companies to repatriate up to of foreign earnings in at a federal effective tax rate of 
during  we intend to repatriate under the terms of the ajca and have provided for the estimated tax cost of the repatriation as of december  as noted above  deferred taxes had been provided previously for undistributed earnings of certain subsidiaries 
these taxes totaled approximately as of the end of the third quarter of and were established at tax rates that are higher than those that will apply under the ajca provisions 
we currently estimate that the tax cost for the repatriation will be approximately  including the tax cost on the repatriation of the earnings of certain subsidiaries that were not considered indefinitely reinvested 
accordingly  we have recorded a net tax benefit of approximately any remaining foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested 
accordingly  we have made no provision for us federal and state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes for these remaining foreign earnings 
if these earnings were distributed  we would be subject to us income taxes subject to a reduction for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries 
in  we  as part of a risk management initiative to effectively manage and reduce costs associated with certain liabilities  contributed assets and self insurance liabilities associated with existing retiree medical  workers compensation  and key manager life insurance programs to a fully consolidated risk management company rmc in exchange for stock representing a minority interest in the rmc 
subsequently  we sold the minority interest in the rmc to a third party investor at fair market value  which resulted in a capital loss of for tax purposes  calculated as the excess of the tax basis of the stock over the cash proceeds received on the sale of the stock 
in and  we entered into similar transactions designed to manage and reduce costs associated with certain healthcare and environmental liabilities 
those transactions resulted in tax losses of and  respectively 
in  the irs indicated that it intended to challenge the tax treatment of these types of transactions 
in  the irs issued a notice of proposed adjustment disallowing the capital loss claimed as a deduction on our tax return 
we protested the disallowance to the appeals office of the irs in june if the irs ultimately prevails in its positions  our income tax due for would increase by  plus net interest to date of approximately although the irs has not proposed adjustments for later years  we anticipate receiving notices for the and transactions 
the potential disallowance for these later years  computed on a similar basis to the disallowance  would be  plus net interest to date of approximately the irs has proposed penalties with respect to the transaction of because of several meritorious defenses  we believe the successful assertion of penalties is unlikely 
in addition  because we filed disclosure notices with the irs  we should not be subject to penalty assessments for the or transactions 
also in  the irs issued a notice of proposed adjustment with respect to the sale of sealed power europe in specifically  the irs is proposing to require recapture of certain foreign losses claimed as deductions on tax returns prior to if the irs ultimately prevails in its position  the income tax due for would increase by approximately  plus net interest to date of approximately we also protested this proposed adjustment to the appeals office of the irs in june if we are unable to resolve these matters with the appeals office of the irs  we would expect to receive a notice of tax deficiency from the irs 
upon receiving the notice  we would have the following options file a petition for redetermination in tax court within days 
in this case  payments would not be required until the tax court renders its decision 
wait to receive a statement of amount due from the irs and pay the amount due 
pay the amount due as outlined in option above  except  after paying the amount due  take appropriate steps to institute a suit in federal district court or the federal claims court for a refund of the amounts paid 
we believe that our positions are well supported and disagree with the proposed adjustments 
if we are unable to resolve this matter with the appeals office of the irs  we will make a decision as to which of the above three options we will pursue 
in any event  we intend to aggressively contest these matters through applicable irs and judicial procedures  as appropriate 
although the final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and involves unsettled areas of the law  based on currently available information  we have provided for our estimate of the probable liability associated with these matters 
liabilities established for the income taxes for the healthcare liability management company transaction and the sealed power europe transaction  as well as any interest for these transactions through  were established in connection with general signal corporation reverse acquisition in and  thus  recorded to goodwill 
any additional interest recorded for these matters has been provided through our statements of operations 
liabilities established for income taxes  as well as any interest  for the and healthcare liability management company transactions have been provided through our statements of operations as these transactions occurred after the general signal corporation reverse acquisition 
while the resolution of the issue may result in tax liabilities that may differ from the reserves established for this matter  we currently believe that the resolution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 
however  an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the quarter and year in which an adjustment is recorded or the tax is due or paid 
as we are no farther than the initial stages of the appeals process for any of the above matters  the timing of the ultimate resolution and any payments that may be required for the above matters cannot be determined at this time 
acquisitions we account for all business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  our statements of consolidated operations include the results of each acquired business since the date of acquisition 
we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at estimates of fair value  as determined by management based on information available 
management considers a number of factors  including third party valuations or appraisals  when making these determinations 
we finalize the allocation of purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed when we obtain information sufficient to complete the allocation  but in any case  within one year after acquisition 
as a result of acquisitions  we incur integration expenses for the incremental costs to exit and consolidate activities at the acquired companies locations  to terminate employees  and other costs of integrating operating locations and other activities of the acquired companies with our operations 
united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  require us to reflect these acquisition integration expenses  to the extent that they are not associated with the generation of future revenues and have no future economic benefit  as assumed liabilities in the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired 
on the other hand  these same principles require us to record acquisition integration expenses associated with integrating our existing operations into acquired company locations as period expenses 
these expenses are recorded as special charges and are discussed earlier in this section 
acquisition integration liabilities are based on our integration plans  which generally focus on three key areas of integration manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization  including plant closings  elimination of redundant administrative overhead and support activities  and restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies 
we expect that the termination of employees and consolidation of facilities will be substantially complete within one year of the date of acquisition 
other accounts the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on experience  current and expected future conditions 
we also consider information from third party evaluations with respect to certain assumptions used in establishing our estimates 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
listed below are the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
certain other estimates and assumptions are further explained elsewhere in this section or in previous sections 
the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate losses for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience and our evaluation of the likelihood of success in collecting specific customer receivables 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles subject to amortization we continually review whether events and circumstances subsequent to the acquisition of any long lived assets  or intangible assets subject to amortization  have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of those assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of those assets may not be recoverable 
if events and circumstances indicate that the long lived assets should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows on a non discounted basis related to the tested assets are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of those assets to determine if a write down is appropriate 
should impairment be identified  a loss is reported to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds their fair values as determined by valuation techniques appropriate in the circumstances that could include the use of similar cash flow projections on a discounted basis 
in determining the estimated useful lives of definite lived intangibles  we consider the nature  competitive position  life cycle position and historical and expected future operating cash flows of each acquired asset  as well as our commitment to support these assets through continued investment and legal infringement protection 
accrued liabilities we make estimates and judgments in establishing accruals as required under gaap  including the following legal it is our policy to accrue for estimated losses from legal actions or claims  including legal expenses  when events exist that make the realization of the losses or expenses probable and they can be reasonably estimated 
environmental remediation costs we expense costs incurred to investigate and remediate environmental issues unless they extend the economic useful life of related assets 
we record liabilities and report expenses when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
our environmental accruals cover anticipated costs  including investigation  remediation  and operation and maintenance of clean up sites 
our estimates are based primarily on investigations and remediation plans established by independent consultants  regulatory agencies and potentially responsible third parties 
we do not discount environmental obligations or reduce them by anticipated insurance recoveries 
self insurance we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability  and health costs  and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability 
our accrual for self insurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
management considers a number of factors  including third party actuarial valuations  when making these determinations 
we maintain third party stop loss insurance policies to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined amounts 
warranty in the normal course of business  we issue product warranties for specific product lines and provide for the estimated future warranty cost in the period in which the sale is recorded 
we provide for the estimate of warranty cost based on contract terms and historical warranty loss experience 
because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information  claims costs may differ from amounts provided 
in addition  due to the seasonal fluctuations at certain of our businesses  the timing of warranty provisions and the usage of warranty accruals can vary period to period 
we make adjustments to initial obligations for warranties as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable 
income taxes we perform reviews of our income tax positions on a continuous basis and accrue for potential contingencies when we believe a liability is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
reserves for these contingencies are recorded in income taxes payable and deferred and other income taxes in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on an expectation as to the timing of when the contingency will be resolved 
as events change or resolution occurs  these reserves are adjusted  such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities 
any potential liabilities in excess of amounts recorded are not material 
these reviews also entail analyzing the realization of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
when we believe that it is more likely than not that a net operating loss or credit carryforward may expire unused  we establish a valuation allowance against them

these repayments were applied to the term loans in direct order of maturity  as allowed under the amendment to the credit agreement dated december  see below for further discussion of this amendment 
although no amounts are borrowed under our revolving credit loans at december   any future borrowings under these loans would mature in  when the facility expires  but could be repaid at any time before on february   we refinanced our credit facility to reduce the applicable rate on our tranche b term loan 
we also amended certain covenants to  among other things  increase our flexibility associated with the mandatory repayment of debt and disposition of assets 
on december   we amended our credit facility to increase our flexibility to use proceeds from dispositions 
as a result  we are not required to prepay term loans or reinvest proceeds from the dispositions of bomag or est  in excess of the first required to be applied to prepay term loans 
the amendment also adds flexibility for the use of proceeds from the sale of additional assets 
in addition  the amendment provides that if the credit facilities are rated ba or lower by moody s or bb or lower by standard poors  the interest margin will generally increase by 
on march   standard poors adjusted the rating on our credit facility to bb  resulting in the margin increase on our credit facility 
lastly  the amendment modifies the formula relating to permitted stock buy backs  including permitting us to purchase unlimited amounts of our equity if our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda is less than to we are permitted to prepay the tranche a and tranche b term loans in whole or in part at any time without penalty or premium

the final maturity for each loan is as follows date of final maturity revolving credit loans march  tranche a term loans march  tranche b term loans september  our credit facility also requires scheduled principal payments of the term loans and issuances of subordinated debt under certain circumstances 
our revolving loans may be borrowed  prepaid and re borrowed 
letters of credit and swing line loans are also available under the revolving credit facility 
the facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit in us dollars  euros  and pounds sterling at any time during the revolving availability period  in an aggregate amount not exceeding letters of credit issued under this facility reduce the aggregate amount available under the revolving loan commitment 
under the credit facility  the term loans bear interest  at our option  at libor plus the applicable rate or the abr plus the applicable rate 
during  interest on the term loans generally was calculated using libor and we intend to select libor as the borrowing rate in the foreseeable future 
the applicable rate for the revolving loans and the tranche a and b term loans is based upon the consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility 
the applicable rate in effect after the december amendment and the rate adjustment by standard poors is as follows libor based borrowings abr based borrowings tranche a and b term loans and revolving loans between and between and our of revolving loans available under our credit facility is also subject to annual commitment fees between and on the unused portion of the loans 
as of december   the revolving credit loans were unused  however  the aggregate available borrowing capacity was reduced by of letters of credit outstanding as of december  our credit facility is secured by a pledge of of the stock of substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and of the stock in our foreign subsidiaries and a security interest in substantially all of our assets and all of the assets of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries 
our credit facility contains covenants  the most restrictive of which are two financial condition covenants 
the first financial condition covenant does not permit the consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility as of the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters to exceed to 
the second financial condition covenant does not permit the consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit facility for any period of four consecutive quarters to be less than to 
for the year ending december   our consolidated leverage ratio was to and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was to 
our credit facility also includes covenant provisions regarding  among other things  indebtedness  liens  investments  guarantees  acquisitions  dispositions  sales and leaseback transactions  restricted payments  and transactions with affiliates 
based on available information  we do not expect these covenants to restrict our liquidity  financial condition or access to capital resources in the foreseeable future 
under the credit facility covenants  our ability to pay cash dividends in a fiscal year is limited to plus an amount equal to of our consolidated net income as defined in the credit facility for the immediate preceding fiscal year minus stock repurchases in excess of if our consolidated leverage ratio is between and senior notes in june  we issued of non callable senior notes that mature on june  the interest payment dates for these notes are june and december of each year  which commenced on december  in december  we issued of callable senior notes that mature on january  the interest payment dates for these notes are january and july of each year  which commenced on july  both of these note issuances are unsecured and rank equally with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness  but are effectively junior to our senior secured debt and obligations of our subsidiaries 
during  we repurchased and of the senior notes and senior notes  respectively 
in connection with these repurchases  we recorded a charge of to interest expense relating to the write off of debt acquisition costs and the net premium associated with the repurchases of the notes 
the indentures governing the notes contain a number of covenants that limit our ability  and the ability of our subsidiaries  to incur additional debt  pay dividends and repurchase stock  make other restricted payments  including  without limitation  investments  create liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  including capital stock of subsidiaries  enter into transactions with our affiliates  and enter into mergers or consolidations 
as a result of the significant non cash impairment charges for goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  and other assets incurred during the fourth quarter of  we currently have of available capacity under the senior note indenture to make restricted payments  which includes paying cash dividends or repurchasing our stock 
as noted below  we have made an offer for the tender of the senior notes 
holders of more than the required of the senior notes have expressed a willingness to tender the notes and consent to the amendment of the senior note indentures  which will eliminate most of the covenants 
the closing of the tender offer is contingent on the closing of the sale of our est business  however  we could waive this closing condition and pay for the tendered notes with other funds  including the proceeds from the sale of our kendro business  if available 
under the indentures  none of our subsidiaries are restricted from paying dividends to us 
in february  we announced that we had commenced cash tender offers to purchase any and all of the outstanding senior notes and the senior notes collectively  the notes  as well as the related consent solicitations to amend the indenture governing each series of notes 
the total consideration to be paid for each validly tendered senior note will be based on a fixed spread of basis points over the yield to maturity of the us treasury note due february  the total consideration to be paid for each validly tendered senior note will be based on a fixed spread of basis points over the yield to maturity of the us treasury note due november  the foregoing amounts will include a consent payment of per  principal amount of the notes if the notes are tendered on or prior to consent time 
the consent solicitation and tender offers will expire on march   unless we extend them  and as of the date of this filing  a majority of each of the and senior notes had tendered into the offer  which would represent receipt of the requisite consents for each of the notes  upon closing of the offer 
in the event that we are successful in purchasing all of the notes  we will record charges of approximately for premium and fees paid to redeem the notes and for the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the notes 
liquid yield option notes on february   we issued liquid yield option tm notes february lyons at an original price of per  principal amount at maturity  which represents an aggregate initial issue price including the over allotment exercised by the original purchaser of and an aggregate principal amount of due at maturity on february  on may   we issued liquid yield option tm notes may lyons at an original price of per  principal amount at maturity  which represents an aggregate initial issue price including the over allotment exercised by the original purchaser of and an aggregate principal amount of due at maturity on may  we may redeem all or a portion of the february lyons for cash at any time on or after february  at predetermined redemption prices 
february lyons holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their lyons on february  for per lyon  or february  for per lyon 
we may redeem all or a portion of the may lyons for cash at any time on or after may  may lyons holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their lyons on may  for per lyon or may  for per lyon 
for either the february lyons or may lyons  we have the option to pay the purchase price in cash  shares of common stock or a combination of cash and common stock 
as of december   the february and may lyons had accreted carrying values of and  respectively  classified as long term debt 
sfas no 
classification of obligations that are callable by the creditor requires that obligations that are by their terms  due upon demand within one year of the balance sheet date be considered short term obligations  unless the obligor has the ability and the intent to refinance 
the may lyons have a put option date within twelve months of december  however  we have classified the full accreted value of the may lyons   as long term debt as we have the ability and intent at december   through the availability of our revolving loans  to refinance the full amount of any may lyons that may be put to us 
the next put date for the february lyons is february  and therefore all of the february lyons outstanding at december  are classified as long term debt 
in addition to using our revolving loans for the long term portion of the lyons  we may use cash or other capital market financing to fund the short term portion of these obligations if they are put to us or reach maturity 
the lyons have a yield to maturity of per year  computed on a semi annual bond equivalent basis  calculated from the date of issuance 
we will not pay cash interest on the lyons prior to maturity unless contingent interest becomes payable 
the lyons are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and are debt instruments subject to united states federal income tax contingent payment debt regulations 
even if we do not pay any cash interest on the lyons  holders of the lyons are required to include interest in their gross income for united states federal income tax purposes 
this imputed interest  also referred to as tax original issue discount  accrues at a rate equal to on the february lyons and on the may lyons 
the rate at which the tax original issue discount accrues for united states federal income tax purposes exceeds the stated yield of for the accrued original issue discount 
in the event that any of the february lyons or may lyons are put to the company or redeemed by the company  the respective imputed interest deduction less the original issue discount of would be recaptured at the time of the put or redemption 
the amount of tax recapture we may be subject to at the next put dates of may  and february   if the lyons are put to us  is and  respectively 
the lyons are subject to conversion to shares of our common stock only if certain contingencies are met 
these contingencies include our average stock price exceeding predetermined accreted values of our stock price each quarter see below  during any period in which the credit rating assigned to the lyons by either moody s or standard poor s is at or below a specified level  and upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions  including a change in control 
in addition  a holder may surrender for conversion  at the accreted value  a lyon for redemption even if it is not otherwise convertible at such time 
the conversion rights based on predetermined accretive values of our stock include  but are not limited to  the following provisions february lyons may lyons initial conversion rate shares of common stock per lyon initial accretion percentage accretion percentage decline per quarter conversion trigger prices for the next twelve months first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter holders may surrender lyons for conversion into shares of common stock in any calendar quarter  if  as of the last day of the preceding calendar quarter  the closing sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of such preceding calendar quarter is more than the specified percentage beginning at and declining per quarter thereafter for the february lyons  beginning at and declining per quarter thereafter for the may lyons of the accreted conversion price per share of common stock on the last trading day of such preceding calendar quarter 
the accreted conversion price per share as of any day will equal the issue price of a lyon plus the accrued original issue discount to that day  divided by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of a lyon on that day 
in october  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share 
under the eitf s conclusion  instruments that are convertible to common stock based on achieving a market price trigger are to be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share regardless of whether the contingency has been met 
the effective date for the eitf is for reporting periods ending after december  and required retroactive restatement of our diluted earnings per share calculations for all periods presented 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the calculations of diluted earnings per share 
other borrowings certain of our businesses participate in extended accounts payable programs through agreements with certain lending institutions 
under the arrangements  the businesses are provided extended payment terms 
as of december   the participating businesses had outstanding under these arrangements 
additionally  certain of our businesses purchase goods and services under a purchasing card program allowing payment beyond their normal payment terms 
as of december   the participating businesses had outstanding under this arrangement 
as these arrangements extend the payment of our businesses payables beyond their normal payment terms  we have classified these amounts as short term debt 
at december   a total of was outstanding under these programs 
other financing activities in first nine months of  we entered into sale and assignment transactions whereby certain of our businesses sold without recourse certain accounts receivable 
at the beginning of the fourth quarter of  we discontinued the sale of accounts receivable 
net proceeds from similar non recourse accounts receivable sales were at december  once sold  these receivables are not included on our balance sheet 
in april  we entered into a three year trade receivables financing agreement whereby we can borrow  on a continuous basis  up to availability of funds may fluctuate over time given changes in eligible receivable balances  but will not exceed the program limit 
the facility contains representations  warranties  covenants  and indemnities customary for facilities of this type 
the facility does not contain any covenants that we view as materially constraining to the activities of our business 
during the third quarter of  we borrowed million under the financing agreement  with such balance included in short term debt at december  prior to the third quarter of  there were no borrowings under the financing agreement 
financial instruments we have entered into interest rate protection agreements swaps to hedge the potential impact of increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt portfolio 
we account for our swaps as cash flow hedges  and as of december   we had outstanding swaps with maturities to november that effectively convert  of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate of approximately 
as of december   the pre tax accumulated derivative loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income was  and we have recorded a long term liability of to recognize the fair value of these swaps 
based on the unrealized losses of our swaps at december   we expect to reclassify of our current derivative loss from accumulated other comprehensive income into interest expense during as the hedged transactions occur 
due to fluctuations in interest rates  however  the derivative loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income is subject to change prior to its reclassification into earnings 
the ineffective portion of these swaps has been recognized in earnings as a component of interest and resulted in income of in and expense in of in connection with the january  repayment of of our tranche a and b term loans  we terminated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of for cash of in  in connection with the repayment of of our outstanding tranche b term loan  we terminated one interest rate swap with an aggregate notional amount of for cash of these instruments were included in the portfolio of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of our variable rate debt portfolio 
because the future interest payments hedged by swaps with a notional amount of and at december  and  respectively  were no longer probable of occurring  in and we recognized and  respectively  in interest expense to reclassify into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income  the fair value of the related swaps 
we manufacture and sell our products in a number of countries and  as a result  are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as such  we have entered into foreign currency protection agreements fx contracts to hedge the potential impact of the change in the us dollar versus certain foreign currencies eg  the euro  pounds sterling  and canadian dollar 
we account for our fx contracts as cash flow hedges  and as of december   we had outstanding fx contracts with maturities of generally no more than months and an aggregate notional amount of as of december   the pre tax accumulated gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income was  and we have recorded current assets of to recognize the fair value of these fx contracts 
we expect to reclassify of our current fx contract gains from accumulated other comprehensive income into revenues or cost of goods sold during as the hedged transactions occur 
due to the fluctuations in currency exchange rates  however  the gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income is subject to change prior to reclassification to earnings 
the ineffective portion of the fx contract portfolio has been recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense  net  and resulted in income in of the amounts of fx contracts were not material to our consolidated financial statements prior to from time to time we enter into commodity contracts 
other than the above noted swap and foreign currency arrangements  there were no material derivative instrument transactions during any of the periods presented 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  however  such instruments may become speculative if the future cash flows originally hedged are no longer probable of occurring 
current liquidity and principal payments with the closing of the bomag transaction  as well as the anticipated closing of the est and kendro transactions in the first and second quarters of  respectively  we expect to have significant available liquidity to allow us the flexibility to revise our capital structure  invest in technology and our businesses  and make acquisitions 
specifically  we expect to generate net proceeds from these three transactions of approximately  we intend to use these proceeds  along with cash generated from operations  to pay down debt and repurchase equity in we use operating leases to finance certain asset purchases when economically supported by our internal evaluation model 
at december   we had of future minimum rental payments under leases with remaining non cancelable terms in excess of one year 
at december   we had of cash available for use and an unused revolver under our credit facility 
when adjusted by the of letters of credit outstanding at december   of the revolver was available for immediate use 
we believe that current cash and equivalents  cash flows from the pending divestitures  cash flows from operations and our unused revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  other operational cash requirements  and required debt service obligations 
in addition  we believe we have the ability and may elect to refinance the lyons  if put  with other debt 
we have a shelf registration statement for shares of common stock that may be issued for acquisitions 
we also have a  shelf registration that may be used in connection with an offering of certain debt and or equity securities for general corporate purposes or for the refinancing of existing debt 
in addition  other financing instruments may be used from time to time  including  but not limited to  private placement instruments  operating leases  capital leases and securitizations 
we expect that we will continue to access these markets as appropriate to maintain liquidity and to provide sources of funds for general corporate purposes or to refinance existing debt 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants included in our capital financing instruments 
in  our board of directors approved the implementation of a quarterly dividend program 
the actual amount of each quarterly dividend  as well as each declaration date  record date and payment date is subject to the discretion of the board of directors  and the target dividend level may be adjusted during the year at the discretion of the board of directors 
the factors the board of directors considers in determining the actual amount of each quarterly dividend include our financial performance and on going capital needs  our ability to declare and pay dividends under the terms of our credit facility and indenture  and other factors deemed relevant 
during  we declared and paid dividends of and  respectively 
as a result of the significant non cash impairment charges for goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  and other assets incurred during the fourth quarter of  we currently have of available capacity under the senior note indenture to make restricted payments  which includes paying cash dividends or repurchasing our stock 
we have made an offer for the tender of the senior notes 
holders of more than the required of the senior notes have expressed a willingness to tender the notes and consent to the amendment of the senior note indentures  which will eliminate most of the covenants 
the closing of the tender offer is contingent on the closing of the sale of our est business  however  we could waive this closing condition and pay for the tendered notes with other funds  including the proceeds from the sale of our kendro business  if available 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments  trade accounts receivable  and interest rate and foreign currency protection agreements 
cash and temporary investments and our interest rate and foreign currency protection agreements are placed with high quality financial institutions throughout the world 
we periodically evaluate the credit standing of these financial institutions 
concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are due to selling to a large number of customers in a particular industry 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and obtain collateral or other security when appropriate 
no one customer accounts for more than of our revenues 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to our interest rate and foreign currency protection agreements  but have no other off balance sheet credit risk of accounting loss 
we anticipate  however  that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
we do not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk  but we do monitor the credit standing of counter parties 
on a net basis  including both continuing and discontinued operations  we paid  and in cash taxes for  and  respectively 
in  we made payments of associated with the actual and estimated tax liability for federal  state and foreign tax obligations and received refunds of the amount of income tax that we pay annually is dependent on various factors  including the timing of certain deductions 
since these deductions can vary from year to year  the amount of income taxes paid in future years may be greater than amounts paid in  and as of december   except as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements and for the following items  we do not have any material guarantees  off balance sheet arrangements or purchase commitments other than of certain standby letters of credit outstanding  of which reduce the available borrowing capacity on our revolving loans  and approximately of surety bonds 
of the total letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding at december   were for bid  performance or warranty arrangements related to commercial sales arrangements with customers of which the fees are reimbursed by the customer 
in addition  of our standby letters of credit relate to self insurance matters and originate from workers compensation  auto  or general liability claims made against us 
we account for each of these claims as part of our self insurance accruals 
except for the previously mentioned matters  we do not have any other material guarantees  off balance sheet arrangements or purchase commitments 
our certificate of incorporation provides that we shall indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by the delaware general corporation law for any personal liability in connection with their employment or service with us  subject to limited exceptions 
while we maintain insurance for this type of liability  the liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 
we continually review each of our businesses in order to determine their long term strategic fit 
these reviews could result in selected acquisitions to expand an existing business or result in the disposition of an existing business 
additionally  we have stated that we may consider a larger acquisition  more than  in revenues  if certain criteria were met 
there can be no assurances that these acquisitions will not have an impact on our capital financing requirements  will be integrated successfully  or that they may not have a negative effect on our operations

effective for all periods ending after december  and accordingly we have reflected the impact of eitf no 
on our diluted income per share for all periods presented herein 
the adoption of eitf resulted in the restatement of diluted earnings per share for and for the inclusion of the contingent convertible common shares associated with our lyons 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
sfas no 
amends the previous guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  and its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued the revised sfas no 
 share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r supercedes apb no 
and requires the recognition of compensation expense over the vesting period for all share based payments  including stock options  based on the fair value of the instrument at the grant date 
sfas no 
r is effective starting with the first interim period beginning after june  we have not issued any stock options since our option grant and those will become fully vested in the first quarter of we intend to adopt the modified prospective application of expensing stock options in accordance with sfas no 
r 
accordingly  compensation expense will be recognized for these unvested stock options during the period july  through the first quarter of  with such amount totaling approximately  net of tax 
compensation expense will continue to be recognized for both outstanding unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units in accordance with apb no 
and eventually sfas no 
r  upon its adoption in the third quarter of for the periods presented  we have provided the disclosure provisions of sfas no

factors that may affect future results our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 
at december   we had approximately  in total indebtedness 
on that same date  we had of available borrowing capacity under our revolving senior credit facility after giving effect to reserved for letters of credit outstanding  which reduce the availability under our revolving senior credit facility 
in addition  at december   our cash balance was see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a and note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
subject to certain restrictions set forth in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future  including indebtedness incurred to finance  or which is assumed in connection with  acquisitions 
we may in the future renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facility with agreements that have different or more stringent terms or split our senior credit facility into two or more facilities with different terms 
the level of our indebtedness could limit cash flow available for general corporate purposes  such as acquisitions and capital expenditures  due to the ongoing cash flow requirements for debt service  limit our ability to obtain  or obtain on favorable terms  additional debt financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions  limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions generally  expose us to a risk that a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business could make it difficult to meet debt service requirements  and expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because the existing borrowings are  and any new borrowings may be at variable rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on  or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations  including our obligations to repurchase the lyons if the holders of the lyons require us to repurchase their securities beginning in february for the february lyons will depend upon our future operating performance  which may be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  such as the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and initiatives taken by our competitors 
in addition  there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness 
if we are unable to service our indebtedness  whether in the ordinary course of business or upon acceleration of such indebtedness  we may be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital expenditures  revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital 
if we are required to take any of these actions  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions  that these actions would enable us continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements 
we may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facility  the indenture governing our senior notes and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness 
our senior credit facility  the indentures governing our senior notes and other agreements governing our other indebtedness contain  or may contain  a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied 
as a result of the significant non cash impairment charges for goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  and other assets incurred during the fourth quarter of  we currently have of available capacity under the senior note indenture to make restricted payments  which includes paying cash dividends or repurchasing our stock 
we have made an offer for the tender of the senior notes 
holders of more than the required of the senior notes have expressed a willingness to tender the notes and consent to the amendment of the senior note indentures  which will eliminate most of the covenants 
the closing of the tender offer is contingent on the closing of the sale of our est business  however  we could waive this closing condition and pay for the tendered notes with other funds  including the proceeds from the sale of our kendro business  if available 
we also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests 
in some cases  our subsidiaries may be subject to similar restrictions that may restrict their ability to make distributions to us 
in addition  our senior credit facility  the indentures governing our senior notes and these other agreements contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants as described under md a 
all of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities  such as acquisitions  as they arise 
if we do not comply with these or other covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facility  the indentures governing our senior notes and other agreements governing our indebtedness  we could be in default under those agreements  and the debt  together with accrued interest  could then be declared immediately due and payable 
if we default under our senior credit facility  the lenders could cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facility to become due and payable  require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness or prevent us from making debt service payments on any subordinated indebtedness we owe 
if our debt is accelerated  we may not be able to repay our debt or refinance it 
even if we are able to obtain new financing  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
in addition  any default under our senior credit facility or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
if the indebtedness under our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes is accelerated  we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facility  our senior notes  or the lyons that we have issued  or under other debt securities then outstanding 
our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facility  the indentures governing our senior notes and other agreements governing our other indebtedness may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
in addition  complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 
our failure to successfully integrate recent acquisitions  as well as any future acquisitions  could have a negative effect on our operations  our acquisitions could cause unexpected financial difficulties 
as part of our business strategy  we evaluate potential acquisitions in the ordinary course  some of which could be material 
we made six acquisitions in for an aggregate purchase price of  net of cash acquired and inclusive of debt assumed of  which excludes consideration held back by us that may be paid in future periods 
our acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including adverse effects on our reported operating results due to charges to earnings  including impairment charges associated with goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  diversion of management attention from running our existing businesses  difficulty with integration of personnel and financial and other systems  increased expenses  including compensation expenses resulting from newly hired employees  increased foreign operations that may be difficult to assimilate  assumption of known and unknown liabilities and increased litigation  and potential disputes with the sellers of acquired businesses  technology  services or products 
we may not be able to successfully integrate the technology  operations and personnel of any acquired business 
our integration activities may place substantial demand on our management  operational resources and financial and internal control systems 
customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business  technology  service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 
in addition  any acquired business  technology  service or product could under perform relative to our expectations 
we also could experience financial or other setbacks if any of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future have problems or liabilities of which we are not aware or that are substantially greater than we anticipate 
in addition  as a result of future acquisitions  we may further increase our debt level  or if we issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions  significantly dilute our existing shareholders 
our failure to successfully complete pending dispositions  as well as any future dispositions  could have a negative effect on our cash flows and or our ability to execute our financial strategy 
we continually review each of our businesses in order to determine their long term strategic fit 
as part of this financial strategy  we evaluate potential dispositions in the ordinary course  some of which could be material 
our currently pending dispositions  including the sale of our est and kendro businesses  as well as any future dispositions  involve a number of risks and present financial  managerial and operational challenges 
over the past few months  we have divested our bomag business and entered into agreements to divest our est and kendro businesses 
we expect to generate aggregate net proceeds of approximately  from these divestitures and intend to use these proceeds to pay down debt and repurchase equity 
however  these divestitures are subject to a number of customary closing conditions 
the sale of our kendro business is also subject to foreign regulatory approvals 
the tender offer for our senior notes due and our senior notes due is conditioned on the completion of the sale of our est business 
if we do not complete this sale  our senior notes and senior notes may remain outstanding and we will remain subject to the covenants of the indentures related to these notes 
we have made an offer for the tender of the senior notes 
holders of more than the required of the senior notes have expressed a willingness to tender the notes and consent to the amendment of the senior note indentures which will eliminate most of the covenants 
the closing of the tender offer is contingent on the closing of the sale of our est business  however  we could waive this closing condition and pay for the tendered notes with other funds  including the proceeds from the sale of our kendro business  if available 
if these divestitures  or any future dispositions are not completed in a timely manner  there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and or our ability to execute our strategy 
we may not achieve the expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisitions 
as a result of our acquisitions  we incur integration expenses for the incremental costs to exit and consolidate activities  to terminate employees  and for other costs to integrate operating locations and other activities of acquired companies with our operations 
significant portions of these expenses are cash expenses 
generally accepted accounting principles require that these acquisition integration expenses  which are not associated with the generation of future revenues and have no future economic benefit  be reflected as assumed liabilities in the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired 
on the other hand  these same principles require that acquisition integration expenses associated with integrating our operations into locations of the acquired company must be recorded as expense 
accordingly  these expenses are not included in the allocation of the purchase price of the company acquired 
over the past five years  we have recorded special charges to our results of operations associated with cost reductions  integrating acquisitions and achieving operating efficiencies 
we believe that our actions have been required to improve our operations and  as described above  we will  if necessary  record future charges  which may be material  as appropriate to address cost and operational inefficiencies 
our plan is to achieve cost savings associated with integrating our acquisitions 
this plan is sometimes a consideration in the price we are willing to pay for acquisitions 
our current integration strategy for acquisitions focuses on three key areas of cost savings manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization  including plant closings  elimination of redundant administrative overhead and support activities  and restructuring and repositioning sales and marketing organizations to eliminate redundancies 
while we anticipate that we will achieve cost savings associated with integrating our acquisitions  cost savings expectations are inherently estimates that are difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature 
in addition  we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings or other benefits from our acquisitions 
as a result  our actual cost savings  if any  and other anticipated benefits could significantly differ or be delayed  compared to our estimates and the other information contained in this report 
we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate  which could negatively impact us 
we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at similar rates to our past acquisition rates  which could materially impact our growth rate  results of operations  cash flows and stock price 
our ability to continue to achieve our goals may depend upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire companies  businesses and product lines  to effectively integrate them and to achieve cost effectiveness 
we also may need to raise additional funds to consummate these acquisitions 
in addition  changes in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions 
competition for acquisitions in our business areas could also result in higher prices for these businesses  which may also impact our acquisition rate or the success rate of our acquisitions 
the loss of key personnel and any inability to attract and retain qualified employees could materially adversely impact our operations 
we are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team 
the loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect 
additionally  we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in order to operate our business successfully 
from time to time  there may be a shortage of skilled labor  which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees 
if we were unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly  our operations would be materially adversely affected 
many of the industries in which we operate are cyclical  and  accordingly  our business is subject to changes in the economy  pressure from original equipment manufacturers to reduce costs could adversely affect our business 
many of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles 
certain businesses are subject to industry cycles  including  but not limited to the automotive industry  which influences our service solutions and industrial products and services segments  the electric power and infrastructure markets  which influence our industrial products and services and cooling technologies and services segments  process equipment  chemical and petrochemical markets  which influence our flow technology segment  and the non residential facility construction markets  which influence our industrial products and services segments 
demand for products in our cooling technologies and services segment is highly correlated to contract timing on large construction contracts  which may cause significant fluctuations from period to period 
accordingly  any downturn or competitive pricing pressures in those or other markets in which we participate could adversely affect us 
difficulties at enron  dynegy  nrg and other independent power producers has led to a change in the buying habits of some customers in the power generation markets  which has led to lower demand and price levels for our power transformers 
a decline in automotive sales and production may not only affect our sales of components  tools and services to vehicle manufacturers and their dealerships  but also sales of components  tools and services to aftermarket customers  and could result in a decline in our results of operations or a deterioration in our financial condition 
similar cyclical changes could also affect aftermarket sales of products in our other segments 
there is also substantial and continuing pressure from the major oems  particularly in the automotive industry  to reduce costs  including the cost of products and services purchased from outside suppliers such as us 
if in the future we were unable to generate sufficient cost savings to offset price reductions  our gross margins could be materially adversely affected 
if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter or period 
the downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at the same time  which could exacerbate any material adverse effects to our business 
see md a business segment information 
in addition  certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year 
certain of our businesses have been impacted in by difficult economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the economy will not worsen or that we will be able to sustain existing or create additional cost reductions to offset economic conditions  and the unpredictability and changes in the industrial markets in the current environment could continue and may adversely impact our results 
cost reduction actions often result in charges against earnings 
we expect to take charges against earnings in in connection with implementing additional cost reduction actions at certain of our businesses 
these charges can vary significantly from period to period and  as a result  we may experience fluctuations in our reported net income and earnings per share due to the timing of restructuring actions  which in turn can cause fluctuations in our stock price 
if the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles of the respective reporting unit  a material non cash charge to earnings could result 
at december   we had net goodwill and intangible assets of approximately  and shareholders equity of approximately  we account for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
states that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded a non cash impairment charge of during as a policy  we conduct annual impairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
in addition  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
if the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  we may be required to write off a portion of the balance 
consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 the fair values of our reporting units were based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units 
other considerations are also incorporated  including comparable industry price multiples 
many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve 
accordingly  we consider estimates and judgments that affect the future cash flow projections including principal methods of competition such as volume  price  service  product performance and technical innovations as well as estimates associated with cost improvement initiatives  capacity utilization  and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes 
accordingly  we monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses 
any significant change in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicates a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairment in the period that the change becomes known 
as part of our continual review of the recoverability of long lived assets  during the quarter ended september   we recorded a charge for the impairment of goodwill and an indefinite lived intangible asset related to our dock products business  a component of our industrial products and services segment 
our dock products business had incurred operating losses in the first nine months of of and  thus  had not been able to achieve its financial plan 
although the business is expected to return to profitability in and beyond  the projections of long term financial results indicated a potential impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
we considered a number of factors  including the input of an independent appraisal firm  in conducting the impairment testing of the dock products business 
we performed our impairment testing by first comparing the estimated fair value of the business to the carrying value of the reported net assets as of september  fair value was based on the income approach using a calculation of discounted cash flows from the most recent financial projections for the business 
based on this comparison  the net assets of the business had a carrying value that exceeded the related fair value 
the fair value of the business was then allocated among the related assets and liabilities of the business as a means of calculating the implied goodwill for the business 
as a result of this test  recorded goodwill was reduced by and the carrying value of tradenames was reduced by  resulting in a combined non cash impairment charge of during the quarter ended december   and as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing  we determined that the fair values of our fluid power and radiodetection businesses were less than the respective carrying values of their net assets 
during the preparation of our year end financial statements  we determined that the fair value of our tps business was less than the carrying value of its net assets 
as such  we recorded  during the fourth quarter of  in charges for the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets related to fluid power  radiodetection and tps 
similar to dock products  we considered a number of factors  including the input of an independent appraisal firm  in conducting the impairment testing of the fluid power  radiodetection  and tps businesses and used the same method for determining and allocating the fair value for each of these businesses 
as a result of our tests  goodwill recorded for these three businesses was reduced by and the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets was reduced by as a result of the impairment testing and related charges  the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of dock products  fluid power  radiodetection  and tps businesses are equivalent to their estimated fair value 
unfavorable changes in the future financial results of these businesses could result in additional impairment 
the remaining goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for dock products  fluid power  radiodetection  and tps were    and  respectively  at december  we will continue to monitor impairment indicators across our other businesses  including  but not limited to  our waukesha electric systems and vance businesses  which had goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset balances of and  respectively  at december  our strategy to outsource more of the various elements of the products we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers  which could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
our increasing dependence on third party suppliers for outsourced products or components subjects us to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products we sell because of supplier failure 
in addition  business difficulties experienced by a third party supplier can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain the outsourced product and ultimately our inability to supply products to our customers 
third party supplier business interruptions can include  but are not limited to  work stoppages  union negotiations and other labor disputes  as well as financial and credit difficulties 
a portion of our revenues is generated through long term fixed price contracts  which could expose us to various risks including the risks of cost overruns  inflation and credit risks associated with certain customers 
a portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through long term fixed price contracts 
we recognize revenues from certain of these contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting whereby revenue and expenses  and thereby profit  in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs remaining to complete a particular project 
to the extent that we under estimate the remaining cost to complete a project  we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period 
further  certain of these contracts and our other contracts provide for penalties for failure to timely perform our obligations under a contract  or require that we  at our expense  correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other party  certain defects 
we may enter into additional long term fixed price contracts of this type or other performance obligations in the future and there is no assurance that expenses relating to these provisions will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we are subject to environmental and similar laws and potential liability relating to certain claims  complaints and proceedings  including those relating to environmental and other matters  arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are subject to various environmental laws  ordinances  regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations 
these requirements may include  for example  those governing discharges from and materials handled as part of our operations  the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or wastes  and the health and safety of our employees 
under certain of these laws  ordinances or regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or petroleum products on  under  or in its property  without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or caused  the presence of the contaminants  and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they occurred 
the presence of  or failure to remediate properly  these substances may have adverse effects  including  for example  substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent that property or to borrow funds using that property as collateral 
under certain of these laws  ordinances or regulations  a party that disposes of hazardous substances or wastes at a third party disposal facility may also become a responsible party required to share in the costs of site investigation and environmental remediation 
in connection with our acquisitions and divestitures  we may assume or retain significant environmental liabilities 
although we perform extensive due diligence with respect to acquisitions  divestitures and continuing operations  we may have environmental liabilities of which we are not aware 
future developments related to new or existing environmental matters or changes in environmental laws or policies could lead to material costs for environmental compliance or cleanup 
there can be no assurance that these liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position in the future 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
numerous claims  complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including but not limited to those relating to environmental matters  competitive issues  contract issues  intellectual property matters  personal injury and product liability claims  and workers compensation have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
additionally  we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate 
this may also be true in connection with past or future acquisitions 
while we maintain property  cargo  auto  product  general liability  and directors and officers liability insurance and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with these acquisitions that we believe cover a portion of these claims  this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
in addition  we have been increasing our self insurance limits over the past several years 
while we believe we are entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims  these rights may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures 
in our opinion  these matters are either without merit or are of a kind that should not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  we cannot assure you that recoveries from insurance or indemnification claims will be available or that any of these claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see md a accounting policies and used of estimates litigation and environmental matters 
it is our policy to comply fully with applicable environmental requirements 
we are currently involved in various investigatory and remedial actions at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites 
we accrue an estimate of loss  including expenses  from legal actions or claims when events exist that make the loss or expenses probable and we can reasonably estimate them 
our environmental accruals cover anticipated costs  including investigation  remediation  and operation and maintenance of clean up sites 
our estimates are based primarily on investigations and remediation plans developed by independent consultants  regulatory agencies and potentially responsible third parties 
accordingly  our estimates may change based on future developments  including new or changes in existing environmental laws or policies  a difference in costs required to complete anticipated actions from estimates provided  future findings of investigation or remediation actions  or alteration to the expected remediation plans 
it is our policy to realize a change in estimates once it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in determining our accruals  we do not discount environmental or other legal accruals and do not reduce them by anticipated insurance recoveries 
we do take into account third party indemnification from financially viable parties in determining our accruals where there is no dispute regarding the right to indemnification 
while we believe that our accruals related to environmental  litigation and other claims are sufficient and that these items and our rights to available insurance and indemnity will be resolved without material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity  individually or in the aggregate  we cannot assure you that our accruals and right to indemnity and insurance will be sufficient or that these items will be resolved without a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity  individually or in the aggregate 
we are subject to work stoppages  union negotiations  labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force  which may adversely impact our profitability and cause us to incur incremental costs 
as of december   we had approximately  employees  which included  employees relating to businesses classified in our financial statements as discontinued operations 
eighteen domestic collective bargaining units and various foreign collective labor arrangements cover approximately  employees  which included  employees relating to businesses classified in our financial statements as discontinued operations 
over the past year  we have been involved in collective bargaining agreement negotiations with a union covering approximately employees at our waukesha electric systems facility in waukesha  wi 
although we are attempting to finalize these negotiations  we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate this agreement without production interruptions caused by work stoppages 
while we generally have experienced satisfactory relations at our various locations  we are subject to potential union campaigns  work stoppages  union negotiations and potential labor disputes 
further  we may be subject to work stoppages  which are beyond our control  at our suppliers or customers 
difficulties presented by international economic  political  legal  accounting and business factors could negatively affect our interests and business effort 
in  approximately of our sales were international 
sales originating from business units in germany and the united kingdom in were and  respectively 
we continue to increase our sales outside the united states  with an emphasis on expanding our presence in china 
our international operations require us to comply with the legal requirements of foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions 
our foreign business operations also are subject to the following risks difficulty in managing  operating and marketing our international operations because of distance  as well as language and cultural differences  increased strength of the us dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in us dollars  which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices and also decrease our reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices  likewise  decreased strength of the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas  difficulty entering new international markets due to greater regulatory barriers than the united states and differing political systems  increased costs due to domestic and foreign customs and tariffs  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and transportation and shipping expenses  credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors  potential difficulties in staffing and labor disputes  risk of nationalization of private enterprises  government embargos or foreign trade restrictions such as anti dumping duties  increased costs of transportation or shipping  environmental laws and regulations  ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally during times of crisis or otherwise  potential difficulties in protecting intellectual property  increased worldwide hostilities including  but not limited to  military action in iraq  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  and local political  economic and social conditions  including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability in certain countries 
as we continue to expand our international operations  these and other risks associated with international operations are likely to increase 
in addition  as we enter new geographic markets  we may encounter significant competition from the primary participants in those markets who may have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do 
future increases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
if certain conditions are met  the lyons could be converted into shares of our common stock 
the shares that are covered by the february lyons and the may lyons have been registered under the securities act 
subject to adjustment  the lyons could be converted into an aggregate of shares of common stock 
in addition  as of december   approximately shares of our common stock are issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options by employees and non employee directors and we have the ability to issue up to an additional shares as restricted stock  restricted stock units  or stock options under our stock compensation plan 
additionally  we may issue a significant number of additional shares in connection with our acquisitions 
we also have a shelf registration statement for shares of common stock that may be issued in acquisitions  and we have a shelf registration statement for a total of  which may be used in connection with an offering of debt securities  preferred securities and or common stock for general corporate purposes 
any additional shares issued could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share 
provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company  and  accordingly  we may not consummate a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may inhibit changes in our control not approved by our board 
these provisions include  for example a staggered board of directors  a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent  a requirement that special shareholder meetings be called only by our chairman  president or our board  advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations  limitations on shareholders ability to amend  alter or repeal the by laws  enhanced voting requirements for certain business combinations involving substantial shareholders  the authority of our board to issue  without shareholder approval  preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion  and limitations on shareholders ability to remove directors 
we also have a shareholder rights plan designed to make it more costly and thus more difficult to gain control of us without the consent of our board 
in addition  we are afforded the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have similar effects 
in general  section prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder each as defined in section for at least three years after the time the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met 
our technology is important to our success 
because many of our products rely on proprietary technology  we believe that the development and protection of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business 
in order to maintain our market positions and margins  we need to continually develop and introduce high quality  technologically advanced and cost effective products on a timely basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all amounts are in millions we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  and we selectively use financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  however  such instruments may become speculative if the future cash flows originally hedged are no longer probable of occurring 
we have interest rate protection agreements with financial institutions to limit exposure to interest rate volatility 
our currency exposures vary  but are primarily concentrated in the euro  canadian dollar  and british pound

expected maturity date after total fair value long term debt senior notes average interest rate senior notes average interest rate lyons  fully accreted  average interest rate term loans  average interest rate there are various factors that a lyon holder would use in deciding to exercise its put option 
these factors include the price and volatility of our common stock  the interest yield on the lyons above the risk free interest rate and other quantitative and qualitative factors
