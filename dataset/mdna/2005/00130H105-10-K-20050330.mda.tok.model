item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity for more detail 
if environmental and land use regulations change in the future  we may be required to make significant capital or other expenditures 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover from our customers some or all costs to comply with such environmental or land use regulations or that our business  financial conditions or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected 
various licenses  permits and approvals are required for our operations 
failure to comply with permits or approvals  or with environmental laws  can result in fines  penalties  or interruptions to our operations 
while we have at times been out of compliance with environmental laws and regulations  past non compliance has not resulted in the revocation of material permits or licenses  and has not had a material impact on our operations or results 
air emissions 
the us clean air act and various state laws and regulations regulate emissions of major air pollutants  including sulfur dioxide so  nitrogen oxides so and particulate matter pm in the us the environmental protection agency s epa us state implementation plan nox sip call required operators of coal fired electric generating facilities in us states and the district of columbia either i to reduce their nox emissions to levels allocated under the plan or ii to purchase nox emissions allowances from other operators in order to meet allocated emissions levels by may  we are in the process or have completed installing selective catalytic reduction scr and other nox control technologies at three facilities of our subsidiary  indianapolis power and light ipl in response to nox sip call implementation and other proposed air emissions regulations that are discussed in more detail below 
in march  the epa finalized two rules that will affect many of our us coal fired power generating plants 
the first rule  named the clean air interstate rule cair  was issued on march  and requires significant reductions of so and so emissions from existing power plants located in eastern states and the district of columbia 
the required emission reductions will be in two phases with the first phase beginning in and for nox and nox  respectively  and a second phase with increased required reductions in both air pollutant emissions beginning in the second rule  called the clean air mercury rule  was issued on march  and requires reductions of mercury emissions from coal fired power plants 
this rule requires mercury emission reductions from most us coal fired power plants in two phases 
the first phase will begin in and will require nationwide reduction of coal fired power plant mercury emissions from to tons per year 
the second phase will begin in and will require nationwide reduction of mercury emissions from these sources from tons per year to tons per year 
the clean air mercury rule also establishes stringent mercury emission performance standards for new coal fired power plants 
for these two new rules  the states will be establishing emission allowance based nox  nox and mercury emission cap and trade programs to implement the required emission reductions 
while the exact impact and cost of these two new rules cannot be established until the states complete assigning emission allowances to our affected facilities  there can be no assurance that our business  financial conditions or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by these new rules 
ipl has made and will incur substantial environmental capital expense as part of the efforts to comply with these anticipated so  nox  and mercury rules 
scr systems for nox controls have already been installed on certain units and one additional scr will be installed at another ipl unit in on november   the indiana utility regulatory commission approved rate based construction of additional clean coal technology equipment up to million 
these capital expenditures will be directed at so  so and mercury emissions reductions from ipl s power plants and at reductions of fine pm pollution in the atmosphere 
ipl currently estimates total additional capital expenditures related to emissions reductions in  and of million  million and million  respectively 
the new york state department of environmental conservation nysdec recently adopted regulations requiring electric generators to reduce so emissions by below current us clean air act standards 
the us regulations began to be phased in beginning on january  with implementation to be completed by january  these regulations also establish stringent nox reduction requirements year round  rather than just during the summertime ozone season 
as a result  in order to operate our four generation facilities located in new york  installation of pollution control technology will likely be required 
see item legal proceedings  for a description of a recent consent decree that includes provisions related to emissions at these facilities 
poor ozone air quality in the houston galveston  texas area has resulted in the creation of a regional nox cap and trade program 
this program would impact the aes deepwater petroleum coke fired power plant by allocating it insufficient nox allowances which would make it impossible economically for the plant to operate past in response to the implementation of this program  aes has planned a million environmental capital project at aes deepwater  which includes adding an scr nox control system by may  thereby enabling aes deepwater to economically operate past in july  epa published the regional haze rule to reduce haze and protect visibility in designated federal areas 
on april   epa proposed amendments to the regional haze rule that would  among other things  set guidelines for determining when to require the installation of best available retrofit technology  at older plants 
the proposed amendment to the regional haze rule would require states to consider the visibility impacts of the haze produced by an individual facility when determining whether that facility must install potentially costly emissions controls 
states are required to submit to the epa their regional haze state implementation plans between and  depending on whether and when the epa determines that state is in attainment or non attainment of pm air quality standards 
various members of congress have proposed new legislation that  if passed into law  could require reductions in power plant air emissions beyond the requirements described above 
president bush supports clear skies legislation that would cap emissions of three pollutants nox  so and mercury  with voluntary reductions of co in january  senators inhofe and voinovich introduced a version of the clear skies act that included caps on nox  nox and mercury emissions but did not include a cap voluntary or otherwise on co on march   the senate environmental committee rejected the proposed clear skies legislation 
several committee members have requested future analysis and information  which is likely to significantly delay any reconsideration of the proposed legislation this year 
in europe we are  and will continue to be  required to reduce air emissions from our facilities to comply with applicable european union eu directives  including the large combustion plant directive the lcpd  which sets emissions standards for nox  nox  and pm for large scale industrial combustion facilities for all member states 
as of june  coal plants were required to opt in or opt out of the lcpd emissions standards 
those facilities that opted out must cease all operations by  and may not operate for more than  hours after those that opt in  like our aes kilroot facility  in the united kingdom must invest in abatement technology to achieve specific so reductions 
aes kilroot plans to incur costs of million during  and total cumulative costs of approximately million 
aes s other coal plants in europe have also opted in but will not need to implement any additional abatement technology 
in july  the eu directive on greenhouse gas ghg emission allowance trading the directive was adopted 
pursuant to the directive  a co emissions cap and trade program known as the eu emissions trading scheme eu ets was created  which requires member states to limit emissions of co within their countries 
to do so  member states will be required to implement eu approved national allocation plans naps 
under the naps  member states will be responsible for allocating limited co allowances within their borders 
the eu ets does not dictate how these allocations are to be made and naps that have been submitted thus far have varied their approaches to sector allocation and allocation methodologies 
for these and other reasons  there remain significant uncertainties regarding the application of the eu ets 
based on our current analyses  we expect that certain aes businesses will be under allocated and others will be over allocated 
at present  we cannot predict whether compliance with the eu ets will have a material impact on our operations or results 
on february   the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change kyoto became effective 
kyoto requires countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their ghg emissions including co aes has generation operations in seven countries that have ratified kyoto  however  we do not expect kyoto implementation to have a material impact on our revenues or projected earnings during the period 
over the course of the next several years  as decisions surrounding implementation of kyoto become more detailed  we will have a better understanding of the impact of kyoto on the company 
at present  we cannot predict whether compliance with koyoto will have a material impact on our operations or results 
water emissions 
our facilities are subject to a variety of rules governing water discharges 
in particular  we are evaluating the impact of the us clean water act section b rule regarding cooling water intake 
to protect fish and other aquatic organisms  the rule requires existing steam electric generating facilities to utilize the best technology available for cooling water intake structures 
we believe that many of our facilities will be affected by this rule 
to comply  we must first prepare a comprehensive demonstration study to assess each facility s effect on the local aquatic environment 
because each facility s design  location  existing control equipment and results of impact assessments must be taken into consideration  costs will likely vary 
the timing of capital expenditures to achieve compliance with this rule will vary from site to site  and may begin as early as for some of our us plants 
at present  however  we cannot predict whether compliance with the b rule will have a material impact on our operations or results 
item properties we maintain offices in many places around the world  generally pursuant to the provisions of long and short term leases  none of which are material 
with a few exceptions  our facilities  which are described in item of this form k  are subject to mortgages or other liens or encumbrances as part of the project s related finance facility 
in addition  the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased 
however  in a few instances  no accompanying project financing exists for the facility  and in a few of these cases  the land interest may not be subject to any encumbrance and is owned outright by the subsidiary or affiliate 
item legal proceedings in september  a judge in the brazilian appellate state court of minas gerais granted a temporary injunction suspending the effectiveness of a shareholders agreement between southern electric brasil participacoes  ltda 
seb and the state of minas gerais concerning cemig 
aes s investment in cemig is through seb 
this shareholders agreement granted seb certain rights and powers in respect of cemig special rights 
in march  a lower state court in minas gerais held the shareholders agreement invalid where it purported to grant seb the special rights and enjoined the exercise of special rights 
in august  the state appellate court denied an appeal of the merits decision  and extended the injunction 
in october  seb filed two appeals against the decision on the merits of the state appellate court  one to the federal superior court and the other to the supreme court of justice 
the state appellate court denied access of these two appeals to the higher courts  and in august  seb filed two interlocutory appeals against such decision  one directed to the federal superior court and the other to the supreme court of justice 
these appeals continue to be pending 
seb intends to vigorously pursue by all legal means a restoration of the value of its investment in cemig  however  there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts 
failure to prevail in this matter may limit the seb s influence on the daily operation of cemig

executive summary and overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  and other information included in this report 
who are we aes is a global power company managed to meet the growing demand for electricity in ways that benefit all of our stakeholders 
aes is a holding company that through its subsidiaries and affiliates owns and operates a portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses in countries 
we seek to capture the benefits of our global expertise and economies of scale in our operations 
predictable cash flow  an efficient capital structure and world class operating performance are the focus of our management efforts 
what businesses are we in we operate two principal businesses 
the first is the generation of power for sale to utilities and other wholesale customers 
the second is the operation of utilities which distribute power to retail  commercial  industrial and governmental customers 
each principal business generates approximately one half of the company s revenues 
our financial results are reported as four business segments on a regulated and non regulated basis by region  which further refines our core business structure generation contract generation competitive supply the generation business segments earnings and cash flows may be significantly affected by the reliability of generating capacity at our existing facilities  newly completed projects or acquisitions of generating facilities  demand for power beyond minimum requirements under the contract generation segment power sales agreements  or the demand for power as affected by weather conditions in our competitive supply segment  prices for power and fuel supply requirements  the credit quality of the counterparties to our power sales agreements  changes in our cost structure  including cost associated with operation  maintenance and repair  transmission access  insurance and environmental compliance  including expenditures relating to environmental emission equipment or environmental remediation  changes in laws or regulations  and changes in the foreign currency exchange rates for certain of our facilities outside the united states 
our contract generation and competitive supply segments consist of approximately gigawatts of generating capacity from power plants in countries 
our contract generation plants have contractually limited their exposure to electricity price volatility by entering into power sales agreements of five years or longer for or more of their output capacity 
exposure to fuel supply risks is also limited through long term fuel supply contracts or through fuel tolling arrangements 
through these contractual agreements  the businesses generally reduce commodity and electricity price volatility and thereby increase the predictability of their cash flows and earnings 
our competitive supply segment consists primarily of power plants selling electricity to wholesale customers through competitive markets and  as a result  the cash flows and earnings of such businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price of natural gas  coal and other fuels 
however  for our us competitive supply business which includes a fleet of low cost coal fired plants in new york  we typically hedge the majority of our fuel exposure on a rolling two year basis 
utilities large utilities growth distribution the utility business segments earnings and cash flows may be significantly affected by changes in economic conditions and policies  demand for power  including demand variability associated with weather conditions  prices for power and fuel supply requirements  the extent of commercial losses  which include fraudulent activity by our customers  changes in our cost structure  including costs associated with operation  maintenance and repair  insurance and environmental compliance  including expenditures relating to environmental emissions or environmental remediation  changes in laws or regulation  including changes in electricity tariff rates and our ability to obtain tariff adjustments for increased expenses  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly in brazil and venezuela 
these combined businesses consist of distribution companies in eight countries with over million end user customers 
the large utilities segment includes three large utilities located in the us ipl  brazil eletropaulo and venezuela edc all of which maintain a monopoly franchise within a defined service area 
the challenge within these businesses includes providing dependable and quality service to a large base of customers  and effectively being able to achieve appropriate returns through tariff increases 
while we are exposed to currency  political and economic risks within developing countries  we also have excellent growth opportunities given increasing demand in these markets 
our growth distribution segment is comprised of our interests in electricity distribution facilities located in developing countries where the demand for electricity is expected to grow at a higher rate than in more developed parts of the world 
however  these businesses often face particular challenges associated with their presence in developing countries such as outdated equipment  significant electricity theft related losses  cultural problems associated with customer safety and non payment  emerging economies  and potentially less stable governments or regulatory regimes 
what was our key focus for in  we focused on strengthening our balance sheet  improving the operations of our existing portfolio of assets and pursuing disciplined growth 
we strengthened our balance sheet by paying down parent level debt  extending the average maturity of our parent debt and restructuring the debt of several key subsidiaries 
in our operating businesses  we focused on improving the strategic sourcing of critical supplies and services  obtaining tariff increases and favorable regulatory treatment of new investments  reducing the impact of forced outages on our generation plants and reducing the impact of commercial losses on our utilities and distribution businesses 
was an important transition year for us as we completed several years of restructuring efforts 
it was also a year of strong financial performance with solid improvements in revenue  gross margin and earnings per share  all building the foundation for long term growth 
operating highlights in millions  except per share data revenue gross margin gross margin as a of revenue net cash provided by operating activities diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations revenue we achieved revenues in of billion  an increase of from billion in the prior year largely reflecting increased pricing due to successful pass through of tariff increases in our large utilities and the impact of several new projects coming on line within our generation business 
gross margin gross margin increased over to billion with higher contributions from all four of our segments 
in addition  gross margin as a percent of sales increased to versus in the prior year 
earnings per share diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from to in although our key operating measures improved substantially year over year  the company was negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction losses related to subsidiary debt denominated in us dollars and higher minority interest related to our brazil restructuring 
operating cash flow we generated  million of net cash from operating activities which was million lower than this year over year decline was largely driven by a return to normalcy in our brazilian utility business which had dramatically extended its vendor payments in while going through the debt restructuring process 
days payables outstanding in this business were at at the end of and are now at a more acceptable level of as of the end of strategic highlights strengthening our balance sheet in  we continued to make progress in strengthening our financial position in a number of ways 
aes reduced overall recourse debt at the parent level by approximately million to approximately billion at year end 
we also continued to extend a portion of our debt repayments associated with our scheduled future debt maturities by refinancing approximately million of intermediate term recourse debt at the parent level with longer term debt 
these new debt obligations also bear lower interest costs than the debt refinanced 
recourse debt at the parent level with maturities of one year or less at december  was million 
we expect to either repay or refinance this debt at or prior to maturity 
this debt is a junior subordinated debenture that bears a coupon rate of 
we can provide no assurance that we can refinance this debt with terms as favorable as the current debt terms 
at the subsidiary level  we refinanced or restructured more than billion of non recourse debt in most of these efforts resulted in extended maturity dates and amortization schedules 
in addition  we also added approximately billion of non recourse debt at the subsidiary level 
most new debt was used to fund the construction of new electric generation plants or other capital expenditures in indiana  qatar  cameroon  hungary and spain 
additionally  one of our subsidiaries issued approximately million of debt to return a portion of our investment initially contributed to our ebute project in nigeria 
liquidity defined in the parent company liquidity section in item of this form k as cash and equivalents plus undrawn available commitments under credit facilities at the parent level on december  was million 
the liquidity decreased from billion at the end of primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce aggregate recourse debt levels at the parent 
the aggregate amount and specific sources of cash flow relative to debt levels are important factors for the rating agencies in determining whether the company s credit ratings should improve 
currency  political and regulatory risks tend to be the biggest variables to sustaining cash flows at predictable levels 
our large contractual and concession based cash flow from our contract generation and large utility businesses is a mitigating factor to these variables 
in  more than of cash distributions to the parent were from our us large utility and worldwide contract generation businesses 
restructuring key subsidiaries during and we embarked upon a significant restructuring plan aimed at divesting non core assets and raising cash to pay down debt  discontinuing underperforming businesses and restructuring significant aspects of several of our south american businesses 
the latter efforts were focused on improving the businesses long term prospects for generating acceptable returns on invested capital or extending short term debt maturities 
during we completed a number of debt restructuring and refinancing transactions of over billion of non recourse debt largely in brazil  chile  venezuela  colombia  and the us 
although these transactions have improved the financial condition of these businesses  many of these businesses are highly leveraged 
as a result  these businesses may be significantly limited in their ability to meet debt service obligations or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions 
however  we will continue our efforts to improve the financial condition of these businesses 
a major part of this achievement included the restructuring of our brazilian utility through successful negotiations with our lenders  the brazilian national bank for economic and social development bndes  whereby they took a economic interest in our brazil distribution business and two generating facilities in exchange for the cancellation of million of debt and accrued interest 
the remaining indebtedness of million was re profiled at a stated interest rate with extended maturities 
we discontinued seven underperforming businesses and successfully concluded our negotiations to transfer or sell these operations with the final dispositions of ede este  wolf hollow and granite ridge in the fourth quarter of targeting business development in  we brought three power plants on line and in so doing added approximately mw of capacity in three countries qatar  panama and cameroon 
we entered the wind generation business through our current investment in us windforce and recent acquisition of another wind generation business seawest 
these investments have the potential to make us a top us wind developer and operator with interests in over  mws of development projects in thirteen states 
we believe that wind generation will be one of the highest growth markets in organization for economic co operation and development countries within the next five years and is a logical extension of our current contract generation business 
we also are currently involved in developing a mw lignite project in bulgaria 
although the project has a power purchase agreement with the state owned transmission company  commencement of construction is pending completion of development  receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals and financing 
commercial operation of the first mw unit is expected in finally  we are working to develop a million project to build a liquefied natural gas lng terminal in ocean cay  bahamas  which would include a mile natural gas pipeline from the terminal to an access site in florida  pending approvals from the bahamian government 
improving operating performance over the past two years we have developed key programs aimed at helping us continue to organically grow our business  provide better service to our customers  manage our costs and safeguard our people 
these include the following efforts strategic sourcing initiatives in we launched a strategic sourcing initiative to avoid costs and capture cost reductions through the implementation of improved purchasing practices throughout the company 
during  we evaluated and strategically sourced key spending categories including capital  services  materials and fuel 
we are pursuing cost avoidance and cost reduction savings using best practice methodologies to improve our pricing through volume purchasing and product mix changes while pursuing cost reduction opportunities related to inventory management and parts rationalization 
a core component of our program also includes developing supplier relationships to leverage our purchasing power and improve overall service and response times 
plant performance in our generation businesses  we track plant reliability as a key performance indicator 
for  our estimated average fleet availability declined from to 
this measure is comprised of two key elements a scheduled outage factor and a forced outage factor 
the forced outage factor  which is influenced by improving operating performance through effective maintenance and operating practices  has improved nearly over the last two years 
in  our annual forced outage factor improved from in to in the scheduled outage factor was nearly higher in versus as the company made strategic timing decisions concerning planned maintenance that would least impact our contractual commitments 
loss reduction our large non us utility businesses have embarked on comprehensive programs to track and reduce revenue losses  defined as the difference between energy purchased or generated and energy billed to customers 
these losses can result from several factors including energy losses during the heat conversion process  ie technical losses and non technical losses as a result of metering issues and customer theft 
progress has been made particularly in brazil on improved metering practices  field training of inspectors  identification of commercial fraud and the establishment of a rebilling and collection process 
this is a long term effort which requires both cultural and systematic process change 
what are our key challenges there are several challenges we face in achieving our plans for and beyond 
these include the recent emergence of increased and new global competition in our markets 
in the united states and europe there has been an emergence of multiple new financial sponsors aggressively acquiring assets 
internationally  there has been a rapid increase in the number of new  regionally focused and aggressive competitors 
these factors have led to more competition and an increase in the prices for assets in both secondary asset sales and privatizations 
the global power market is extremely large and offers multiple opportunities 
in the european union eu  the market rules require a liberalized competitive wholesale power market as a condition for eu entry 
however  there are a number of considerations that may limit the number of available near term opportunities in other markets 
first  in the united states and  to a lesser extent  western europe there is limited need for new capacity  reducing the number of available greenfield opportunities in the most stable markets 
many states in the united states have slowed or reversed their trends towards liberalization  thereby reducing the number of available opportunities 
internationally  planned privatization programs have been deferred for specific local reasons 
in the markets outside the united states that are liberalizing the rules  those rules are being designed such that the risks are too great to justify the level or returns currently available 
hence we have decided to either not participate in those markets or to only do so in a limited manner and wait for a more balanced set of rules or regulations to emerge 
political environment several of our businesses operate in politically unstable environments 
the impact of governmental change and uncertainty impacts foreign currency volatility discussed below  our ability to maintain or attract needed financing as well and our ability to effectively recover costs through routine tariff or regulatory reset proceedings 
foreign currency risk a significant portion of our business portfolio is located outside of the us and therefore usually subject to both currency translation and transaction risk 
our financial position and results of operations have been significantly affected in the past by significant fluctuations in the value of the argentine peso  brazilian real and venezuelan bolivar relative to the us dollar 
we hedge certain transaction exposures principally related to debt  and have restructured debt into local currency denomination to minimize risk when possible 
although these actions may have mitigated negative impacts in certain cases  movements within currencies are difficult to predict and continue to have a significant impact on our financial results 
regulatory risk due to the regulated nature of the utilities business  we are subject to regulatory risk related to changes in tariff agreements  and existing laws and provisions 
changes in regulation may impact our future operations  cash flows and financial condition 
long term contracts several of our power generation plants operate on a long term contract basis with one or a limited number of contracts related to both the fuel supply and power demand 
the remaining periods for these long term contracts range from to years 
the ability of our customers and suppliers to perform under these contracts and our ability to negotiate new contracts upon expiration may have a significant impact on our results of operations in the future 
looking ahead what is our key focus for given the progress we have made in executing our restructuring programs  we are poised to continue to grow organically and through targeted and disciplined acquisition 
we also will continue to pursue our long term growth strategies on a disciplined basis 
we are targeting four different dimensions within our targeted growth initiatives to include expansion of existing business platforms  targeted acquisitions  greenfield development  and privatizations 
all of these areas of opportunity have a common theme which is to leverage our existing strengths and capitalize on favorable market conditions to improve gross margin  earnings per share and cash flows 
the catalysts to further growth include both external and internal factors such as continued electricity demand growth in key markets  attraction of private capital for emerging markets  and government policies that encourage the development of new areas of opportunity including renewable energy 
in each case  we will carefully consider whether proposed transactions have the appropriate risk reward profile 
critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of aes are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  which requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
aes s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
critical accounting estimates are described in this section 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate that would have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years 
the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes 
tax reserves have been established  which the company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments 
once established  reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves 
while the company believes that the amount of the tax estimates is reasonable  it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed current reserves in amounts that could be material 
a range of these amounts cannot be reasonably estimated at december   as they are primarily unasserted claims 
on october   the american jobs creation act the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
the company may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in the company has started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision in accordance with recently issued treasury department guidance 
the company expects to complete its evaluation early in the range of possible amounts that the company is considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and million 
the amount of income tax cannot be reasonably estimated 
long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  and assets to be disposed of when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable or the assets meet the held for sale criteria under sfas no 
these events or circumstances may include the relative pricing of wholesale electricity by region and the anticipated demand and cost of fuel 
if the carrying amount is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
for regulated assets  an impairment charge could be offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset  if rate recovery was probable 
for non regulated assets  an impairment charge would be recorded as a charge against earnings 
the fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than a forced or liquidation sale 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for measurement  if available 
in the absence of quoted market prices for identical or similar assets in active markets  fair value is estimated using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow projections or other indicators of fair value such as bids received  comparable sales or independent appraisals 
in connection with the periodic evaluation of long lived assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 the fair value of the asset can vary if different estimates and assumptions would have been used in our applied valuation techniques 
in cases of impairment described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  we made our best estimate of fair value using valuation methods based on the most current information at that time 
we have been in the process of divesting certain assets and their sales values can vary from the recorded fair value as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
fluctuations in realized sales proceeds versus the estimated fair value of the asset are generally due to a variety of factors including differences in subsequent market conditions  the level of bidder interest  timing and terms of the transactions  and management s analysis of the benefits of the transaction 
goodwill 
we review the carrying value of our goodwill annually during the fourth quarter 
we also review the carrying value of our goodwill periodically when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review is performed using estimates of fair value and includes discounted future cash flows 
if the carrying value of goodwill is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded 
pension and postretirement obligations 
certain of our foreign and domestic subsidiaries maintain defined benefit pension plans which we refer to as the pension plans  or the plans  covering substantially all of their respective employees 
pension benefits are generally based on years of credited service  age of the participant and average earnings 
of the thirteen pension plans existing at december   two exist at domestic subsidiaries and eleven exist at foreign subsidiaries 
the measurement of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates salary growth retirement rates inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
sensitivity of our pension funded status and stockholders equity to the indicated increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption is shown below 
although not an estimate  we ve also included sensitivity around the actual return on pension assets 
note that these sensitivities may be asymmetric  and are specific to the base conditions at year end they also may not be additive  so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown 
the december  funded status is affected by december  assumptions 
pension expense for is affected by december  assumptions 
the impact on our funded status  equity and us pension expense from a one percentage point change in these assumptions is shown below in millions increase of in the discount rate decrease of in the discount rate increase of in the long term rate of return on plan assets decrease of in the long term rate of return on plan assets regulatory assets and liabilities 
the company accounts for its regulated operations under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
as a result  aes records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under gaap for non regulated entities 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that are not likely to be incurred 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes  recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the asset write offs would be required to be recognized in operating income 
new accounting pronouncements consolidation of variable interest entities 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin or interpretation 
fin is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin consolidated financial statements  and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vie 
the primary objective of the interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  such entities are known as vies 
the interpretation requires an enterprise to consolidate a vie if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur or both 
an enterprise shall consider the rights and obligations conveyed by its variable interests in making this determination 
on december   the fasb issued interpretation no 
revised consolidation of variable interest entities fin r or revised interpretation  which partially deferred the effective date of fin for certain entities and makes other changes to fin  including a more complete definition of variable interest and an exemption for many entities defined as businesses 
the company applied fin in its financial statements relating to its interest in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities as of december   and applied fin r as of march  the application of fin r did not have an impact on the company s condensed consolidated financial statements for any quarter through december  share based payment 
in december  the fasb issued a revised sfas no 
sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r eliminates the intrinsic value method under apb as an alternative method of accounting for stock based awards by requiring that all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options for all outstanding years be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
it also revises the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment liabilities  forfeitures and modifications of stock based awards and clarifies sfas no 
s guidance related to measurement of fair value  classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation to reporting periods 
in addition  sfas no 
r amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
r for the interim period beginning july  using a modified version of prospective application 
the company may apply a modified retrospective application to periods before the required effective date 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
r no later than july   but has not determined what method it will use 
management is currently evaluating the effect of adoption of sfas no 
r  but does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  as the company had previously adopted income statement treatment for compensation related to share based payments under sfas no

we wrote off the goodwill associated with certain acquisitions where the current fair market value of such businesses was less than the current carrying value of the business  primarily as a result of reductions in fair value associated with lower than expected growth in electricity consumption compared to the original estimates made at the date of acquisition 
capital resources and liquidity overview we are a holding company that conducts all of our operations through subsidiaries 
we have  to the extent achievable  utilized non recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants  distribution companies and related assets 
this type of financing is non recourse to other subsidiaries and affiliates and to us as parent company  and is generally secured by the capital stock  physical assets  contracts and cash flow of the related subsidiary or affiliate 
at december   we had billion of recourse debt and billion of non recourse debt outstanding 
for more information on our long term debt see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in addition to the non recourse debt  if available  we  as the parent company  provide a portion  or in certain instances all  of the remaining long term financing or credit required to fund development  construction or acquisition 
these investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or loans  which are subordinated to the project s non recourse loans 
we generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations and or the proceeds from our issuances of debt  common stock and other securities 
similarly  in certain of our businesses  we may provide financial guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity with our subsidiaries 
in such circumstances  if a subsidiary defaults on its payment or supply obligation  we will be responsible for the subsidiary s obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support 
we intend to continue to seek where possible non recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that our affiliates or we may develop  construct or acquire 
however  depending on market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses  non recourse debt may not be available or available on economically attractive terms 
if we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary that is under construction or has near term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non recourse debt  such subsidiary may become insolvent and we may lose our investment in such subsidiary 
additionally  if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer  the subsidiary may need to restructure the non recourse debt financing 
if such subsidiary is unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non recourse debt  we may lose our investment in such subsidiary 
as a result of aes parent s below investment grade rating  counter parties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support 
accordingly  with respect to both new and existing commitments  we may be required to provide some other form of assurance  such as a letter of credit  to backstop or replace our credit support 
we may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counter parties 
in addition  to the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties  this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs 
at december   we had provided outstanding financial and performance related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our subsidiaries  which were limited by the terms of the agreements  in an aggregate of approximately million including those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below 
at december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding  which operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development activities and subsidiary operations 
all of these letters of credit were provided under our revolver 
we pay letter of credit fees ranging from to per annum on the outstanding amounts 
in addition  we had million in surety bonds outstanding at december  many of our subsidiaries including those in central and south america depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs 
the inability to raise capital on favorable terms  to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may adversely affect those subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses in brazil and venezuela 
management believes that cash on hand  along with cash generated through operations  and our financing availability will be sufficient to fund normal operations  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements 
capital expenditures we spent million and  million on capital expenditures in and  respectively 
we anticipate capital expenditures during to approximate the amount in planned capital expenditures include new project construction costs  environmental pollution control construction and expenditures for existing assets to increase their useful lives 
capital expenditures for are expected to be financed using internally generated cash provided by operations and project level financing 
cash flows at december   we had  million of cash and cash equivalents representing a decrease of million from december  the company paid down in excess of million of debt and funded approximately million of property additions from operating cash flow generated this year and the use of some of our existing cash balances 
operating activities change in millions increase in accounts receivable increase in inventory decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities total working capital the cash flows provided by operating activities totaled  million during  which was million lower than the primary reason for the slight decrease in cash flows from operations was an increase in net earnings adjusted for non cash items of million which was more than offset by million of changes in working capital 
the working capital change was mainly driven by changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the change in prepaid expenses and other current assets is being driven by our large utilities segment 
the change is related to a settlement of a receivable from the brazilian wholesale electricity market mae regulatory body in for energy capacity that was sold in the market in the prior year when demand for energy was low 
in  the settlement from mae was much less as the demand for electricity stabilized 
the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities also was driven by our large utilities and contract generation segments 
in the large utilities segment  the majority of the change is due to the payment of outstanding payables in related to the period prior to the debt restructuring in brazil 
our business in venezuela experienced a slow down in accounts payable payments at the end of due to the political situation in that country 
those payments were caught up on in the beginning of in the contract generation segment we had a build up in of construction liabilities at one of our plants in the middle east due to the plant approaching its commercial operations date 
when the plant began operations in the construction related liabilities were paid 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled million during the cash used in investing activities includes million for property additions  an increase in debt service reserve and other assets of million  and other cash inflows of million 
the increase in cash flows used in investing activities is due to an increase in debt service reserves and other assets of million from the prior year and a reduction in the proceeds from the sale of assets of  million 
this is offset by a reduction from in property additions and restricted cash of million and million respectively 
debt service reserves and other assets increased mainly as a result of the construction activity at our cartagena plant due to increased equity contributions which were placed into an escrow deposit 
in  we received approximately million of proceeds from the sale of our subsidiaries 
the decrease in property additions in is attributable to the completion of construction projects in the caribbean and middle east of million and million respectively 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million during  which primarily consists of refinancing and principal payments cash outflow of million  net of issuances  and payments for deferred financing costs of million 
the increase in cash used in financing activities in primarily reflects the reduction in our borrowings of  million compared to and the decline in proceeds from the issuance of stock 
we reduced our borrowings by approximately billion on our parent recourse debt in comparison to borrowings in in we received million in proceeds from stock option exercises compared to proceeds of million in from our stock offering and proceeds of million from stock option exercises

parent company liquidity because of the non recourse nature of most of our indebtedness  we believe that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is an important measure of liquidity 
our principal sources of liquidity at the parent company level are dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries  including refinancing proceeds  proceeds from debt and equity financings at the parent company level  including borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and proceeds from asset sales 
our cash requirements at the parent company level through the end of are primarily to fund interest and preferred dividends  principal repayments of debt  construction commitments  other equity commitments  taxes  and parent company overhead and development costs 
during the past three years  we undertook numerous actions designed to increase parent liquidity  lengthen parent debt maturities  and reduce parent debt and other contractual obligations  both contingent and non contingent 
these actions are consistent with our strategic goals of improving the credit profile of both the parent and the consolidated company in order to reduce our financial risk and improve our credit rating by the major rating agencies

as a result of the actions described above  we reduced recourse debt by approximately million and increased our average term of our recourse debt maturities from years at december  to years at december  the following table sets forth our parent company contingent contractual obligations as of december  contingent contractual obligations amount number of agreements exposure range for each agreement in millions guarantees letters of credit under the revolver surety bonds total we have a varied portfolio of performance related contingent contractual obligations 
amounts related to the balance sheet items represent credit enhancements made by us at the parent company level and by other third parties for the benefit of the lenders associated with the non recourse debt recorded as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these obligations are designed to cover potential risks and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur 
the risks associated with these obligations include change of control  construction cost overruns  political risk  tax indemnities  spot market power prices  supplier support and liquidated damages under power sales agreements for projects in development  under construction and operating 
while we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations during or beyond that are not recorded on the balance sheet  many of the events which would give rise to such an obligation are beyond our control 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder 
while we believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs through the end of  this belief is based on a number of material assumptions  including  without limitation  assumptions about exchange rates  power market pool prices and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends 
in addition  our project subsidiaries ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us at the parent company level is subject to certain limitations contained in project loans  governmental provisions and other agreements 
we can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
we have met our interim needs for shorter term and working capital financing at the parent company level with a secured revolving credit facility of million 
we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at december  at december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
various debt instruments at the parent company level  including our senior secured credit facilities  senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes contain certain restrictive covenants 
the covenants provide for  among other items limitations on other indebtedness  liens  investments and guarantees  restrictions on dividends and redemptions and payments of unsecured and subordinated debt and the use of proceeds  restrictions on mergers and acquisitions  sales of assets  leases  transactions with affiliates and off balance sheet and derivative arrangements  and maintenance of certain financial ratios 
non recourse debt financing while the lenders under our non recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the parent company  defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity  including  without limitation reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the parent level during the time period of any default  triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee  letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary  causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets  and triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the parent level 
for example  our revolving credit agreement and outstanding senior notes  senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes at the parent level include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries 
in addition  our revolving credit agreement at the parent level includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries 
some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness 
the total debt classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to such defaults was million at december  none of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that currently meet the applicable definition of materiality in aes s corporate debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit an acceleration under such indebtedness 
however  as a result of additional dispositions of assets  other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations  it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a material subsidiary and thereby upon an acceleration trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the aes parent company s senior notes  senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes 
off balance sheet arrangements in may  one of our subsidiaries acquired six electric generating plants from new york state electric and gas 
concurrently  the subsidiary sold two of the plants to an unrelated third party for million and simultaneously entered into a leasing arrangement with the unrelated party 
we have accounted for this transaction as a sale leaseback transaction with operating lease treatment 
accordingly  we have not recorded these assets on our books and we expense periodic lease payments  which amounted to million in  as incurred 
the lease obligations bear an imputed interest rate of approximately which approximates fair market value 
we are not subject to any additional liabilities or contingencies if the arrangement terminates  and we believe that the dissolution of the off balance sheet arrangement would have minimal effects on our operating cash flows 
the terms of the lease include restrictive covenants such as the maintenance of certain coverage ratios 
as of december   we fulfilled a lease requirement on the subsidiary s behalf by funding an additional liquidity account  as defined in the lease agreement  in the form of a million letter of credit 
however  the subsidiary is required to replenish or replace this letter of credit in the event it is drawn upon or requires replacement 
historically  the plants have satisfied the restrictive covenants of the lease  and there are no known trends or uncertainties that would indicate that the lease will be terminated early 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a more complete discussion of this transaction 
our subsidiary ipl formed ipl funding corporation ipl funding in to purchase  on a revolving basis  up to million of the retail accounts receivable and related collections of ipl in exchange for a note payable 
ipl funding is not consolidated by ipl or ipalco since it meets requirements set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities to be considered a qualified special purpose entity 
ipl funding has entered into a purchase facility with unrelated parties the purchasers pursuant to which the purchasers agree to purchase from ipl funding  on a revolving basis  up to million of the receivables purchased from ipl 
during  this agreement was extended through october  as of december  and  the aggregate amount of receivables ipl has sold to ipl funding and ipl funding has sold to the purchasers pursuant to this purchase facility was million 
accounts receivable on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets are stated net of the million sold 
the net cash flows between ipl and ipl funding are limited to cash payments made by ipl to ipl funding for interest charges and processing fees 
these payments totaled million for each of the three years ended december   and  respectively 
ipl retains servicing responsibilities through its role as a collection agent for the amounts due on the purchased receivables 
ipl and ipl funding provide certain indemnities to the purchasers  including indemnification in the event that there is a breach of representations and warranties made with respect to the purchased receivables 
ipl funding and ipl each have agreed to indemnify the purchasers on an after tax basis for any and all damages  losses  claims  liabilities  penalties  taxes  costs and expenses at any time imposed on or incurred by the indemnified parties arising out of or otherwise relating to the purchase facility  subject to certain limitations as defined in the purchase facility 
the transfers of receivables to ipl funding are recorded as sales however no gain or loss is recorded on the sale 
under the receivables purchase facility  if ipl fails to maintain certain financial covenants regarding interest coverage and debt to capital ratios  it would constitute a termination event 
ipl is in compliance with such covenants 
as a result of ipl s current credit rating  the facility agent has the ability to i replace ipl as the collection agent  and ii declare a lock box event 
under a lock box event or a termination event  the facility agent has the ability to require all proceeds of purchased receivables of ipl to be directed to lock box accounts within days of notifying ipl 
a termination event would also i give the facility agent the option to take control of the lock box account  and ii give the purchasers the option to discontinue the purchase of new receivables and cause all proceeds of the purchased receivables to be used to reduce the purchaser s investment and to pay other amounts owed to the purchasers and the facility agent 
this would have the effect of reducing the operating capital available to ipl by the aggregate amount of such purchased receivables currently million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview regarding market risks we are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
we often utilize financial instruments and other contracts to hedge against such fluctuations 
we also utilize financial and commodity derivatives for the purpose of hedging exposures to market risk 
we generally do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risks we are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable rate debt  fixed rate debt and trust preferred securities  as well as interest rate swap and option agreements 
depending on whether a plant s capacity payments or revenue stream is fixed or varies with inflation  we partially hedge against interest rate fluctuations by arranging fixed rate or variable rate financing 
in certain cases  we execute interest rate swap  cap and floor agreements to effectively fix or limit the interest rate exposure on the underlying financing 
foreign exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risk that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
a key component of this risk is that some of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates utilize currencies other than our consolidated reporting currency  the us dollar 
additionally  certain of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered into monetary obligations in us dollars or currencies other than their own functional currencies 
primarily  we are exposed to changes in the us dollar brazilian real exchange rate  the us dollar venezuelan bolivar exchange rate and the us dollar argentine peso exchange rate 
whenever possible  these subsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes in foreign exchange rates 
we also use foreign currency forward and swap agreements  where possible  to manage our risk related to certain foreign currency fluctuations 
commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity  natural gas and coal 
although we primarily consist of businesses with long term contracts or retail sales concessions  a portion of our current and expected future revenues are derived from businesses without significant long term revenue or supply contracts 
these competitive supply businesses subject our results of operations to the volatility of electricity  coal and natural gas prices in competitive markets 
our businesses hedge certain aspects of their net open positions in the us we have used a hedging strategy  where appropriate  to hedge our financial performance against the effects of fluctuations in energy commodity prices 
the implementation of this strategy involves the use of commodity forward contracts  futures  swaps and options as well as long term supply contracts for the supply of fuel and electricity 
value at risk one approach we use to assess our risk and our subsidiaries risk is value at risk var 
var measures the potential loss in a portfolio s value due to market volatility  over a specified time horizon  stated with a specific degree of probability 
the quantification of market risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse markets and instruments 
we adopted the var approach because we feel that statistical models of risk measurement  such as var  provide an objective  independent assessment of a component of our risk exposure 
our use of var requires a number of key assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level for expected losses  the holding period for liquidation and the treatment of risks outside the var methodology  including liquidity risk and event risk 
var  therefore  is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
additionally  var represents changes in fair value and not the economic exposure to aes and its affiliates 
because of the inherent limitations of var  including those specific to analytic var  in particular the assumption that values or returns are normally distributed  we rely on var as only one component in our risk assessment process 
in addition to using var measures  we perform stress and scenario analyses to estimate the economic impact of market changes to our portfolio of businesses 
we use these results to complement the var methodology 
in addition  the relevance of the var described herein as a measure of economic risk is limited and needs to be considered in light of the underlying business structure 
the interest rate component of var is due to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps 
these instruments themselves would expose a holder to market risk  however  utilizing these fixed rate debt instruments as part of a fixed price contract generation business mitigates the overall exposure to interest rates 
similarly  our foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments are often part of businesses which have revenues denominated in the same currency  thus offsetting the exposure 
we have performed a company wide var analysis of all of our material financial assets  liabilities and derivative instruments 
the var calculation incorporates numerous variables that could impact the fair value of our instruments  including interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices  as well as correlation within and across these variables 
we express analytic var herein as a dollar amount of the potential loss in the fair value of our portfolio based on a confidence level and a one day holding period 
our commodity analysis is an analytic var utilizing a variance covariance analysis within the commodity transaction management system 
during the year ended december   our average daily var for interest rate sensitive instruments was million 
the daily var for interest rate sensitive instruments was highest at the end of the second quarter  and equaled million 
the daily var for interest rate sensitive instruments was lowest at the end of the fourth quarter  and equaled million 
these amounts include the financial instruments that serve as hedges and the underlying hedged items 
during the year ended december   our average daily var for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments was million 
the daily var for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments was highest at the end of the second quarter  and equaled million 
the daily var for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments was lowest at the end of the first quarter  and equaled million 
these amounts include the financial instruments that serve as hedges and the underlying hedged items 
during the year ended december   our average daily var for commodity price sensitive instruments was million 
the daily var for commodity price sensitive instruments was highest at the end of the fourth quarter  and equaled million 
the daily var for commodity price sensitive instruments was lowest at the end of the third quarter  and equaled million 
these amounts include the financial instruments that serve as hedges and do not include the underlying physical assets or contracts that are not permitted to be settled in cash 
trending daily var can provide insight into market volatility or consistency of a company s financial strategy 
the table below details the average daily var for aes foreign exchange  interest rates and commodity activities over the past three years 
since aes has seen a substantial decline in foreign exchange volatility  particularly the brazilian real and argentine peso  which led to a decrease in var from million in to million in in regards to interest rates  aes has made efforts during to increase the percentage of its portfolio of fixed versus floating rate debt 
this has in part led to the increase in var from million in to million in the aes commodity var is reported for financially settled derivative products at its competitive supply business in new york state 
from to there has been an increase in term and magnitude of hedging activity which has led to the increase in the daily var from million to million 
average daily var in millions foreign exchange interest rate commodity
