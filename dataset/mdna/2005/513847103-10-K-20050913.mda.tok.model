item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a diversified manufacturer and marketer of consumer products including specialty foods for the retail and foodservice markets  glassware and candles for the retail  industrial  floral and foodservice markets  and automotive accessories for the original equipment market and aftermarket 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important in understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended june  and our liquidity and capital resources as of june  and our fiscal year begins on july and ends on june in the discussion that follows  we analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity and contractual obligations 
we then provide a review of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we have made which we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recently issued accounting pronouncements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  all included elsewhere herein 
the forward looking statements in this section and other parts of this document involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption forward looking statements 
we recorded other income for proceeds received from the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of cdsoa for the year ended june  of million compared to million for the prior year 
this income represents distributions we received from the us government under cdsoa 
cdsoa  which applies to our candle operations  is intended to redress unfair dumping of imported products through cash payments to eligible affected companies 
such payments are in part dependent upon the amount of anti dumping duties collected by the us government on those products 
in the quarter ended march   we recorded a noncash impairment charge of million million after taxes relating to certain equipment in two of our business segments 
approximately million of the charge relates to the impairment of glassware manufacturing equipment in our glassware and candles segment 
approximately million of the charge relates to the impairment of certain idle manufacturing equipment in our automotive segment 
these impairments occurred due to inefficient production and a slowdown in demand for certain products associated with this equipment 
see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
on april   we announced our intent to close our automotive floor mat manufacturing facility located in waycross  georgia 
in fiscal  we recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of approximately million million after taxes 
during the fiscal year  we recorded an additional restructuring and impairment charge of million million after taxes for costs incurred during that period 
see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
on december   we purchased substantially all the operating assets of warren frozen foods  inc warren  a privately owned producer and marketer of frozen noodle and pasta products 
warren is reported in our specialty foods segment 
this acquisition s final purchase price was approximately million  including a net asset adjustment of approximately  as determined under the terms of the purchase agreement  and this transaction is discussed in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra 
this annual report on form k contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of the pslra and other applicable securities laws

summary of results the following is an overview of our consolidated results for the year ended june  net sales for the year ended june  increased to  million from the prior year total of  million 
gross margin decreased to million from the prior year comparable total of million 
net income for the current year was million or per diluted share  compared to million or per diluted share in the prior year 
our current year results continue to reflect an environment of heightened competition  increased pricing pressures and higher nonfood raw material costs 
we also experienced higher costs associated with freight and energy 
we have been able to maintain a strong balance sheet with no debt throughout this fiscal year 
our total consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments increased by million to million compared to the prior year total of million 
overall results were also affected by the funds received under cdsoa 
in fiscal  we received million under cdsoa compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal review of consolidated operations segment sales mix the relative proportion of sales contributed by each of our business segments can impact a year to year comparison of the consolidated statements of income 
the following table summarizes the sales mix over each of the last three years segment sales mix specialty foods glassware and candles automotive expressed as a percentage of consolidated net sales  may not add to due to rounding 
net sales and gross margin fiscal year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales specialty foods      glassware and candles      automotive      total      gross margin      gross margin as a percent of sales consolidated net sales during fiscal were led by further growth in the specialty foods segment and reached the record level of  million  increasing as compared to prior year sales of  million 
over the past two years  a business acquisition made within the specialty foods segment contributed approximately million growth in each year 
like many other consumer product companies  we experienced heightened competitive influences during this period  which impacted sales growth  particularly in our nonfood markets 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in compared with in and in a significant influence affecting the decline was the presence of increasing nonfood material costs and our limited ability to obtain much cost recovery through higher pricing 
higher levels of freight and energy costs were also broadly prevalent in fiscal despite modest improvement in food commodity costs  gross margins in the specialty foods segment were adversely impacted by issues involving sales mix  higher freight costs and certain operating inefficiencies 
compared to fiscal  the consolidated gross margin percentage for fiscal declined  as affected by higher food ingredient costs  rising raw material costs in the automotive segment  and the presence of price competition along with lower fixed cost absorption occurring in the glassware and candles segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses fiscal year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses      sg a expense as a percent of sales selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal totaled million and increased as compared with the total of million and increased million from the total of million 
the and fiscal totals included recoveries of bad debt totaling million and million  respectively  associated with the bankruptcy filing of kmart corporation 
we wrote off approximately million related to this bankruptcy in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively stable as a percentage of sales for the years ended june   and restructuring and impairment charge in the quarter ended march   we recorded a noncash impairment charge of million million after taxes relating to certain equipment in two of our business segments 
approximately million of the charge relates to the impairment of glassware manufacturing equipment in our glassware and candles segment 
approximately million of the charge relates to the impairment of certain idle manufacturing equipment in our automotive segment 
these impairments occurred due to inefficient production and a slowdown in demand for certain products associated with this equipment 
we determined that an impairment existed based on a comparison of the sum of the related  estimated undiscounted future cash flows with the assets carrying amounts 
we then compared the assets carrying amounts to their estimated fair value to determine the amount of impairment to be recorded 
in fiscal  we recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of approximately million million after taxes for costs incurred as of june  related to the closing of our automotive floor mat manufacturing facility located in waycross  georgia 
manufacturing effectively ceased as of june  the decision to close the plant was brought on by a decline in demand for compression molded rubber floor mats that resulted in excess segment capacity 
the fiscal cash costs associated with this closure totaled approximately million and included termination benefits and other closing costs  such as costs to remove and relocate certain equipment  costs to prepare the building for sale  and various other charges 
approximately million of the fiscal restructuring and impairment charge related to this facility s impairment of property  plant and equipment 
during the year ended june   we recorded an additional restructuring and impairment charge of million million after taxes for costs incurred during that period 
the majority of this charge resulted in cash outlays and consisted of other closing costs  such as costs to maintain the building and various other charges 
an analysis of our waycross restructuring activity and the related liability within the automotive segment is as follows in thousands accrual accrual at at cash june  cash june  charge outlays charge outlays waycross restructuring and impairment charge employee separation costs other costs subtotal asset impairment waycross restructuring and impairment charge  the restructuring accrual is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at june  and we expect that the remaining cash outlays for this plan will be immaterial to the overall consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of approximately million million after taxes related to the consolidation of certain glass manufacturing operations 
the charge consisted of employee separation costs  pension curtailment costs  closure and cleanup costs  and the writedown of property  plant and equipment having no future utility as a result of the restructuring decision 
the plant consolidation was substantially completed by june the liability that remains for this restructuring is immaterial to the overall consolidated financial statements 
operating income fiscal year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
operating income specialty foods      glassware and candles      automotive      corporate expenses    total      operating income as a percent of sales specialty foods glassware and candles automotive consolidated despite increased operating income in the specialty foods segment  declines in operating income in the other two segments  due to the factors discussed above  led to consolidated operating income for fiscal totaling million  a decrease from fiscal operating income of million 
the fiscal total had decreased from fiscal operating income totaling million 
other income expense in december  december and january  we received approximately million  million and million  respectively  from the us government under cdsoa 
these amounts were recorded within the accompanying financial statements as other income 
cdsoa  which applies to our candle operations  is intended to redress the unfair dumping of imported products through annual cash payments to eligible affected companies 
such payments are in part dependent upon the amount of anti dumping duties collected on those products 
the world trade organization has previously ruled that such payments are inconsistent with international trade rules 
additionally  there exists pending litigation to which we are not a party that challenges the constitutionality of cdsoa 
however  cdsoa continues to be in effect in the united states at this time 
uncertainties associated with this program leave us unable to predict the amounts  if any  we may be entitled to receive in the future 
income before income taxes as affected by the increased cdsoa payment  our income before income taxes for fiscal of million increased from the fiscal total of million 
as influenced by an increase in tax free interest income and a change in state tax laws within ohio  our effective tax rate was  and in fiscals  and  respectively 
net income per common share fiscal diluted earnings per share totaled  a increase from the prior year total of 
the latter amount was less than fiscal diluted earnings per share of 
earnings per share in each of the last three years has been beneficially affected by share repurchases  which have totaled approximately million over the three year period ended june  effective july   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to no longer be amortized but reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal or other means continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
amortization of other intangibles for  and was   and  respectively 
of the million in goodwill at june   approximately million related to the specialty foods segment and approximately million related to the automotive segment 
segment review specialty foods record net sales were again achieved by the specialty foods segment during fiscal  and operating income of million increased from the fiscal level of million  primarily as a result of the higher sales volume 
net sales during fiscal totaled million  a increase over the prior year total of million 
fiscal sales had increased over the fiscal total of million 
the percentage of retail customer sales was approximately during fiscal and compared to in fiscal the sales growth experienced in primarily resulted from internally generated improvements in both retail and foodservice markets 
fiscal also benefited from incremental sales totaling approximately million attributable to the december warren acquisition 
fiscal  the year of acquisition  had also benefited from incremental sales of approximately million 
the segment s retail customer sales growth over the last two years was most influenced by increased sales of such products as produce dips and dressings  frozen breads and frozen rolls 
the level of foodservice sales in fiscal benefited from the warren acquisition and growth in several frozen products 
the specialty foods segment operating income in fiscal totaled million  a increase from the fiscal total of million 
the level was below the fiscal level of million 
the increase in fiscal s operating income was influenced by higher sales volume and modestly lower raw material costs incurred during the year  although the segment also experienced increased freight and promotional costs during the same period 
increased food commodity costs impacted the year over year comparisons between fiscal and  as it was estimated that the impact of the increased soybean oil costs alone was in excess of million in entering fiscal  we anticipate that commodity costs may remain somewhat favorable in the first half of the fiscal year 
segment review glassware and candles net sales of the glassware and candles segment are comprised primarily of candles and related accessories 
segment sales during fiscal totaled million  and increased compared to fiscal net sales of million 
compared to net sales in fiscal totaling million  fiscal sales declined by 
fiscal candle sales grew primarily due to greater demand from existing customers  including placement in additional stores for which product was not previously provided 
glassware sales declined on weakness in demand for household drinkware and tableware 
the segment s fiscal sales decline was attributable to weakness in both candle and glassware demand  as affected by intense competitive pressures  including pricing 
toward the end of fiscal  candle sales increased as compared to the prior year period  benefiting from the mid year introduction of a new line of private label candle products 
the segment s operating income totaled million during fiscal  a decrease from the prior year total of million 
compared to fiscal operating income of million  fiscal income decreased by 
affecting fluctuations between years was income associated with the liquidations of lifo glassware inventory acquired at substantially lower costs in prior years 
such liquidations reduced cost of sales by approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the current year s operating income also included a noncash impairment charge of million relating to the impairment of certain glassware manufacturing equipment 
other factors influencing fiscal results relative to were the benefits of higher levels of sales and plant utilization  as mitigated by issues of higher material and energy costs 
fiscal results relative to were adversely affected by lower sales volumes  a competitive pricing environment and reduced production levels 
as discussed previously  a million restructuring charge related to the consolidation of glass manufacturing operations also impacted fiscal results 
future results will be sensitive to capacity utilization rates due to the high level of fixed manufacturing costs that exist in this segment 
we monitor our operations for indicators of impairment 
to the extent such indicators are present  we evaluate the long lived assets for recoverability 
see further discussion in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
segment review automotive net sales of the automotive segment during fiscal totaled million  a decrease from the prior year sales level of million 
fiscal sales decreased from the sales level of million achieved in fiscal fiscal sales of aluminum accessories increased  primarily with oems  but those gains were not large enough to offset a decline in floor mat sales to oems 
relative to fiscal  sales declined  as most significantly impacted by the loss of one large aluminum accessory oem program beginning in the first quarter of fiscal this segment s sales to oems are made both directly to the oems and  to a lesser extent  indirectly through third party tier suppliers 
such sales are sensitive to the overall rate of new vehicle sales  the availability of competitive alternatives and the tier suppliers ongoing ability to maintain their relationship with the oems 
additionally  the extent of pricing flexibility associated with these sales continues to be particularly limited with certain products subject to annual price reductions 
during  direct and indirect sales to oems comprised approximately of this segment s sales compared to approximately and in and  respectively 
operating income of the automotive segment totaled million for fiscal  a decrease from the prior year total of million 
this decrease was primarily attributable to higher material costs 
the current year operating income includes a million restructuring charge related to the impairment of certain idle manufacturing equipment 
in fiscal  a million restructuring charge was recorded for the closure of the waycross  georgia floor mat facility  with additional related costs of approximately million being recorded in fiscal the segment s operating income of million represented a decrease over the prior year total of million 
notable factors affecting comparisons between these years were the effects of lower sales volume  reduced production volumes  rising material costs and the waycross restructuring charge 
material costs remain higher than year ago levels in early fiscal  but generally below peak levels of fiscal we anticipate that segment sales may benefit from the gain of a large new aluminum oem program that should increase in volume during the first half of fiscal  although the extent of related start up costs could affect the initial profitability from these sales 
liquidity and capital resources the strength of our balance sheet at june  is reflected by the presence of over million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  along with nearly million in shareholders equity and no debt 
we believe that this financial position provides us with substantial flexibility to consider business acquisitions  especially those that are complementary in function to that of our existing operations  evaluate share repurchase opportunities and otherwise meet ongoing liquidity requirements 
we maintain a revolving credit arrangement with several commercial banks totaling million 
terms of the related agreement allow for borrowings to occur at or below the us prime rate of interest 
we also have an uncommitted line of credit for short term borrowings from one bank for million 
we did not have any borrowings under either arrangement in fiscal or fiscal we believe that internally generated funds  the existing credit facilities and an ability to obtain additional financing  combined with the current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand  will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund future foreseeable capital needs 
cash flows fiscal year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
provided by operating activities     used in investing activities      used in financing activities      our cash flows for the fiscal years through are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash flow generated from operations remains the primary source of financing for our internal growth 
cash provided from operating activities in fiscal totaled million  essentially flat as compared with the prior year total of million and a decrease from the fiscal total of million 
cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal were impacted by the higher level of net income  as offset by relative changes in certain working capital components  including accounts receivable and inventory 
contributing to the decline in fiscal cash flows compared to that of was the lower level of net income between years  as affected by reduced cdsoa receipts 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal included capital expenditures totaling million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital spending allocations during fiscal by segment were to specialty foods  to glassware and candles and to automotive 
construction has begun on our new salad dressing facility in kentucky 
expenditures in fiscal included approximately million for the expansion of a frozen roll manufacturing facility of the specialty foods segment 
based on current plans and expectations  we believe total capital expenditures for fiscal could exceed million due to increased construction activity on our new salad dressing facility  which is not expected to be completed until early fiscal during fiscal  we acquired a food related business for a final purchase price of approximately million 
a net asset adjustment of  was paid in october see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  a payment of million was made as required under the terms of a contingent payment arrangement associated with a business acquired in fiscal no such payment was required during fiscal  the last year of the arrangement 
financing activities used net cash totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash utilized for share repurchases totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our board of directors approved share repurchase authorizations of  shares may   shares august and  shares may 
approximately  shares from the august and the may authorizations remained authorized for future purchase at june  on march   pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program  we purchased  shares of common stock from the estate of dorothy b 
fox the estate at a price per share of  which is equal to the average closing price of our common stock over the ten trading days beginning february   as adjusted to reflect the effects of our previously declared dividend 
robert l 
fox  one of our directors  serves as executor of the estate 
total dividend payments for were million  which was nearly greater than the total of million 
this increase reflects the higher dividend payout rate of 
per share present during as compared to 
per share during and 
per share in fiscal marks the nd consecutive year in which our dividend rate was increased 
the future levels of share repurchases and declared dividends are subject to the periodic review of our board of directors and are generally determined after an assessment is made of such factors as anticipated earnings levels  cash flow requirements and general business conditions 
in connection with the preparation of this report and as reported in the form q for the period ended march   we concluded that it was appropriate to classify our investments in auction rate securities and variable rate demand obligations as short term investments 
prior to march   such investments had been classified as cash and cash equivalents 
accordingly  we have revised the classification to report these securities as short term investments in a separate line item in the current assets section on our consolidated balance sheets as of june  and we have also made corresponding adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods ended june   and to reflect the gross purchases and sales of these securities as investing activities rather than as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
we also made a reclassification on the consolidated statements of cash flows for june   and to move payments to pension plans from the investing cash flow category to the operating cash flow category  as these payments ultimately represent payments to employees  which appear more appropriately presented as activity associated with operating cash flows 
approximately million  million and million were reclassified for june   and  respectively 
our ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws  rules and regulations as may be issued and enforced by various federal  state and local agencies 
with respect to environmental matters  costs are incurred pertaining to regulatory compliance and  upon occasion  remediation 
such costs have not been  and are not anticipated to become  material 
we are contingently liable with respect to lawsuits  taxes and various other matters that routinely arise in the normal course of business 
except as discussed above  we do not have any related party transactions that materially affect our results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures 
we have various contractual obligations  which are appropriately recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
certain other items  such as purchase obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of items not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of june  and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of june  in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations     purchase obligations    minimum required pension contributions other long term liabilities as reflected on consolidated balance sheet   total      operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
purchase obligations represent purchase orders and longer term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients  supplies  raw materials  and property  plant and equipment 
this amount does not include million of other noncurrent liabilities recorded on the balance sheet  which consist of the minimum pension liability  other post employment benefit obligations  and deferred compensation and interest on deferred compensation 
these items are excluded  as it is not certain when these liabilities will become due 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
our contractual obligations have increased over the prior year due primarily to a new purchase obligation associated with the construction of a new salad dressing facility in kentucky 
as of june   it is estimated that approximately million is yet to be paid under this obligation 
impact of inflation other than for food commodities  our raw material costs during fiscal were generally above fiscal levels  which had also increased from costs present during among raw materials most affected by these increases were certain metals and petroleum derived materials 
material cost increases especially affected the results of the automotive segment 
food commodity costs  particularly for soybean oil and dairy related products  were somewhat lower than levels  which had risen from those of as we begin fiscal  many food commodity costs remain below year ago levels  although other raw material and energy related costs generally exceed those of a year ago 
we generally attempt to adjust our selling prices to offset the effects of increased raw material costs 
however  these adjustments have historically been difficult to implement 
if implemented  such adjustments tend to lag the increase in costs incurred 
minimizing the exposure to such increased costs is our diversity of operations and our ongoing efforts to achieve greater manufacturing and distribution efficiencies through the improvement of work processes 
critical accounting policies and estimates md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  inventories  marketing and distribution costs  asset impairments and self insurance reserves 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  the aggregate differences  if any  between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
while a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in part ii  item of this form k  we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize net sales and related cost of sales at the time of shipment of the products  or at the time when all substantial risks of ownership change  if later 
net sales are recorded net of estimated sales discounts  returns and certain sales incentives  including coupons and rebates 
receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts receivable balances and historical write off experience and on going reviews of our trade receivables 
measurement of potential losses requires credit review of existing customer relationships  consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the economic health of customers 
in addition to credit concerns  we also evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for customer deductions considering several factors including historical losses and existing customer relationships 
long lived assets we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets by periodically considering whether or not indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine if the assets are recoverable by comparing the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows to the assets carrying amount 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
if the carrying amounts are greater  then the assets are not recoverable 
in that instance  we compare the carrying amounts to the fair value to determine the amount of the impairment to be recorded 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized 
it is evaluated annually through asset impairment assessments as appropriate 
intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal  or other means are amortized over their useful lives 
we periodically evaluate the future economic benefit of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets when events or circumstances indicate potential recoverability concerns 
this evaluation is based on consideration of expected future undiscounted cash flows and other operating factors 
carrying amounts are adjusted appropriately when determined to have been impaired 
valuation of inventory when necessary  we provide allowances to adjust the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value  including any costs to sell or dispose 
the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving  obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates about the future demand for our products 
the estimates as to future demand used in the valuation of inventory are subject to the ongoing success of our products 
a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes  consumer buying patterns or loss of shelf space to competitors could significantly impact our evaluation of our excess and obsolete inventories 
the valuation during interim periods of inventories determined under the lifo method of accounting requires estimations regarding the year end mix of inventory quantities and costs of product 
such estimates may differ from the actual due to such factors as changes in customer demand and production schedules 
accrued marketing and distribution various marketing programs are offered to customers to reimburse them for a portion or all of their promotional activities related to our products 
additionally  we often incur various costs associated with shipping products to the customer 
we provide accruals for the costs of marketing and distribution based on historical information as may be modified by estimates of actual costs incurred 
actual costs may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the customers programs  changes in customer utilization practices  or other conditions differ from expectations 
accruals for self insurance self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with employee health care  workers compensation and general liability insurance 
these accruals include estimates that may be based on historical loss development factors 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
accounting for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to determine our ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans  we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works 
to record the related net assets and obligation of such benefit plans  we use assumptions related to inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
to determine the discount rate  we  along with our third party actuaries  considered several factors  including the june  rates of various bond indices  such as the moody s aa long term bond index and the past history of discount rates used for the plan valuation 
these assumptions follow the guidance provided in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
we  along with our third party actuaries  review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on pension expense and related funding requirements 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

 accounting for income taxes  and the new tax deduction on qualified production activities created by the american jobs creation act of the effective date of the new deduction is for tax years beginning after december  thus  the deduction is available to us in fiscal we are currently evaluating the effect the new deduction will have on our results of operations for the year ending june  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost of the employee services is recognized as compensation expense over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award  which is typically the vesting period 
sfas r is effective july  and may be adopted using a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
we are currently evaluating the statement s alternatives  but anticipate using the modified prospective application method of adoption 
our evaluation will be complete with our adoption of the statement in the first quarter of fiscal in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
apb opinion no 
is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling cost  and wasted material spoilage 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the implications of this statement  but do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

these financial instruments may be subject to interest rate risk through lost income should interest rates increase during their limited term to maturity or resetting of interest rates 
as of june   there was no long term debt outstanding 
future borrowings  if any  would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to interest rate risk 
we do not believe that a hypothetical adverse change of in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial position
