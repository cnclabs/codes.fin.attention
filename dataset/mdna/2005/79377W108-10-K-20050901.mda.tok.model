on may   the company announced that the initial investigation concluded that markdown allowances had been improperly collected from vendors during the through fiscal periods 
on june   the company disclosed that the audit committee had begun a supplemental inquiry the supplemental inquiry into the timing of the recording of inventory markdowns and vendor markdown allowances at sfae  whether there had been any overcollections of vendor markdown allowances in any of the merchandising divisions of sfae that had not been the subject of the initial investigation  and whether there had been any inappropriate billing logistics transportation compliance chargebacks by the company to any of its merchandise vendors 
the audit committee requested company management to review the investigation s findings regarding the timing of recording of inventory markdowns and to review the timing of recording of vendor markdown allowances 
the supplemental inquiry did not find any overcollections of vendor markdown allowances in any of the merchandising divisions of sfae that had not been the subject of the initial investigation 
in addition  the supplemental inquiry did not find any fraudulent activities with respect to billing logistics transportation compliance chargebacks 
the company undertook a confirmatory process related to the initial investigation and the supplemental inquiry by conducting its own review and analysis 
the scope of the company s review and analysis was broadened to include additional fiscal periods and additional vendors within the one division at sfae where the improper collection had occurred as well as other merchandising divisions of sfae 
on august  the company announced that management s confirmatory and supplementary work was completed 
the company concluded that vendor allowances of approximately million had been improperly collected from vendors in periods from fiscal through these amounts are attributable to overcollections that resulted from falsification by merchants in one sfae merchandising division of information delivered to vendors 
no improper collection was identified in fiscal the company will pay interest at the rate of per annum to the affected vendors totaling approximately million 
in aggregate  the company expects to repay vendors a total of approximately million during fiscal

the company informed the sec of the audit committee s investigations and the sec has notified the company that it has issued a formal order of private investigation 
the company was informed that the office of the united states attorney for the southern district of new york had instituted an inquiry 
the company is fully cooperating with the sec and the office of the united states attorney 
operating leases on february   the office of the chief accountant of the sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants the sec letter regarding certain accounting principles relating to three aspects of lease accounting accounting for landlord improvement incentives to tenants tenant allowances  the recognition of rent expense when the lease term in an operating lease contains a period of free or reduced rents commonly referred to as a rent holiday  and the period of time used for the depreciation of leasehold improvements 
following the release of the sec letter  many retailers reviewed their lease accounting and announced that they would restate their results for previous periods 
likewise  the company determined that its historical methods of accounting for rent holidays  tenant improvement allowances  and determining lives used in the calculation of depreciation of leasehold improvements and straight line rent determination for certain leased properties  were not in accordance with gaap 
tenant allowances tenant improvement incentives are typically provided by landlords to pay a portion of the cost associated with constructing improvements on the leased premises 
the company historically recognized the allowance as a reduction in the capitalized amount of the leasehold improvements  thereby reducing the related depreciation 
the portion of tenant allowances in excess of the costs incurred associated with the property are considered to be the improvement incentives portion of the allowances 
gaap requires that such allowances be recorded as deferred rent and amortized as reductions to rent expense over the lease term 
the company has made restatement adjustments to record these allowances as deferred rent 

table of contents the effect of the restatement relating to the improvement incentives portion of these tenant allowances on the company s consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet accounts is as follows amounts include income tax effect increase decrease in thousands consolidated statement of income other operating expenses net income consolidated balance sheet other current assets property and equipment  net accrued expenses other long term liabilities total shareholders equity consistent with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company annually evaluates the recoverability of its property and equipment and records any impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
as tenant allowances have historically resulted in an improper reduction in the capitalized amount of leasehold improvements  the carrying value of property and equipment used in the impairment charge has been understated in certain instances 
consequently  the company has made restatement adjustments to correct for the understatement of impairment charges taken in prior periods 
the effect of the restatement relating to these impairment charges on the company s consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet accounts is as follows amounts include income tax effect increase decrease in thousands consolidated statement of income other operating expenses impairments and dispositions net income consolidated balance sheet property and equipment  net accrued expenses other long term liabilities total shareholders equity rent holiday pursuant to paragraph of financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin  accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  rent holidays in an operating lease should be recognized by the lessee on a straight line basis over the lease term including any rent holiday period unless another systematic and rational allocation is more representative of the time pattern in which leased property is physically employed 
the period from when leased property is made available to the company for the construction of a new store and when the lease payments begin is a rent holiday 
since the company did not previously recognize rent expense during the rent holiday period  the company was understating rent expense during the construction period  and overstating rent during subsequent periods 
the company has made restatement adjustments to recognize straight line rent expense beginning on the date that the company took possession of the leased land or premises 

table of contents the effect of the restatement relating to rent holidays on the company s consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet accounts is as follows amounts include income tax effect increase decrease in thousands consolidated statement of income other operating expenses net income consolidated balance sheet accrued expenses other long term liabilities total shareholders equity symmetry of lease terms leasehold improvements are required to be depreciated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the time pattern of the user s benefit 
in the case of certain leases with renewal options  the company is permitted to include the renewal option period in the lease term for purposes of the depreciation analysis if renewal is reasonably assured as contemplated in sfas no 
 accounting for leases  fas 
in some cases  the company historically recognized depreciation expense for leasehold improvements using economic lives that exceeded the time period used for straight line rent calculations on the underlying leases  however  the company failed to include the renewal option period in its straight line rent analysis 
thus  the company was understating rent expense for the straight line effect of not including all renewal periods within the lease term as defined by fas the restated financial statements reflect the addition of renewal periods such that the lease term is symmetrical to the depreciation lives of leasehold improvements

changes in consumer confidence and fluctuations in financial markets can influence cyclical trends  particularly in the luxury sector  and can also cause secular trends in certain traditional department store trade areas 
additionally  a number of the company s stores are in tourist markets  including the flagship saks fifth avenue new york store 
in  the retail industry saw luxury retail sales outperform other retail sectors  primarily driven by an improving economy  customers trading up to the higher end retail segment  and acceleration in tourism business 
accordingly  the company realized significant sales improvement from its sfae business while the traditional department stores at sdsg achieved lesser improvement 
on a consolidated basis  net sales increased  while comparable store sales increased 
the comparable store sales increase was comprised of a increase at sdsg and a increase at sfae 
the consolidated gross margin rate was essentially flat  while operating expenses increased due to the increase in sales and investments in key strategic and organizational initiatives  principally at sfae 
after factoring charges associated with increased current year store rationalization activity  operating income declined million to million in from million in 
table of contents as a result of the decline in operating income  consolidated diluted earnings declined from million or per share in to million or per share in the majority of the earnings decline was attributable to increased current year charges associated with real estate rationalization initiatives 
the current year included net charges of million  net of taxes  or per share  primarily related to store closings principally at sfae  partially offset by a tax credit 
the prior year included net charges of million  net of taxes  or per share  largely related to store closings  organizational changes at sfae and a loss on debt extinguishment  offset by a tax credit and a gain on the sale of the credit card portfolio 
a summary of the and charges gains are outlined below year ended january  january  sfae store closings impairments and dispositions gross margin markdowns sg a principally severance sdsg north carolina store closings impairments and dispositions gross margin markdowns other impairments and dispositions reorganization charges and other items sg a sale of credit card portfolio other income expense loss on fao investment other income expense loss on debt extinguishment income taxes income tax effect of above items change in income tax reserves net  after tax gains and charges cash non cash summary of charges and gains cash gains and charges non cash gains and charges income tax effect net  after tax gains and charges at sdsg  the improvement in comparable store sales was the result of increased store traffic and the continued delivery of quality customer shopping experiences in a very competitive retail sector 
operating income at sdsg  however  declined by to million in while the gross margin rate was relatively flat year over year  the profitability was negatively affected by merchandising execution issues and private brand operations 
additionally  sdsg incurred nearly million in incremental expenses related to supply chain management initiatives 
sfae experienced significant growth during as evidenced by the comparable store sales increase 
the improvement in sales resulted in a increase in operating income to million at sfae  and the gross margin rate at sfae improved slightly from 
table of contents the company also took several actions during intended to further improve its financial position and strengthen its balance sheet 
specifically  the company repurchased million shares of common stock for approximately million there were approximately million shares remaining under the authorization at year end  issued million of convertible debt with an equity call spread transaction  and retired approximately million of senior notes at maturity 
the company ended with approximately million of cash and no borrowings on its million revolving credit facility which matures in the retail environment is challenging and competitive 
uncertain conditions make the forecasting of near term results difficult 
the company believes that execution of key strategic initiatives  as well as its expectations for long term growth in the luxury retail market  will provide the company an opportunity to create shareholder value 
as previously discussed  the company consummated a transaction with belk whereby belk acquired substantially all of the assets directly involved in the company s proffitt s and mcrae s business operations 
additionally  the company announced that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its northern department store division as a single business operation operating under the nameplates of bergner s  boston store  carson pirie scott  herberger s and younkers  as well as its club libby lu specialty store business 
the strategic alternatives could include the sale of the northern department store division and or club libby lu 
as the company incurs such transactions  its operations and earnings will reflect the removal of these businesses and accordingly will be more dependent on the luxury sector and the sfae operations 
the company believes that an understanding of its reported financial condition and results of operations is not complete without considering the effect of all other components of md a included herein

table of contents in a competitive traditional department store environment  a comparable store sales increase at sdsg resulted in a million improvement in gross margin 
an increase in operating expenses of million was caused by higher selling expenses associated with the sales increase  a reduction in year over year property tax refunds and spending related to investments in supply chain management initiatives 
the net effect of new and closed stores reduced operating income at sdsg by approximately million 
consistent with the aforementioned trends in the luxury sector  sfae realized a comparable store sales increase of in  which contributed to a million improvement in gross margin 
an increase of million in operating expenses at sfae reflected the increase in selling payroll and advertising expenses to support this sales increase  in addition to incremental expenses associated with strategic store and marketing investments and certain organizational changes 
the net effect of new and closed stores contributed approximately million of operating income at sfae 
expenses and charges not allocated to the segments increased by million  due largely to a million increase in impairment and disposition costs and million in markdowns  principally resulting from announced sfae store closings 
a decrease of million in severance and other charges was primarily due to a reduction in year over year reorganization costs 
net sales the following table shows relevant sales information by segment for compared to net sales total increase total increase comp increase in millions sdsg sfae consolidated the majority of the sales increase was due to a consolidated comparable store sales increase of 
the increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to a continued improvement in the economy  principally in the luxury sector as evidenced by a comparable store sales increase at sfae 
a slowing sales trend at sdsg during the second half of the year reflected the challenging environment in the traditional department store sector and resulted in a comparable store sales increase at sdsg 
in addition to the comparable store sales increase  sales generated from new stores added million  and were offset by a decline in sales of million from the sale or closure of underproductive stores 
comparable store sales are calculated on a rolling month basis 
thus  to be included in the comparison  a store must be open for months 
the additional month is used to transition the first month impact of a new store opening 
correspondingly  closed stores are removed from the comparable store sales comparison when they begin liquidating merchandise 
expanded  remodeled  converted and re branded stores are included in the comparable store sales comparison  except for the periods in which they are closed for remodeling and renovation 
gross margin gross margin increased million in from the increase in gross margin dollars was primarily attributable to the increase in sales at sfae

the gross margin rate was relatively flat at versus  due primarily to the reduction in promotional activity at sfae  partially offset by higher markdowns at sdsg 
amounts received from vendors as partial reimbursement for markdowns in were proportionate to the amounts realized in and did not materially alter the year over year improvement in gross margin as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million  or  in over  largely due to an increase in sales support costs consisting principally of selling payroll and supplies costs  primarily at sfae  costs associated with investing in the business and streamlining the organizational structure  and a reduction in the proprietary credit card contribution as a result of the sale of the portfolio 
the net effect of new and closed stores added approximately million of additional expenses to sg a 
amounts received from vendors in conjunction with compensation programs and cooperative advertising were consistent with the related gross compensation and cooperative advertising expenditures and therefore had no impact on sg a expense  in dollars or as a percentage of net sales 
sg a as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the rate increase reflected the investment in key strategic initiatives and organizational changes  in addition to the decline in net credit contribution on the increase in net sales 
other operating expenses other operating expenses in increased by million from driven by higher percentage rent expense resulting from the sales increase  higher payroll taxes related to sales driven compensation increases and a reduction in year over year property tax refunds 
other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were in compared to in  reflecting the ability to leverage increased occupancy expenses on the increase in sales 
impairments and dispositions the company recognized net charges from impairments and dispositions of million and million in and  respectively 
current year charges were principally due to the impairment of store assets related to sfae store closings and other impairment and disposition charges in the normal course of business 
prior year losses were principally due to the impairment or closure of underproductive stores  the write off of software  and other asset dispositions 
interest expense interest expense declined to million in from million in and  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in from in the improvement was primarily the result of a reduction in interest rates resulting from fixed to floating swap agreements and the exchange of higher coupon senior notes for lower coupon senior notes in  and was partially offset by interest expense on the convertible notes 
to the extent the company utilizes operating cash flows to repurchase debt and without regard to changes in interest rates  interest expense could be reduced on a prospective basis 

table of contents loss on extinguishment of debt the loss on extinguishment of debt in of million resulted largely from a premium paid on the exchange offer of senior notes 
other income expense  net other income decreased to million in from million in due to lower interest income resulting from lower balances of invested cash

income taxes for and the effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory tax rate due to state income taxes and other items such as the change in valuation allowance against state net operating loss carryforwards  the recognition of deferred tax assets for alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and the effect of concluding tax examinations 
the increase in the effective rate in was attributable to fact that the benefit in related to the conclusion of tax examinations and the recognition of deferred tax assets for alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards was greater than the benefit in from the reduction in the valuation allowance on state related net operating loss carryforwards

table of contents credit cards prior to april  the company s proprietary credit cards were issued by national bank of the great lakes nbgl  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
receivables generated from the sale of merchandise on these credit cards were sold by nbgl to another wholly owned subsidiary which in turn  transferred  conveyed and assigned all its rights and interests in the receivables to a trust 
the company was responsible for administering the credit card program  including the collection and application of funds 
certificates representing undivided beneficial interests in the pool of receivables held in the trust were issued to third party investors 
proceeds were remitted by the trust to the company as consideration for its conveyance of receivables to the trust 
the company retained an interest in the trust that was subordinate to the rights of third party investors to cash flows from receivables and repayment 
the amount of receivables representing certificates sold to third party investors was accounted for as having been sold  and the subordinated interest in the trust was recorded as an asset under retained interest in accounts receivable on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
on april   the company sold its proprietary credit card portfolio  consisting of the proprietary credit card accounts owned by nbgl and the company s ownership interest in the assets of the trust to household bank sb  na now hsbc bank nevada  na  hsbc  a third party financial institution 
in connection with the sale  the company received an amount in cash equal to the difference of the sum of of the outstanding accounts receivable balances  a premium  the value of investments held in securitization accounts minus the outstanding principal balance  together with unpaid accrued interest  of specified certificates held by public investors  which certificates were assumed by hsbc at the closing 
the company used a portion of the cash received at closing to repay amounts due under the trust certificates and related obligations held at the time of the closing by bank sponsored commercial paper conduit investors  which certificates and obligations were not assumed by hsbc 
after deducting these repayment amounts and transaction expenses and after satisfying related payables  the company s net cash proceeds from the transaction were approximately million 
after allocating the cash proceeds to the sold accounts  the retained interest in the securitized receivables  and an ongoing program agreement  the company realized a gain of approximately million 
the cash proceeds allocated to the ongoing program agreement were deferred and will be reflected as a reimbursement of continuing credit card related expenses over the life of the agreement 
as part of the transaction  for a term of ten years and pursuant to a program agreement  hsbc will establish and own proprietary credit card accounts for customers of the company s operating subsidiaries  retain the benefits and risks associated with the ownership of the accounts  receive the finance charge income and incur the bad debts associated with those accounts 
during the ten year term  pursuant to a servicing agreement  the company will continue to provide key customer service functions  including new account opening  transaction authorization  billing adjustments and customer inquiries  and will receive compensation from hsbc for these services 
at the end of the ten year term  the agreement can be renewed for two two year terms 
at the end of the agreement  the company has the right to repurchase  at fair value  all of the accounts and outstanding accounts receivable  negotiate a new agreement with hsbc or begin issuing private label credit cards itself or through others 
the agreement allows the company to terminate the agreement early following the incurrence of certain events  the most significant of which would be hsbc s failure to pay owed amounts  bankruptcy  a change in control or a material adverse change in hsbc s ability to perform under the agreement 
the agreement also allows for hsbc to terminate the agreement if the company fails to pay owed amounts or enters bankruptcy 
should either the company or hsbc choose to terminate the agreement early  the company has the right  but not the requirement  to repurchase the credit card accounts and associated accounts receivable from hsbc at their fair value 
the company is contingently liable to pay monies to hsbc in the event of an early termination or a 
table of contents significant disposition of stores 
the contingent payment is based upon a declining portion of an amount established at the beginning of the ten year agreement and on a prorated portion of significant store closings 
the maximum contingent payment had the agreement been terminated early at january  would have been approximately million 
management believes the risk of incurring a contingent payment is remote 
capital needs the company estimates capital expenditures for will approximate to million  primarily for the construction of new stores opening in  initial construction work on stores expected to open in  store expansions and renovations  enhancements to management information systems and replacement capital expenditures 
the company anticipates that working capital requirements related to new and existing stores and capital expenditures will be funded through cash provided by operations and the revolving credit agreement 
maximum availability under the revolving credit agreement is million 
there is no debt rating trigger 
during periods in which availability under the agreement exceeds million  the company is not subject to financial covenants 
if availability under the agreement were to decrease to less than million  the company would be subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to during  weighted average borrowings and letters of credit issued under this credit agreement were million 
the highest amount of borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under the agreement during was million 
the company expects to generate adequate cash flows from operating activities combined with borrowings under its revolving credit agreement in order to sustain its current levels of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain judgments and estimates utilized in implementing these accounting policies are likewise discussed in each of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion aggregates the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under varying conditions and assumptions 
revenue recognition sales and the related gross margin are recorded at the time our customers provide a satisfactory form of payment and take ownership of the merchandise 
there are minimal accounting judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of this policy 
the company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned for a refund and reduces sales and gross margin by that amount 
however  given that approximately of merchandise sold is later returned and that the vast majority of merchandise returns are affected within a matter of days of the selling transaction  the risk of the company realizing a materially different amount for sales and gross margin than reported in the consolidated financial statements is minimal 
cost of sales and inventory valuation  excluding depreciation and amortization the company s inventory is stated at the lower of lifo cost or market using the retail method 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on the consolidated balance sheet is decreased with a charge to cost of sales contemporaneous with the lowering of the retail value of the inventory on the sales floor through the use of markdowns 
hence  earnings are negatively 
table of contents impacted as the merchandise is being devalued with markdowns prior to the sale of the merchandise 
the areas requiring significant management judgment include setting the original retail value for the merchandise held for sale  recognizing merchandise for which the customer s perception of value has declined and appropriately marking the retail value of the merchandise down to the perceived value  and estimating the shrinkage that has occurred through theft during the period between physical inventory counts 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the averaging processes within the retail method  can  under certain circumstances  produce varying financial results 
factors that can lead to different financial results include setting original retail values for merchandise held for sale at too high a level  failure to identify a decline in perceived value of inventories and process the appropriate retail value markdowns and overly optimistic or overly conservative shrinkage estimates 
the company believes it has the appropriate merchandise valuation and pricing controls in place to minimize the risk that its inventory values would be materially under or overvalued 
the company receives vendor provided support in different forms 
when the vendor provides support for inventory markdowns  the company records the support as a reduction to cost of sales 
such support is recorded in the period that the corresponding markdowns are taken 
when the company receives inventory related support that is not designated for markdowns  the company includes this support as a reduction in cost purchases 
credit card income and expenses following the sale of the company s proprietary credit card business in april  the company no longer maintains a retained interest in the credit card receivables 
there are minimal accounting judgments and uncertainties affecting the accounting for the credit card program compensation  credit card servicing compensation and servicing expenses 
initial proceeds allocated to the program and servicing agreement are being amortized into income ratably over the lives of the agreement 
ongoing income associated with honoring the credit cards under the program agreement  promoting the credit cards and servicing the credit cards is recognized monthly contemporaneous with providing these services 
prior to the sale  the carrying value of the company s retained interest in credit card receivables required a substantial amount of management judgment and estimates 
at the time credit card receivables were sold to third party investors through the securitization program  generally accepted accounting principles required that the company recognize a gain or loss equal to the excess of the estimated fair value of the consideration to be received from the individual interest sold over the cost of the receivables sold 
as the receivables were collected  the estimated gains and losses were reconciled to the actual gains and losses 
given that the company generated credit card receivables of approximately billion per year and average outstanding sold receivables were generally billion to billion  a substantial majority of the annual estimated credit gains and losses had been reconciled to actual gains and losses 
only that portion of the gains and losses attributable to the outstanding securitized portfolio at year end remained subject to estimating risk 
determining the fair value of the consideration to be received from the individual interest sold included estimates of the following amounts associated with the sold portfolio the gross finance charge income to be generated by the portfolio which required estimates of payment rates  the coupon interest rate due to the third party investors  bad debts  cost of servicing the portfolio  and assumed cash flow discount rates 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements reflect the critical estimates and assumptions utilized 
items that were considered in making judgments and preparing estimates and factors that can lead to variations in the consolidated financial results were as follows finance charge income was billed at a contractual rate monthly and warranted little judgment or estimates 
the expected credit card customer payment rate was based on historical payment rates 
table of contents weighted to recent payment rate trends 
to the extent credit card customers paid off their balances sooner than estimated  this net gain was reduced 
conversely  if the credit card customers paid off balances over a longer period of time  the net gain was increased 
the future coupon interest rate due to the third party investors was estimated using the fixed interest rates in place and estimated floating interest rates over the estimated life of the portfolio 
to the extent floating interest rates increased beyond the increase imbedded in the estimates  the net gain was reduced 
to the extent floating interest rates did not increase to the level embedded in the estimates  the net gain was increased 
bad debts expected from the sold portfolio were based on historical write off rates  weighted to recent write off trends and increased or decreased to reflect management s outlook for trends to develop over the next to months 
to the extent there were positive or negative factors on the credit card customers ability or intent to pay off the outstanding balance eg unemployment rates  level of consumer debt or bankruptcy legislation  the actual bad debt to be realized could have exceeded or been less than the amount estimated 
bad debts in excess of those embedded in the estimates reduced the net gain 
conversely  bad debts less than those embedded increased the net gain 
delinquent accounts were written off automatically after the passage of seven months without receiving a monthly payment equal to of the minimum contractual payment 
minimum monthly contractual payments ranged from to 
accounts were written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy  customer death or fraud 
the cost of servicing the portfolio was estimated using our historical operating costs 
this estimate was subject to minimal risk of deviation 
the assumed cash flow discount rates were based on the weighted average cost of debt and were subject to typical interest rate volatility in the debt markets 
the most sensitive assumptions in calculating the gain on sold receivables were the credit card customers payment rate  the estimate for bad debts and the assumed cash flow discount rates 
the following table represents the company s assumptions in measuring the fair value of retained interests in accounts receivable in weighted average interest rates applied to credit card balances weighted average payment rate credit losses expected from the principal amount of receivables sold weighted average cost of funding self insurance reserves the company self insures a substantial portion of the exposure for costs related primarily to employee medical  workers compensation and general liability 
expenses are recorded based on estimates for reported and incurred but not reported claims considering a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  litigation costs  inflation and other assumptions 
although the company does not expect the amount it will ultimately pay to differ significantly from estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and assumptions 

table of contents depreciation and recoverability of capital assets over one half of the company s assets at january  are represented by investments in property  equipment and goodwill 
determining appropriate depreciable lives and reasonable assumptions for use in evaluating the carrying value of capital assets requires judgments and estimates 
the company utilizes the straight line depreciation method and a variety of depreciable lives 
land is not depreciated 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years 
store fixtures are depreciated over years 
equipment utilized in stores eg  escalators and in support areas eg  distribution centers  technology and fixtures in support areas are depreciated over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or their related lease terms  generally ranging from to years 
internally generated computer software is amortized over to years 
generally  no estimated salvage value at the end of the useful life of the assets is considered 
when constructing stores  the company receives allowances from landlords 
the portion of those allowances attributable to the property owned by the landlord is considered a reduction in the capital expenditures related to that store 
allowances in excess of the amounts attributable to the property owned by the landlord are considered improvement allowances and are recorded as deferred rent liabilities that are amortized over the life of the lease 
capital expenditures are also reduced when the company receives cash and allowances from merchandise vendors to fund the construction of vendor shops 
to the extent the company remodels or otherwise replaces or disposes of property and equipment prior to the end of their assigned depreciable lives  the company could realize a loss or gain on the disposition 
to the extent assets continue to be used beyond their assigned depreciable lives  no depreciation expense is being realized 
the company reassesses the depreciable lives in an effort to reduce the risk of significant losses or gains at disposition and utilization of assets with no depreciation charges 
the reassessment of depreciable lives involves utilizing historical remodel and disposition activity and forward looking capital expenditure plans 
recoverability of the carrying value of store assets is assessed upon the occurrence of certain events eg  opening a new store near an existing store or announcing plans for a store closing and  absent certain events  annually 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates for future store generated cash flows 
the underlying estimates for cash flows include estimates for future sales  gross margin rates  inflation and store expenses 
during  the company recorded million in impairment charges in the normal course of business primarily associated with stores in which the estimated discounted cash flows would not recover the carrying value of the store assets 
in addition  sfae recorded an additional million in impairment and disposition charges associated with store closings 
there are other stores in which current cash flows are not adequate to recover the carrying value of the store assets 
however  the company believes that estimated sales growth and gross margin improvement will enhance the cash flows of these stores such that the carrying value of the store assets will be recovered 
generally these stores were recently opened and require a two to five year period to develop the customer base to attain the required cash flows 
to the extent management s estimates for sales growth and gross margin improvement are not realized  future annual assessments could result in impairment charges 
leases the company leases stores  distribution centers  and administrative facilities under operating leases 
store lease agreements generally include rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and contingent rent provisions for percentage of sales in excess of specified levels 
most of the company s lease agreements include renewal 
table of contents periods at the company s option 
the company recognizes rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis over the lease term beginning with the date the company takes possession of the leased space and includes such rent expense in store pre opening costs 
the company records tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays as deferred rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred rent over the terms of the lease to rent expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the company records rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for contingent percentage of sales lease provisions when the company determines that it is probable that the specified levels will be reached during the fiscal year 
income and other taxes the majority of the company s deferred tax assets at january  consist of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that will expire between and during the valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards was reduced based on projections of future profitability which include a gain related to the sale of the proffitts business in in addition  the company re analyzed certain net operating loss and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards attributable to the period when carson reorganized under the bankruptcy code  prior to saks acquisition of carson 
this analysis resulted in an additional reduction to the valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards and the recognition of a deferred tax asset for additional alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
these items were credited to shareholder s equity in accordance with statement of position no 
sop  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code 
the company is routinely under audit by federal  state and local authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes 
these audits include questioning the timing and amount of deductions  the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal  state and local tax laws 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company often accrues charges for exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
during  the company recorded a benefit of million related to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to certain tax examination periods which was recorded as a credit to shareholder s equity in accordance with sop in addition  an increase to the reserve for tax exposures of million was recorded as an income tax expense for additional exposures 
during  the company concluded a federal income tax examination for the and tax years on terms favorable to previously accrued exposures associated with those tax years 
accordingly  the company decreased the amount previously accrued for exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
additionally  the company identified exposures related to state tax filing positions and determined the need to provide for additional reserves 
the net effect of this federal and state reserve adjustment resulted in an income tax benefit of million and a credit to shareholders equity of million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk primarily arises from changes in interest rates and the us equity and bond markets 
the effects of changes in interest rates on earnings generally have been small relative to other factors that also affect earnings  such as sales and operating margins 
the company seeks to manage exposure to adverse interest rate changes through its normal operating and financing activities  and if appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
such derivative instruments can be used as part of an overall risk management program in order to manage the costs and risks associated with various financial exposures 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes  as clearly defined in its risk management policies 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowings  and derivative financial instrument activities  which are described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k

during the company terminated all remaining interest rate swap agreements resulting in net losses 
when combined with net gains from other previously cancelled interest rate swap agreements  the company had total unamortized net losses gains of thousand and million at january  and january   respectively  that are being amortized as a component of interest expense through based on the company s market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at january   the company has determined that there was no material market risk exposure to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as of such date 
the company s assumptions in measuring the retained interests in accounts receivable as of and for the period ended february  and the sensitivity of the fair value to immediate and adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows assumption fair value impact of adverse change fair value impact of adverse change weighted average interest rates applied to credit card balances weighted average payment rate credit losses expected from the february  principal amount of receivables sold weighted average cost of funding 
table of contents these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
the effect of an adverse change in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another  which might alter the reported sensitivities
