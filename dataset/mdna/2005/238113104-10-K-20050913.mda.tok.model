item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview datascope corp 
is a diversified medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets proprietary products for clinical health care markets in interventional cardiology and radiology  cardiovascular and vascular surgery  anesthesiology  emergency medicine and critical care 
we have four product lines that are aggregated into two reportable segments  cardiac assist monitoring products and interventional products vascular grafts 
the cardiac assist monitoring products segment accounts for of total sales 
our products are sold worldwide by direct sales representatives and independent distributors 
our largest geographic markets are the united states  europe and japan 
we believe that customers  primarily hospitals and other medical institutions  choose among competing products on the basis of product performance  features  price and service 
in general  we believe price has become an important factor in hospital purchasing decisions because of pressure to cut costs 
these pressures on hospitals result from federal and state regulations that limit reimbursement for services provided to medicare and medicaid patients 
there are also cost containment pressures on healthcare systems outside the us  particularly in certain european countries 
many companies  some of which are substantially larger than us  are engaged in manufacturing competing products 
our products are generally not affected by economic cycles 
our sales growth depends in part upon the successful development and marketing of new products 
we have continued our emphasis on new product development and have increased our investment in research and development r d 
in fiscal we spent million on r d  an increase of million or from fiscal we expect to increase r d spending in fiscal as compared to we also plan to increase sales through selective acquisitions of products and technologies from other companies 
during the past two years we have made investments in several new technologies  including the prolumen tm thrombectomy device and the x site r vascular closure device 
we are committed to improving our operating margins through increasing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and cost containment programs 
datascope s financial position continued strong at the end of fiscal  with cash and short and long term marketable investments at million compared to million at june  results of operations financial summary the following table shows the comparison of net earnings and earnings per diluted share over the past three fiscal years 
dollars in millions  except eps year ended june  net earnings earnings per share  diluted the decrease in net earnings and diluted earnings per share in fiscal compared to fiscal was caused principally by special charges of million after tax or per share  a one time income tax expense of million or per share related to repatriation of approximately million of foreign earnings  the continued decline in sales of vascular closure devices and lower earnings of the patient monitoring division 
net earnings and earnings per share in fiscal year includes the gain on legal settlement of million after tax or per diluted share 
comparison of results fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales sales the following table shows sales by product line over the past three fiscal years 
sales by product line dollars in millions year ended june  patient monitoring change from prior year of total sales cardiac assist change from prior year of total sales interventional products change from prior year of total sales vascular grafts change from prior year of total sales genisphere change from prior year of total sales total sales change from prior year sales in fiscal of million increased million or compared to million in fiscal sales increased in all product lines except interventional products 
favorable foreign exchange translation contributed million to the sales increase as a result of the weakness of the united states us dollar relative to the euro and the british pound  the currencies in countries in which we have direct sales subsidiaries 
sales in the us of million  decreased million or attributable to the continued decline in sales of vascular closure devices and lower sales of patient monitoring products 
sales in international markets of million increased million or excluding favorable foreign exchange translation of million due to increases in all businesses  except interventional products 
sales of the cardiac assist monitoring products segment in fiscal increased to million from million last year 
patient monitoring sales of patient monitoring products in fiscal increased to million due primarily to increased sales in international markets and favorable foreign exchange translation of million 
a delay in shipping panorama tm monitoring network systems in the fourth quarter resulted in slightly lower us sales for the year 
in the fourth quarter  the number of panorama orders requiring delivery in future quarters was greater than expected 
also  a hiatus in installations during the fourth quarter of fiscal to resolve product issues increased the backlog of installations and temporarily moved commitments to start installations from days to days  delaying certain shipments accordingly 
the product issues were resolved in early june cardiac assist sales of cardiac assist products increased to million due to continued strong worldwide unit sales of the company s cs r balloon pump  continued higher unit sales of intra aortic balloons in international markets and favorable foreign exchange translation of million 
sales in the us of million increased million or  and sales in international markets of million increased million or excluding foreign exchange translation 
in january  we broadened and strengthened the intra aortic balloon product line when we introduced the linear tm fr 
intra aortic balloon iab 
the linear fr 
has the smallest diameter of any iab catheter 
reducing iab diameter is highly desirable because it allows more blood flow around the catheter thereby enabling clinicians to deliver counterpulsation therapy even to patients with smaller peripheral arteries 
the linear also features a new balloon membrane that is the most abrasion resistant of any iab 
sales of the interventional products vascular grafts segment decreased to million compared to million last year 
interventional products sales of interventional products were million  below last year as sales of vasoseal r  vascular sealing devices  decreased to million  partially offset by increased sales of new interventional products  safeguard tm and prolumen 
we expect to turn around the sales performance of interventional products by introducing two new vascular closure devices x site and on site tm  and by the growing contributions of new interventional products that now include the safeguard hemostasis management device  the prolumen thrombectomy device and the proguide tm chronic dialysis catheter 
those innovative products which have already been introduced or are scheduled for introduction in the first half of fiscal will  if successful  lead to improved margins and earnings in the second half of fiscal x site is a vascular closure device aimed at an estimated million suture based market segment for closing the arterial wound after a catheterization procedure 
x site has fda approval and is currently in use at beta sites 
we believe that the testing at beta sites is demonstrating that x site has advantages over the competitive device 
a limited market launch is planned for september  followed by a full launch in october on site is a collagen based vascular closure device aimed at first stabilizing and then growing sales to existing vasoseal accounts 
on site retains the extravascular advantage of vasoseal but eliminates the need for a second operator and provides for wire guided delivery of the collagen plug to seal the arterial wound 
on site received fda approval in late may market launch is planned for early calendar the proguide chronic dialysis catheter  launched in may  is the latest of four new interventional products introduced over the past years 
proguide enters a worldwide market estimated at million annually 
chronic dialysis catheters connect a patient with end stage renal disease to a dialysis machine and allow for needle free access for the dialysis procedure 
by using a guide wire and eliminating the peel away sheath required by competitive catheters  the proguide provides easier insertion and makes the procedure more convenient according to early users 
vascular grafts sales of intervascular  inc s products were million  above last year  as a result of higher sales in the us following the appointment of gore as intervascular s exclusive us distributor effective may   increased shipments to japan and favorable foreign exchange translation of million 
sales to gore in the fourth quarter included million for an initial stocking order 
sales in the us increased million or and sales in international markets increased million or excluding foreign exchange translation 
genisphere sales of genisphere products were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  as genisphere continued to pursue its marketing strategy  to target major academic institutions and the research and development department of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
costs and expenses gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit increased million or as a result of increased sales in all businesses except interventional products 
the gross profit percentage was for fiscal compared to last year  with the decrease of percentage points primarily due to a less favorable sales mix  as a result of reduced sales of higher margin interventional products and inventory write offs for excess and obsolete inventories  primarily in the interventional products and patient monitoring divisions 
research and development r d we continued our companywide focus on new product development and improvements of existing products in fiscal spending on research and development reflects investment in new product development programs  sustaining r d on existing products  regulatory compliance and clinical evaluations 
total r d expenses increased to million in fiscal  equivalent to of sales compared to million  or of sales last year 
r d expenses for the cardiac assist monitoring products segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million last year  with the increase primarily due to expenses related to recently introduced products including the linear fr  intra aortic balloon in cardiac assist  and the panorama  central monitoring network in patient monitoring  as well as new product development projects 
r d expenses for the interventional products vascular grafts segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million last year  with the increase primarily due to expenses related to recently introduced products such as the safeguard and proguide and new product development projects  including the x site and on site vascular closure devices 
the balance of consolidated r d is in corporate and other and amounted to million in fiscal compared to million for the comparable period last year 
selling  general and administrative sg a total selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  or of sales compared to million  or of sales last year 
sg a expenses for the cardiac assist monitoring products segment increased to million in fiscal  primarily attributable to additions to the field force and filling open field positions  costs associated with the increased sales and unfavorable foreign exchange translation million 
sg a expenses for the interventional products vascular grafts segment in fiscal decreased to million attributable to the sales force reduction in interventional products and the termination of intervascular s direct sales force upon the appointment of gore as intervascular s exclusive us distributor effective may  segment sg a expenses include fixed corporate g a charges that are offset in corporate and other 
the weaker us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound increased total sg a expenses by approximately million in fiscal special charges in fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million 
these charges related to the following o termination of certain r d projects totaling million 
based upon recently completed extensive reviews of the current and future market  clinical benefits  cost to manufacture  price realization and the development and regulatory costs required for a successful market launch  certain r d projects were terminated 
as a result of the decision to terminate the projects we wrote off licenses and purchased technology of million and tooling and other assets of million 
the licenses  purchased technology and tooling were determined to be fully impaired at june  because they have no alternative future use 
contractual obligations for non cancelable purchase orders and settlement costs related to the r d projects of million were also recorded 
o write off of investments in two private medical technology companies of million 
in conjunction with the decision to terminate certain r d projects as noted above  we recorded an impairment of our investment in the common and preferred stock of a private medical technology company  totaling million 
the investment in the common stock of this company was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
we determined that there was an other than temporary decline in the value of this investment and adjusted the carrying value of the investment to zero 
we recorded an impairment of million for an investment in the preferred stock of a second private medical technology company based on information received from that company that the performance of their lead product in clinical trials was significantly below target and affected their ability to raise funds 
we determined that there was an other than temporary decline in the value of this investment and adjusted the carrying value of the investment to zero 
o severance expenses of million for workforce reductions related to a companywide cost reduction program 
as a result of a companywide cost reduction program that was approved by management  we recorded severance expenses of million for the termination of employees of the workforce 
the reductions were in manufacturing  r d and sg a 
thirteen of the headcount reductions were achieved through attrition 
substantially all of the terminated employees left the company by june  the severance payments will be completed by the end of fiscal year the special charges are reflected in the following segments interventional products vascular grafts million  corporate and other million 
interest income interest income was million in fiscal compared to million last year  with the increase due primarily to an increase in the average interest rate yield to from  partially offset by a lower average portfolio balance million vs 
million 
income taxes in fiscal  the consolidated effective tax rate was compared to last year 
the lower tax rate in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at lower effective rates  reduced earnings in the us and a greater benefit for the federal research credit  partially offset by a one time additional tax expense of million for repatriation of foreign earnings 
on october   the working families tax relief act of wftra was enacted 
the wftra includes a july  retroactive reinstatement of the federal research credit  which is now scheduled to expire on december  on october   the american jobs creation act of ajca was enacted 
under ajca  the extraterritorial income exclusion eie is being phased out over a two year period 
our effective tax rate for fiscal includes the net benefit of the reinstatement of the research credit and the initial phase out of the eie 
the ajca also provides a temporary dividends received deduction for certain cash dividends repatriated from our international operations 
the amount of dividends eligible for repatriation is subject to several limitations  and requires that the proceeds be invested in the us pursuant to an approved domestic reinvestment plan 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the board of directors authorized the repatriation of million of foreign earnings and a tax provision of approximately million related to the repatriation was recorded 
net earnings net earnings were million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share in fiscal net earnings in fiscal included special charges of million after tax or per diluted share and a one time income tax expense of million or per diluted share related to repatriation of foreign earnings 
net earnings were below fiscal  principally due to the items noted above  the continued decline in sales of vascular closure devices and lower earnings in the patient monitoring division  as a result of the panorama shipment delay in the fourth quarter 
stock based compensation we awarded fully vested  nonqualified stock options to eligible employees as part of our annual stock option award  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year due to the immediate vesting provisions  this one time award resulted in increased pro forma compensation expense for the fiscal year ended june  on may   the board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of all stock options outstanding under the company s amended and restated stock option plan that had exercise prices per share higher than  the average of the high and low sales price of our stock on may  options to purchase approximately thousand shares of our common stock became exercisable immediately  subject to an exercise price threshold requirement 
the purpose of the accelerated vesting of existing stock option grants and the immediate vesting provision of the fiscal year stock option grant was to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our consolidated statement of earnings with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and will require that compensation expense associated with stock options be recognized in the statement of earnings  rather than as a footnote disclosure in our consolidated financial statements 
the acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge to our historical financial statements 
foreign currency due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize net earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions which are primarily related to certain intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging activities do not subject us to exchange rate risk because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the intercompany receivables hedged 
the net gains or losses on these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are included within other  net  in our consolidated statement of earnings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as of june   we had a notional amount of million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  all of which were in euros and british pounds 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed months and require us to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity  at rates agreed to when the contract is signed 
comparison of results fiscal vs 
fiscal sales sales of the cardiac assist monitoring products segment in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal patient monitoring patient monitoring sales in fiscal rose to million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in sales was primarily attributable to higher sales of bedside monitors  including the recently introduced spectrum r and trio tm monitors  increased sales of masimo set r pulse oximetry sensors and favorable foreign exchange translation of million 
sales of central monitoring systems decreased in fiscal because of the introduction of our new panorama central monitoring system 
during the fourth quarter  many customers placed substantial new orders for panorama  or replaced existing orders for the older patientnet central system with orders for panorama 
only a small number of panorama units were shipped in the fourth quarter  consistent with our policy of limiting new central monitoring system shipments in the first period after product release 
the panorama patient monitoring network is our new platform for centralized monitoring of vital signs information 
the panorama is an integrated family of patient monitoring products that will enable hospitals to seamlessly share information on all patients via one network 
its user interface will be integrated with our passport r and spectrum monitors 
this will simplify user training  will enable the capture and storage of all data including continuous lead ecg acquisition  and will provide for control of bedside alarms 
additionally  the central station will store all waveform and numeric vital signs gathered by the monitors  creating a continuous electronic patient record 
panorama will also include a compact ambulatory telemetry transmitter  the panorama telepack  and an instrument transmitter  the panorama instrument radio  to wirelessly communicate patient data to and from the panorama central station 
panorama replaces a previous system purchased by us on an oem basis and sold by the patient monitoring division 
cardiac assist cardiac assist sales in fiscal increased to million from million in the prior year  due to continued higher sales of intra aortic balloon iab catheters and pumps  and favorable foreign exchange translation of million 
shipments of the premium priced fidelity r fr 
iab catheter continued to increase  accounting for of total iab catheter sales in the fourth quarter 
increased purchases of iab s by our japanese distributor and higher shipments to other international markets also contributed to increased iab sales 
higher pump sales reflect continued strong demand for the new cs intra aortic balloon pump  our first fully automatic pump  launched globally in september sales of the interventional products vascular grafts segment decreased to million compared to million in fiscal interventional products sales of interventional products decreased to million from million in the prior year as sales of vasoseal vascular closure devices continued to weaken  as a result of continued strong competition  and the decline was only partially offset by sales contributed by the new safeguard and prolumen products 
safeguard  a manual compression assist device designed to maintain hemostasis after arterial catheterization procedures  was launched in the second quarter 
prolumen is a new thrombectomy device designed to quickly and effectively clear blood clots from blocked dialysis access sites 
shipment of prolumen began at the end of the third quarter of fiscal aside from other new products being developed for the dialysis market  we have undertaken a number of new product initiatives with the intent of halting and reversing the decline of our vascular closure sales 
the first such initiative was announced in may when we acquired assets and technology from x site medical  llc x site 
the acquired assets include all technology related to x site s lead product  a suture based vascular closure device for achieving hemostasis after coronary catheterization procedures 
suture based devices represent over million of an estimated million annual market for vascular closure devices 
the x site product will be marketed by the interventional products division through its existing sales force  which currently sells other vascular closure devices 
masimo set is a registered trademark of masimo corporation 
vascular grafts sales of intervascular inc s products increased to million compared to million in the prior year  with favorable foreign exchange contributing million to this year s results 
excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation  sales declined due to lower selling prices in certain european markets  lower sales in the us and reduced shipments to intervascular s distributor in japan 
in march  we resubmitted our k notification to the fda for regulatory clearance to market intergard r silver grafts in the united states 
in august  the fda requested that we provide additional data from our european postmarketing studies of the intergard silver 
genisphere sales of genisphere products were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  as genisphere continued to pursue its marketing strategy  to target major academic institutions and the research and development department of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
costs and expenses gross profit net sales less cost of sales the gross profit percentage was for fiscal compared to in fiscal  with the increase primarily due to an improved gross margin percentage in the cardiac assist monitoring products segment  as a result of cost reduction programs and sales of new products with higher margins 
partially offsetting the above was the impact from a less favorable sales mix  as a result of reduced sales of higher margin interventional products and vascular grafts 
research and development r d we continued our companywide focus on new product development and improvements of existing products in fiscal spending on research and development reflects investment in new product development programs  sustaining r d on existing products  regulatory compliance and clinical evaluations 
total r d expenses increased to million in fiscal  equivalent to of sales compared to million  or of sales in fiscal r d expenses for the cardiac assist monitoring products segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year  with the increase primarily due to expenses related to recently introduced products including the cs intra aortic balloon pump in cardiac assist and the panorama  central monitoring network in patient monitoring  as well as new product development projects

the balance of consolidated r d is in corporate and other and amounted to million in fiscal compared to million for the comparable period in fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a total selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  or of sales compared to million  or of sales in the prior year 
sg a expenses for the cardiac assist monitoring products segment increased to million in fiscal  primarily attributable to filling open field sales positions  costs associated with the increased sales and unfavorable foreign exchange translation million 
sg a expenses for the interventional products vascular grafts segment in fiscal were essentially unchanged compared to the prior year at million  as lower selling and marketing expenses in interventional products were offset by higher expenses in intervascular attributable to unfavorable foreign exchange translation 
segment sg a expenses include fixed corporate g a charges that are offset in corporate and other 
the weaker us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound increased total sg a expenses by approximately million in fiscal gain on legal settlement in july  we instituted patent infringement litigation relating to a vascular sealing method against vascular solutions  inc in the united states district court  district of minnesota 
in that litigation our complaint alleged that the manufacture  use and or sale of vascular solutions duett device infringed our united states patent no 
 in november  the parties settled the matter 
pursuant to the settlement  vascular solutions paid us million and we granted vascular solutions a limited  non exclusive patent license 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pretax gain on the settlement  net of related legal expenses  of million  or million after tax  equivalent to per diluted share 
interest income interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  with the increase primarily due to a higher average portfolio balance million vs 
million  partially offset by a decline in the average yield from to 
income taxes in fiscal  the consolidated effective tax rate was compared to in fiscal the lower tax rate in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in the extraterritorial income exclusion eie and the federal research credit 
the increase in the eie was attributable to increased profits from higher us export sales 
the higher federal research credit resulted from increased r d expenses in fiscal in fiscal  the effect on the consolidated tax rate of the gain on legal settlement was net earnings net earnings were million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share in fiscal net earnings in fiscal included a gain of million after tax or per diluted share  from the settlement of patent litigation with vascular solutions  inc the increased earnings in fiscal primarily reflects an increase in profits from higher sales  an improved gross margin in the cardiac assist monitoring products segment and a lower consolidated effective tax rate 
partially offsetting the above were reduced earnings in the interventional products vascular grafts segment 
purchased technology x site in may  we acquired certain assets and technology of x site medical  llc x site  a privately held company in the business of developing  manufacturing and marketing products for the vascular closure market 
the acquired assets include all technology related to x site s lead product  a suture based vascular closure device for achieving hemostasis after coronary catheterization procedures 
the x site purchase will broaden and enhance our existing vascular closure product line 
the purchase price was approximately million  in cash  comprised of an initial payment of million  including transaction expenses  and an accrued liability for an additional million  representing the present value of guaranteed minimum payments to be paid over the next five years 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  we may also be required to make additional contingent payments  which would be triggered by the achievement of certain milestones and sales performance levels not currently estimable 
the x site purchase was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the aggregate purchase price for x site was allocated to tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair value at date of acquisition 
there was no goodwill recorded in the transaction because the purchase price for this acquisition did not exceed the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
intangible assets acquired of million  consisting primarily of intellectual property and manufacturing know how  are being amortized over a period of approximately years based primarily on the remaining legal life of the underlying acquired technology 
an independent valuation firm was used to determine the fair market value of the intangible assets acquired 
prolumen in may  we acquired technology from rex medical  lp  for the prolumen thrombectomy device 
with the launch of the prolumen in march we entered the dialysis access market 
thrombectomy is the process of removing blood clots from blocked dialysis access sites 
thrombectomy procedures are performed primarily by interventional radiologists in the us  a current and well established sales call point for our interventional products division 
through june   we paid million in cash based on achieving certain milestones 
the technology transfer agreement also requires us to pay additional contingent payments  which would be triggered by the achievement of sales performance levels not currently estimable 
the payments made for the prolumen technology were recorded as purchased technology and will be amortized over approximately years based on the remaining legal life of the underlying technology 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at june  of million compared to million at june  and the current ratio was compared to at june  the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in cash and short term investments million  accounts receivable million and prepaid expenses and other current assets million 
partially offsetting the above was a decrease in prepaid income taxes million and an increase in current liabilities million 
the increase in cash and short term investments was primarily due to classifying million of marketable investments held in europe as short term because they will be repatriated to the us under the approved tax repatriation program in fiscal the increase in accounts receivable of million primarily reflected the increase in sales 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to an increase in other receivables 
the decrease in prepaid income taxes of million resulted from receipt of a tax refund 
the increase in current liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase in short term debt of million 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations was million compared to million last year with the decrease primarily attributable to lower earnings and an increase in accounts receivable  inventories and other current assets 
net cash used in investing activities was million  primarily attributable to sale of investments of million and million for maturities of investments  partially offset by purchases of investments of million  million for capitalized software  the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment and million for purchased technology and licenses  primarily for a license for the rights to manufacture our anestar tm anesthesia delivery systems 
net cash used in financing activities was million  due to million dividends paid  stock repurchases of million and repayments of short term borrowings of million  partially offset by stock option activity of million and short term borrowings of million 
we purchased about  shares of our common stock for approximately million during fiscal year working capital at june  was million compared to million at june  the current ratio was compared to at june  the decrease in working capital and the current ratio was primarily the result of a decrease in cash and short term investments million and accounts receivable million  and an increase in current liabilities million 
partially offsetting the above was an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets million and inventories million 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations was million compared to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in inventories and other current assets  as discussed above 
net cash used in investing activities was million  primarily attributable to purchases of investments of million  offset by million for maturities of investments  million for purchased technology and licenses  million for capitalized software and the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was million  due to million dividends paid and stock repurchases of million  offset by stock option activity of million 
purchases of technology and licenses included cash payments for the x site assets and technology of million and milestone payments to rex medical  lp for the prolumen and other devices of million 
we purchased about  shares of our common stock for approximately million during fiscal year working capital at june  was million compared to million at june  the current ratio was compared to at june  the increase in working capital and the current ratio was primarily the result of an increase in cash and short term investments million and a decrease in current liabilities million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable million and inventories million 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations was million compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to the higher net earnings  higher depreciation and amortization and a decrease in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million  attributable to purchases of investments of million  offset by million for maturities of investments  capitalized software of million  purchased technology and licenses of million and the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was million  due to million dividends paid and stock repurchases of million  offset by stock option activity of million 
we purchased about  shares of our common stock for approximately million during fiscal year we believe our financial resources are sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements 
the moderate rate of current us inflation has not significantly affected us 
the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations  primarily the euro and british pound  did not have a significant impact on our liquidity 
presented below is a summary of our contractual obligations and other commitments as of june  dollars in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase commitments contingent milestone payments short term debt total contractual obligations and other commitments these amounts include commitments for inventory and capital expenditures that do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business 
these amounts represent contingent milestone payments under various agreements  including x site and rex medical 
while it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made  we have included the estimated payments in the table based on our projection of the earliest date when the milestones or contingencies may be met 
information concerning forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of many important factors 
many of these important factors cannot be predicted or quantified and are outside our control  including the possibility that the full market launch of x site will not occur in october  that on site will not be launched in early calendar  that the introduction of two new vascular closure devices  x site and on site  and the growing contributions of new interventional products will not turn around the sales performance of interventional products  that new interventional products already introduced or scheduled for introduction in the first half of fiscal  may not be successful  and may not lead to improved margins and earnings in the second half of fiscal  and that market conditions may change  particularly as the result of competitive activity in the markets served by the company 
additional risks are the company s dependence on certain unaffiliated suppliers including single source manufacturers for patient monitoring  cardiac assist and interventional products  continued demand for the company s products generally  rapid and significant changes that characterize the medical device industry and the ability to continue to respond to such changes  the uncertain timing of regulatory approvals  as well as other risks detailed in documents filed by datascope with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an on going basis and adjust as necessary to accurately reflect current conditions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on current and historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates o revenue recognition we recognize revenue and all related costs  including warranty costs  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss passes to the customer and collectibility of the fixed sales price is probable 
for products shipped fob shipping point  revenue is recognized when they leave our premises 
for products shipped fob destination  revenue is recognized when they reach the customer 
for certain products where we maintain consigned inventory at customer locations  revenue is recognized at the time we are notified that the product has been used by the customer 
we record estimated sales returns as a reduction of net sales in the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
historical experience is used to estimate an accrual for future returns relating to recorded sales  as well as estimated warranty costs 
revenue for service repairs of equipment is recognized after service has been completed  and service contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
for certain products  revenue is recognized individually for delivered components when undelivered components  such as installation  are not essential to their functionality 
post shipment obligations for training commitments are considered perfunctory  and sales are recognized when delivered with provision for incremental costs 
o allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is used to state trade receivables at estimated net realizable value 
we rely on prior experience to estimate cash which ultimately will be collected from the gross receivables balance at period end 
such amount cannot be known with certainty at the financial statement date 
we maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that will likely not be collectible due to customer liquidity issues 
we also maintain an allowance for estimated future collection losses on existing receivables  determined based on historical trends 
o inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
inventory reserves are recorded to report inventory at its estimated fair market value 
a reserve is recorded for inventory specifically identified as slow moving or obsolete 
in addition  a reserve is recorded based upon our historical experience with inventory becoming obsolete due to age  changes in technology and other factors 
o income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess whether it will be more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that we cannot conclude that recovery is likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
at june   we had approximately million of gross deferred tax assets  including tax net operating loss carryforwards and foreign and state tax credits  a portion of which will expire from to if not utilized and the remaining portion million may be carried forward indefinitely 
we have recorded a valuation allowance at june  of million for the net operating loss carryforwards and a portion of the foreign and state tax credits  which we believe will not be realized based upon our estimates of future taxable income 
the american jobs creation act of permits us corporations to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries at a special one time favorable effective tax rate versus before consideration of foreign taxes paid 
we determined that we will repatriate approximately million under this legislation  and accordingly recorded a current deferred tax liability of million for federal and state taxes attributable to the repatriation of earnings at june  the cumulative amount of undistributed foreign earnings at june  was million 
no us tax expense has been recorded to cover the undistributed portion not intended for repatriation million because we intend to continue to reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings in our overseas operations 
in the normal course of business  we will undergo scheduled reviews by taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of tax credits and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
tax reviews frequently require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years subject to audit 
our us income tax returns for fiscal and prior years have been audited by the internal revenue service and are closed 
in the us  the statutory audit period has expired for fiscal years and  and is open for subsequent years 
o pension plan actuarial assumptions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements 
we use several actuarial and other statistical factors which attempt to estimate the ultimate expense and liability related to our pension plans 
these factors include assumptions about discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
in addition  subjective assumptions  such as withdrawal and mortality rates are utilized 
the actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences  depending on their magnitude  could have a significant impact on the amount of pension expense we record in any particular period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize net earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions which are primarily related to certain intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging activities do not subject us to exchange rate risk because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the intercompany receivables hedged 
the net gains or losses on these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are included within other  net  in our consolidated statements of earnings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
none of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as economic hedges of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
as a result  no foreign currency transaction gains or losses were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended june   and as of june   we had a notional amount of million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  all of which were in euros and british pounds 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed months and require us to exchange foreign currencies for united states dollars at maturity  at rates agreed to when the contract is signed
