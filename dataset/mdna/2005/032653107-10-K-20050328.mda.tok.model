overview analex is a leading provider of mission critical professional services to federal government clients 
the company specializes in providing information technology  systems engineering  security services and intelligence services in support of the us government 
all of our sales are generated using written contractual arrangements 
the contracts require us to deliver technical services to the intelligence community  analyze and support defense systems  design  develop and test aerospace systems according to the specifications provided by our customers 
during  the company had revenue of million compared to million for the prior year  a increase 
while of this increase was attributable to bai  approximately growth in revenue for the year was attributable to organic growth 
operating income was million compared to million for  and operating margin grew to compared to for earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda grew from million in to million in  with ebitda margins grown from in to in net loss to common shareholders was million compared with a net income to common shareholders for the prior year of million 
this is primarily due to the substantial non cash interest and accretion charges related to the series a and series b financing 
these charges amounted to million for  and million for during the second quarter of  the company concluded that advanced biosystems  inc abs  a then wholly owned subsidiary of the company  did not fit with the company s long term strategic plan and decided to divest abs 
abs was engaged in biomedical research for broad spectrum defenses against toxic agents capable of being used as bioterrorist weapons  such as anthrax and smallpox 
the company disposed of abs on november  therefore  the results of operations of abs are reported as discontinued operations  net of applicable income taxes  for all periods presented in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
historically  abs has been reported under a separate business segment of the company 
on may   analex acquired beta analytics  inc bai 
bai is now reported as a part of the homeland security group 
bai provides information and technology asset protection solutions  intelligence analysis  and security services to federal government and department of defense agencies 
bai s services cover a range of life cycle protection and physical security services specifically in the areas of information protection  physical security  intelligence threat assessment and analysis  technology protection  security management and security education and training 
we believe that our acquisition of bai will continue to yield significant yearly revenue and strong operating income to the company 
sales to us federal government agencies and their prime contractors represented approximately and of our total net sales during the twelve months ended december  and the department of defense accounted for approximately and of our revenue in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
nasa is our largest customer  generating and of our revenue for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
approximately of our revenue and of our operating income for fiscal year came from one prime contract with an agency within the department of defense 
approximately of our revenue for fiscal year came from one prime contract with nasa  which has a potential nine year and four month contract term if all options are exercised 
we expect that federal government contracts will continue to be the source of substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
in  of our revenue was generated as a prime contractor to the federal government 
we intend to focus on retaining and increasing the percentage of our business as prime contractor because it provides us with stronger client relationships 
the following table shows our revenue as prime contractor and as subcontractor as a percentage of our total revenue for the following periods year prime contract revenue subcontract revenue total revenue we have one reportable segment that is engaged in professional services related to information technology and systems engineering for the us government  primarily nasa and the department of defense 
this segment consists of two business groups the homeland security group and the systems engineering group 
the homeland security group provides information technology services  systems integration  hardware and software engineering and independent quality assurance in support of the us intelligence community and department of defense 
the systems engineering group provides engineering  information technology and program management support to nasa  the department of defense  and major aerospace contractors such as lockheed martin and northrop grumman  as well as smaller prime contractors 
the company s operating profit is derived from the combination of operating profit from its homeland security and systems engineering groups  offset by certain costs incurred at its corporate headquarters that are not allocable to the two groups such as intangible amortization expenses and internal costs incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions related activities 
our services are provided under three types of contracts cost reimbursement  time and materials  and fixed price contracts 
cost reimbursement contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred costs  to the extent prescribed in the contract  plus a profit component 
these contracts establish a ceiling amount that the contractor may not exceed without the approval of the contracting officer 
if our costs exceed the ceiling or are not allowable under the terms of the contract or applicable regulations  we may not be able to recover those costs 
time and material contracts provide for acquiring services on the basis of director labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates 
profit margins on time and materials contracts fluctuate based on the difference between negotiated billing rates and actual labor and overhead costs directly charged or allocated to such contracts 
we assume the risk that costs of performance may exceed the negotiated hourly rates 
fixed price contracts provide for delivery of products or services for a price that is negotiated in advance on the basis of the contractor s costs experiences 
the price is not subject to any adjustment and that means we assume the financial risk of costs overruns 
if the costs exceed the estimates  profit margins decrease and a loss may be realized on the contract 
two percent of the company s contracts are firm fixed price  level of effort contracts 
this type of contract provides a fixed hourly rate for services rendered and a minimum required level of service  usually measured in hours of services delivered 
if the company completes a task with less than the required level of effort  the company may be obligated to return a portion of the service fees invoiced 
the following table shows our revenue from each of these types of contracts as a percentage of our total revenue for the past three years year cost plus fee time and materials fixed price total however  over of the cost reimbursable contracts contain ceilings on various categories of expenses 
therefore if the company incurs expenses above these ceilings  the company will not be reimbursed by the government 
our objective is to grow sales organically and through acquisitions 
in order to assist in accomplishing this objective  we have continued to increase our selling  general and administrative expenditures so as to increase our efforts in new business development and to provide the necessary infrastructure to support a larger organization resulting from organic growth and acquisitions 
we plan to selectively acquire companies that complement and enhance our existing businesses  and are currently reviewing potential targets 
we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional financing through sale of equity and debt securities to fund our acquisitions 
the company s backlog of orders  based on remaining contract value  believed to be firm as of december  was approximately million 
the portion of the total backlog expected to be realized within is million 
funded backlog as of december  was approximately million 
included in the backlog approximation are amounts from future years of government contracts under which the government has the right to exercise an option for the company to perform services 
all of our us government contracts are subject to audit and various cost controls  and include standard provisions for termination for the convenience of the us government 
multi year us government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable

the series a preferred stock  the series a convertible notes and the series a related warrants are collectively referred to hereinafter as the series a instruments 
series a preferred stock the company determined the initial carrying value of the series a preferred stock by a two step allocation process first to the associated warrants  and second  to an embedded conversion option 
first the company allocated the proceeds from the sale of the series a preferred stock between the series a preferred stock and the series a preferred warrants based on their relative fair values  which resulted in recording a discount on the series a preferred stock 
the value of the series a warrants was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the series a preferred warrants were valued based on i the exercise price of pursuant to the series a purchase agreement  ii the stock price of as of the closing date of december  the series a closing date  iii a risk free rate of  iv a volatility of  and v an expected term of the series a preferred warrants of four years 
the risk free rate was equal to the four year us treasury rate  based on a period that is four years from the series a closing date 
the volatility was based on an average of three measurements the actual volatility in the company s stock price over the four years prior to the series a closing date  the actual volatility in the company s stock price from november  the date of the acquisition of the former analex corporation to the series a closing date  and the actual volatility in the company s stock price from march  the date the company s common stock was first listed on the american stock exchange to the series a closing date 
the resulting allocation of value to the series a preferred stock warrants was million 
second  in accordance with eitf no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  after allocating the series a preferred stock proceeds as described above  the company calculated the embedded conversion price and used it to measure the intrinsic value of the embedded conversion option 
this was determined by calculating the number of shares of common stock into which the series a preferred stock is convertible 
the value allocated to the series a preferred stock after value was allocated to the series a preferred warrants was then divided by the number of shares of common stock into which the series a preferred stock is convertible 
the result   was then compared to the current fair value of  the company s stock price as of the series a closing date 
since the conversion price was less than the fair value as of the series a closing date  a beneficial conversion feature exists 
the difference between the conversion price and the fair value as of the series a closing date was multiplied by the total number of shares of common stock into which the series a preferred stock is convertible 
the result was a beneficial conversion of approximately million 
the amount of the beneficial conversion was recorded as additional paid in capital  resulting in a further discount on the series a preferred stock

issuance costs of  are recorded as an additional discount and will be accreted to the series a preferred stock over a four year period 
the series a preferred stock accrues dividends at per annum payable quarterly in cash 
therefore  the company will accrue and pay the dividends payable each quarter at  both the accretion of and dividends on the series a preferred stock will reduce net income attributable to common stockholders 
the annual cash dividend payable on the series a preferred stock amounts to  and the annual non cash accretion amounts to  the total annual charge related to the series a preferred stock  thus  amounts to if the holders of the series a preferred stock were to convert their shares into common stock  there would be a one time  non cash charge to write off the unamortized discount related to the series a preferred stock 
the unamortized discount is comprised of the amount allocated to the fair value of the series a preferred warrants  the discount on the series a preferred stock due to the beneficial conversion and issuance costs  less any accretion and amortization taken 
at december   that amount was approximately million 
series a convertible notes the company determined the initial carrying value of the series a convertible notes by a two step allocation process first to the associated warrants  and  second  to an embedded conversion option 
first  the company allocated the proceeds from the sale of the series a convertible notes between the series a convertible notes and the series a note warrants based on their relative fair values  which resulted in the recording of a discount on the series a convertible notes 
the value of the series a convertible notes was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the series a convertible notes were valued using i the exercise price of as stated in the series a purchase agreement  ii the stock price as of the series a closing date  iii a risk free rate of  iv a volatility of  and v an expected term of the series a convertible notes of four years 
the risk free rate was equal to the four year us treasury rate  as the series a convertible notes mature in four years 
the volatility was based on an average of three measurements the actual volatility in the company s stock price over the four years prior to the series a closing date  the actual volatility in the company s stock price from november  the date of the acquisition of the former analex corporation to the series a closing date  and the actual volatility in the company s stock price from march  the date the company s common stock was first listed on the american stock exchange to the series a closing date

since the conversion price was less than the current fair value  a beneficial conversion feature exists 
the difference between the conversion price and the current fair value was multiplied by the total number of shares of common stock into which the series a convertible notes are convertible 
the result was a beneficial conversion of approximately million 
the amount of the beneficial conversion was recorded as additional paid in capital  resulting in a further discount on the series a convertible notes

issuance costs of  are recorded as deferred financings costs and will be amortized over the four year period to the maturity of the convertible notes 
the series a convertible notes accrue interest at per annum  which is payable quarterly in cash 
therefore  the company will recognize expense for the interest payable each quarter 
both the amortization of the debt discount from the allocation of fair value to the series a note warrants and the accrued interest will reduce net income over the four year life of the series a convertible notes 
the annual interest payable on the series a convertible notes amounts to  and the annual non cash interest and accretion charges amount to million 
the total annual charge related to the series a convertible notes  thus  amounts to million 
if the holders of the series a convertible notes were to convert the notes into common stock  there would be a one time  non cash charge to write off the unamortized discount related to the series a convertible notes 
the unamortized discount is comprised of the amount allocated to the fair value of the series a note warrants  the discount on the convertible notes due to beneficial conversion and issuance costs  less any accretion and amortization taken

stout repurchase agreement on july   the company also entered into a securities repurchase agreement together with the first amendment thereto dated september  and the second amendment thereto dated november   the stout repurchase agreement with company s former chairman jon m 
stout  certain members of mr 
stout s immediate family including former company director shawna stout  and certain entities controlled by mr 
stout and his family collectively  the stout parties  pursuant to which the company agreed to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock and warrants and options exercisable to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock from the stout parties for aggregate consideration of 
this transaction and the series a financing discussed above were consummated simultaneously on december  the closing occurred immediately following the approval by the company s stockholders of the series a financing 
because the consummation of the transactions under each of the series a financing and the stout repurchase agreement were conditioned upon each other  they constituted a single transaction to be voted upon by the stockholders 
the transactions contemplated by the series a financing and the stout repurchase agreement are collectively referred to herein as the pequot transaction 
the stout repurchase agreement provided for the stout non competition agreement between the company and jon stout 
the  consideration to be paid under the stout non competition agreement was recognized as a liability as of the series a closing date  and will be paid quarterly over the three year life of the agreement 
also  included in the stout repurchase agreement was the repurchase of certain warrants and stock options 
the company estimated the fair value of the warrants as of the series a closing date using a fair value option pricing model and determined that the amount the stout parties are receiving to purchase warrants is less than the fair value as of the series a closing date 
therefore  the company did not incur any additional compensation expense related to the purchase of the warrants 
however  as the company also purchased certain stock options held by the stout parties  the company incurred compensation expense as a result of the purchase of stock options from the stout parties of  which is equal to the amount paid to purchase the stock options

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies require significant management judgments  estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue the company s contracts with the government are typically cost plus fee  time and materials  or fixed price contracts 
revenue results from work performed on these contracts by the company s employees and from pass through of costs for material and work performed by subcontractors 
revenue on cost type contracts is recorded as contract allowable costs are incurred and fees earned 
revenue for time and materials contracts is recorded on the basis of contract allowable labor hours worked multiplied by the contract defined billing rates  plus the cost of materials used in performance on the contract 
profits on time and material contracts result from the difference between the cost of services performed and the contract defined billing rates for these services 
revenue on certain fixed price service contracts is recorded each period based on a monthly amount for services provided 
revenue on other fixed price contracts is recorded as costs are incurred  using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
profits on fixed price contracts result from the difference between the incurred costs and the revenue earned 
in the normal course of business  the company may be party to claims and disputes resulting from modifications and change orders and other contract matters 
claims for additional contract compensation are recognized when realization is probable and estimable 
long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or the company s related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded for these assets 
contingencies from time to time  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and establish reserves accordingly 
the amount of reserves required  if any  may change in future periods due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach to a matter such as a change in settlement strategy 
derivatives the company utilized an interest rate swap to manage interest rate exposure 
the interest rate swap had been designated as a cash flow hedge  wherein the effective portion of the change in value of the derivative instrument  based on market pricing  was reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and was reclassified into earnings as interest expense in the period when the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the change in value of the derivative instrument  if any  was recognized in current earnings during the period of change 
the interest rate swap expired in december capital resources and liquidity introduction we view the company s liquidity and capital requirements from two important perspectives operations and financing obligations primarily arisen from the company s acquisitions activities 
from the operating perspective  the company is in a stable liquidity position  with relatively minor capital requirements 
the company is a professional services company  with virtually all of its revenue derived from professional services delivered to the united states government  primarily the department of defense  pursuant to contractual arrangements that provide primarily for time and material type payment structures 
most of the company s employees are located on government facilities 
the company generally does not engage in the development of products  hardware  or software for which there is inherent technical risk 
with rare exception  employees engaged in professional services are hired and retained only when contracts have been awarded and are continuing 
employees engaged in indirect functions  such as corporate staff functions  are limited 
consequently  the risk and variability inherent in the company s operating cash flow is moderate 
two components of that moderate operating cash flow risk arise from i the ability of the government  from time to time  to expand or reduce the level of service provided under its contracts  and ii normal fluctuations in working capital  such as accounts receivable and payable 
however  given the nature of the company s service offerings  these elements of risk are not inherently highly variable 
in addition  the capital requirements of the company s service offerings are limited to infrastructure resources  such as company wide information technology resources  commercially available accounting systems  and furniture and personal computing equipment for employees located on company premises 
consequently  the company s cash flow measured on an ebitda basis has been growing  with ebitda increasing from million in to million in and with ebitda margins increasing from of revenue in to of revenue in accordingly  the company does not anticipate that it will have a need for additional capital to fund its operations over the next twelve months 
the government  however  retains the right to terminate its contracts for its convenience at any time 
were this to occur  the company s liquidity and operating results would likely be materially adversely affected 
beginning in december  the company has engaged in certain financing activities 
in the december pequot transaction  the company bought back the shares from a prior significant shareholder 
the company sold million of series a convertible notes and the million of series a preferred stock to pequot 
funds remaining after the repurchase of shares from the significant shareholder in december were then used to fund a portion of the cash cost of acquiring bai in may in order to fund the remaining portion of the cash cost of acquiring bai  the company increased its bank debt and also drew down million series b senior subordinated notes from pequot  general electric  and new york life  which were automatically converted into series b preferred stock upon shareholders approval at the company s annual stockholders meeting in september the company has  through may   a company option to draw down  under the same terms  an additional million of series b preferred stock to fund one or more subsequent acquisitions 
if unconverted  the million series a convertible notes will be due and payable in december if the million series a preferred stock is not converted into common stock by december  it will be redeemable at the option of the holders in four equal quarterly installments starting in september if the million series b preferred stock is not converted into common stock by september  at the election of the holders of of the then outstanding series b preferred stock  it will be redeemable in four equal quarterly installments 
the company s balance sheet has been complicated by these financing instruments because a substantial portion of the face value of the instruments is required  under generally accepted accounting principles  to be allocated to equity accounts  with the resulting discounted carrying value to be accreted back to full face value over the expected life of the financing instruments  with the periodic accretions taken as non cash charges to income 
consequently  gaap accounting requires that the company s statement of operations be subject to these non cash charges that produce net losses to the common shareholders  especially since most of these non cash charges are not deductible for income tax purposes 
in addition  gaap requires that the company s balance sheet carries the financing instruments at their sharply discounted values  while the company s equity is increased by corresponding amounts  subject to the periodic  non cash adjustments to both 
in assessing whether or not to issue these financing instruments  with their attendant gaap accounting requirements  the company considers the purposes for which the funds are to be used and the overall impact upon the company and value to shareholders  which uses have generally involved acquisitions 
the company generally only issues these financing instruments when the combined effects of the financing and the acquisition are expected to enhance the strategic objectives of the company on a long term basis and are anticipated to be accretive on a forward basis to the company s shareholders  measured on an as if converted basis 
the as if converted basis assumes that all convertible instruments  options  and warrants are exercised  with any proceeds received assumed applied under the gaap treasury buyback method to notionally repurchase a portion of the company s shares outstanding 
the company s currently outstanding financing instruments will either mature according to their terms or  at the election of the holders  be converted into common stock of the company  unless subject to forced conversion at the election of the company 
a conversion prior to maturity will likely cause an acceleration of any remaining discount of these instruments from face value as a charge to earnings at the time of conversion  and these accelerated non cash charges could be substantial 
it is the company s long term expectation that  as the company grows both organically and  possibly  through accretive acquisitions  the company s need for complex convertible financing instruments should diminish and that  either through expiration  redemption or conversion of the current financing instruments  the company s financial statements should become less complex 
however  there can be no assurance as to whether or when this may occur 
at december   the bank facility allowed a maximum funded debt to ebitda ratio of times or lower  and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio to ebitda of times or greater 
the company was in compliance with both covenants  with a funded debt ratio of times and a fixed charge coverage ratio of times 
in summary  the variability of the company s operational cash flows is not substantial and the need for capital resources is minimal given the nature of the company s professional services offerings 
if the financing instruments remain unconverted in and  a cash requirement to fund repayment and redemption of our financial instruments will arise 
analysis of the statement of cash flows the company s statement of cash flows for combines the cash flows from on going operations with the effect of the acquisition of bai in may the working capital at december  decreased by approximately million from december   primarily due to cash used for the purchase of bai in may in the amount of approximately million 
in the twelve months ended december   the company recorded a net loss of million and ebitda as defined below of million  after add backs for interest of million  taxes of million  depreciation of million and amortization of million 
in the twelve months ended december   the company recorded net income of million and ebitda as defined below of million  after add backs for interest of million  taxes of million  depreciation of million and amortization of million 
while we expect that borrowing availability under our credit facility  together with cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs for normal operations for at least the next twelve months  we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional financing through sale of equity or debt securities to fund our future acquisitions 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interests 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
if additional financing is raised through sale of our common stock  it may result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders 
in december  we sold to pequot million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
the series a convertible notes bear interest at an annual rate of 
they are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries and are guaranteed by the company s subsidiaries 
the convertible notes will mature on december  the indebtedness incurred with respect to the series a convertible notes is material in relation to our ability to service the debt from our operating cash flow and our ability to repay the debt in full at maturity 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to repay the series a convertible notes or to redeem the series a preferred stock in accordance with their respective terms 
our ability to repay the series a convertible notes at maturity may also be adversely affected by the right of the holders of the series a preferred stock to contemporaneously require the company to redeem their shares of series a preferred stock 
ebitda consists of earnings before interest expense  interest and other income  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda does not represent funds available for the company s discretionary use and is not intended to represent cash flow from operations 
ebitda should also not be construed as a substitute for operating income or a better measure of liquidity than cash flow from operating activities  which are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us ebitda excludes components that are significant in understanding and assessing the company s results of operations and cash flows 
ebitda is considered to be relevant and useful information  which is often reported and widely used by analysts  investors and other interested parties 
accordingly  the company is disclosing this information to permit a more comprehensive analysis of the company s operating performance  as an additional meaningful measure of performance and liquidity  and to provide additional information with respect to the company s ability to meet future debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
net cash provided by continuing operating activities was million during the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
net cash used in discontinued operating activities was million during the twelve months ended december   compared to net cash provided by discontinued operating activities million for the prior year 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities resulted from an increase in cash used by discontinued operations as noted in the preceding paragraph 
net cash used in investing activities during the twelve months ended december  was million 
net cash used in investing activities in this period was primarily related to the purchase of bai for million 
in addition  fixed asset purchases of million were made 
net cashed used in investing in was million  million was for fixed asset purchases  while million was for issuance costs of the series a financing 
net cash provided by financing activities in amounted to million compared to net cash provided by financing activities in of million 
financing activities for are primarily attributable to the purchase of bai 
in the company had net bank borrowings of million compared to net payments of bank debt of million in for  the company generated a net decrease in cash and equivalents of million compared to a net increase of million in interest expense of million consists of cash and non cash expense 
cash interest expense was million and non cash interest expense that is generated by amortization of the convertible debt discount was million  representing million for series a preferred stock and million for series b preferred stock

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risks and hedging activities the company s outstanding bank debt bears interest at variable interest rates tied to libor 
the use of variable rate debt to finance operations and capital improvements exposes the company to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
the company uses an interest rate swap to reduce the interest rate exposure on these variable rate obligations 
the company does not hold any derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the company s million term loan facility from bank of america  which carried interest comprised of two components floating rate libor plus a credit performance margin  was paid in full on may  the company had entered into an interest rate swap agreement with bank of america whereby its obligation to pay floating rate libor was swapped into a fixed rate obligation at beginning in january the swap agreement expired on december  interest rate hedges that are designated as cash flow hedges hedge the future cash outflows on debt 
interest rate swaps that convert variable payments to fixed payments  interest rate caps  floors  collars and forwards are cash flow hedges 
the unrealized gains losses in the fair value of these hedges are reported on the balance sheet and included in other long term liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to either accumulated other comprehensive income loss or in earnings depending on the hedging relationship 
if the hedging transaction is a cash flow hedge  then the offsetting gains losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
over time  the unrealized gains losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income loss will be recognized in earnings consistent with when the hedged items are recognized in earnings 
under the interest rate swap  the company paid the bank at a fixed rate and received variable interest at a rate approximating the variable rate of the company s debt  thereby creating the equivalent of a fixed rate obligation 
the following table summarizes the original financial terms of the company s interest rate swap notional value variable rate received fixed rate paid effective date expiration date libor the notional value of the interest rate swap declined as the amount of the term loan was paid down 
at december   the notional value of the swap was increases in prevailing interest rates could increase the company s interest payment obligations relating to variable rate debt 
for example  a basis points increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by  based on debt levels at december
