certain of these as well as other risks and uncertainties are described in more detail in this annual report on form k 
the company develops  markets and supports service management software solutions  which are licensed to companies that sell and service equipment  or sell and deliver professional services 
the company s principal product offering  the astea alliance suite  integrates and automates sales and service business processes and thereby increases competitive advantages  top line revenue growth and profitability through better management of information  people  assets and cash flows 
astea alliance offers substantially broader and far superior capabilities over the company s predecessor product  dispatch  which was designed for only field service and customer support management applications 
the company s products and services are primarily used in industries such as information technology  medical devices and diagnostic systems  industrial controls and instrumentation  retail systems  office automation  imaging systems  facilities management and telecommunications 
an eclectic group of other industries  all with equipment sales and service requirements  are also represented in astea s customer base 
the company maintains offices in the united states  united kingdom  australia  israel and the netherlands 
the company generates revenues from two sources software license fees for its software products  and services and maintenance revenues from professional services  which includes consulting  implementation  training and maintenance related to those products 
software license fees accounted for of the company s total revenues in  which was mostly comprised of sales of astea alliance 
software license fee revenues also include some fees from the sublicensing of third party software  primarily relational database licenses 
typically  customers pay a license fee for the software based on the number of licensed users 
depending on the contract terms and conditions  software license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product if no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable 
if significant vendor obligations exist at the time of delivery or if the product is subject to uncertain customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until no significant obligations remain or acceptance has occurred 
the remaining component of the company s revenues consists principally of fees derived from professional services associated with the implementation and deployment of the company s software products and maintenance fees for ongoing customer support  primarily external customer technical support services and product enhancements 
professional services including training are charged on an hourly or daily basis and billed on a regular basis pursuant to customer work orders 
training services may also be charged on a per attendee basis with a minimum daily charge

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in its summary of accounting policies  note  to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below  however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in accordance with statement of operations procedures sop  which provides guidelines on the recognition of software license fee revenue 
principally  license revenue may be recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and the collection of the fee is probable 
the company allocates a portion of its software revenue to post contract support activities or to other services or products provided to the customer free of charge or at non standard discounts when provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement 
amounts allocated are based upon standard prices charged for those services or products 
software license fees for resellers or other members of the indirect sales channel are based on a fixed percentage of the company s standard prices 
the company recognizes software license revenue for such contracts based upon the terms and conditions provided by the reseller to its customer 
revenue from post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the contract on a straight line basis 
consulting and training service revenue is generally recognized at the time the service is performed 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment  provided that the contract has been executed  delivery of the software has occurred  fees are fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
fees from the service component in these types of contracts are recognized as the services are performed 
in instances where the aforementioned criteria have not been met  both the license and the consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
in limited instances  the company will enter into contracts for which revenue is recognized under contract accounting 
the accounting for such arrangements requires judgment  which impacts the timing of revenue recognition and provision for estimated losses  if applicable 
accounts receivable the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  the company analyzes the payment history of its significant past due accounts  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general strength of the economy  the company develops what it considers to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment by the management of the company 
actual uncollectible amounts may differ from the company s estimate 
capitalized software research and development costs the company accounts for its internal software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
the company capitalizes software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility through the product s availability for general release 
costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to product development expense 
development costs associated with product enhancements that extend the original product s life or significantly improve the original product s marketability are also capitalized once technological feasibility has been established 
software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis over the greater of the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the products usually two years  beginning with the initial release to customers 
during the first quarter of  the company revised the estimated life for its capitalized software products from three years to two years based on current sales trends and the rate of product release 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining useful life of the capitalized software development costs should be revised or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of capitalized software based on the estimated future revenues of each product 
as of december   management believes that no revisions to the remaining useful lives or write downs of capitalized software development costs are required

however  if current projections trail expectations  the company has plans in place to reduce operating expenditures appropriately in order to continue to fund all required expenditures 
the board of directors from time to time reviews the company s forecasted operations and financial condition to determine whether and when payment of a dividend or dividends is appropriate 
the company does not plan any significant capital expenditures in in addition  it does not anticipate that its operations or financial condition will be affected materially by inflation

from time to time  however  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not historical fact may constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the risks  uncertainties and other information discussed within this annual report on form k  as well as the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
the following discussion of the company s risk factors should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto set forth elsewhere in this report 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in forward looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this report and presented by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial conditions recent history of net losses the company has a history of net losses 
although the company generated net income of million in  it incurred net losses of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal as of december   stockholders equity is approximately million  which is net of an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
moreover  the company expects to continue to incur additional operating expenses for research and development 
as a result  the company will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
the company may not be able to achieve the necessary revenue growth or profitability in the future 
if the company does not attain or sustain profitability or raise additional equity or debt in the future  the company may be unable to continue its operations 
uncertain market acceptance of astea alliance  decreased revenues from dispatch in each of   and   and respectively  of the company s total revenues was derived from the licensing of dispatch and the providing of professional services in connection with the implementation  deployment and maintenance of dispatch installations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company originally introduced astea alliance in august in order to target a market segment in which dispatch was not cost effective or attractive 
subsequent  rapid changes in technology have now positioned the astea alliance suite  introduced in and which includes the astea alliance functionality  to supercede dispatch as the company s flagship product 
as a result  there are no license sales planned or anticipated for dispatch to new customers 
total license revenues from dispatch was  in there were no license revenues of dispatch in total dispatch revenues have declined in each of the last three fiscal years and that trend is expected to continue and accelerate 
while the company has licensed astea alliance to over companies worldwide in through  revenues from sales of astea alliance alone are not yet sufficient to support the expenses of the company 
the company s future success will depend mainly on its ability to increase licenses of the astea alliance suite offerings  on developing new products and product enhancements to complement its existing product offerings  on its ability to continue support and maintenance revenues from dispatch  and on its ability to control its operating expenses 
any failure of the company s products to achieve or sustain market acceptance  or of the company to sustain its current position in the customer relationship management software market  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase demand for astea alliance  obtain an acceptable level of support and maintenance revenues from dispatch  or to lower its expenses  thereby avoiding future losses 
need for development of new products the company s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments  industry standards and the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers  including developments within the client server  thin client and object oriented computing environments 
such developments may require  from time to time  substantial capital investments by the company in product development and testing 
the company intends to continue its commitment to research and development and its efforts to develop new products and product enhancements 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products and product enhancements  that new products and product enhancements will meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance  or that the company s current or future products will conform to industry requirements 
furthermore  reallocation of resources by the company  such as the diversion of research and development personnel to development of a particular feature for a potential or existing customer  can delay new products and certain product enhancements 
some of our customers adopted our software on an incremental basis 
these customers may not expand usage of our software on an enterprise wide basis or implement new software products introduced by the company 
the failure of the software to perform to customer expectations or otherwise to be deployed on an enterprise wide basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to collect revenues or to increase revenues from new as well as existing customers 
if the company is unable to develop and market new products or enhancements of existing products successfully  the company s ability to remain competitive in the industry will be materially adversely effected 
rapid technological change in this industry there is a continual emergence of new technologies and continual change in customer requirements 
because of the rapid pace of technological change in the application software industry  the company s current market position could be eroded rapidly by product advancements 
in order to remain competitive  the company must introduce new products or product enhancements that meet customers requirements in a timely manner 
if the company is unable to do this  it may lose current and prospective customers to competitors 
the company s application environment relies primarily on software development tools from microsoft corporation in the case of astea alliance  and progress software corporation  in the case of dispatch if alternative software development tools were to be designed and generally accepted by the marketplace  we could be at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies employing such alternative developmental tools 
burdens of customization certain of the company s clients request customization of astea alliance products to address unique characteristics of their businesses or computing environments 
in these situations  the company applies contract accounting to determine the recognition of license revenues 
the company s commitment to customization could place a burden on its client support resources or delay the delivery or installation of products  which  in turn  could materially adversely affect its relationship with significant clients or otherwise adversely affect business and results of operations 
in addition  the company could incur penalties or reductions in revenues for failures to develop or timely deliver new products or product enhancements under development agreements and other arrangements with customers 
if customers are not able to customize or deploy the company s products successfully  the customer may not complete expected product deployment  which would prevent recognition of revenues and collection of amounts due  and could result in claims against the company 
risk of product defects  failure to meet performance criteria the company s software is intended for use in enterprise wide applications that may be critical to its customer s business 
as a result  customers and potential customers typically demand strict requirements for installation and deployment 
the company s software products are complex and may contain undetected errors or failures  particularly when software must be customized for a particular customer  when first introduced or when new versions are released 
although the company conducts extensive product testing during product development  the company has at times delayed commercial release of software until problems were corrected and  in some cases  has provided enhancements to correct errors in released software 
the company could  in the future  lose revenues as a result of software errors or defects 
despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors in the software  customizations or releases might not be detected until after initiating commercial shipments  which could result in additional costs  delays  possible damage to the company s reputation and could cause diminished demand for the company s products 
this could lead to customer dissatisfaction and reduce the opportunity to renew maintenance contracts or sell new licenses 
continued dependence on large contracts may result in lengthy sales and implementation cycles and impact revenue recognition and cash flow the sale and implementation of the company s products generally involve a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers 
as a result  the company s sales process often is subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes attendant to significant capital expenditures  definition of special customer implementation requirements  and extensive contract negotiations with the customer 
therefore  the sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer and typically lasts between four and nine months 
during this time the company may devote significant time and resources to a prospective customer  including costs associated with multiple site visits  product demonstrations and feasibility studies 
the company may experience a number of significant delays over which the company has no control 
because the costs associated with the sale of the product are fixed in current periods  timing differences between incurring costs and recognizing of revenue associated with a particular project may result 
moreover  in the event of any downturn in any existing or potential customer s business or the economy in general  purchases of the company s products may be deferred or canceled 
furthermore  the implementation of the company s products typically takes several months of integration of the product with the customer s other existing systems and customer training 
a successful implementation requires a close working relationship between the customer and members of the company s professional service organization 
these issues make it difficult to predict the quarter in which expected orders will occur 
delays in implementation of products could cause some or all of the revenues from those licenses to be shifted from the expected quarter to a subsequent quarter or quarters 
in these situations  the company applies contract accounting to determine the recognition of license revenue 
when the company has provided consulting services to implement certain larger projects  some customers have in the past delayed payment of a portion of license fees until implementation was complete and in some cases have disputed the consulting fees charged for implementation 
there can be no assurance the company will not experience additional delays or disputes regarding payment in the future  particularly if the company receives orders for large  complex installations 
additionally  as a result of the application of the revenue recognition rules applicable to the company s licenses under generally accepted accounting principles  license revenues may be recognized in periods after those in which the respective licenses were signed 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results may be significant the company s quarterly operating results have in the past and may in the future vary or decrease significantly depending on factors such as o revenue from software sales  o the timing of new product releases  o market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  o customer order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products  o the size and timing of significant orders  the recognition of revenue from such orders  o changes in pricing policies by the company and its competitors  o the introduction of alternative technologies  o changes in operating expenses  o changes in the company s strategy  o personnel changes  o the effect of potential acquisitions by the company and its competitors  and general domestic and international economic and political factors 
the company has limited or no control over many of these factors 
due to all these factors  it is possible that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be materially adversely affected 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results due to seasonal factors the company expects to experience fluctuations in the sale of licenses for its products due to seasonal factors 
the company has experienced and anticipates that it may experience relatively lower sales in the first fiscal quarter due to patterns in capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of current and prospective customers 
the company also expects that sales may decline during the summer months of its third quarter  particularly in the european markets 
moreover  the company generally records most of its total quarterly license revenues in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last half of that third month 
this concentration of license revenues is influenced by customer tendencies to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter 
the company expects these revenue patterns to continue for the foreseeable future 
thus  its results of operations may vary seasonally in accordance with licensing activity  and will also depend upon recognition of revenue from such licenses from time to time 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
general economic conditions may affect operations as business has grown  the company has become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
because of the recent economic slowdown in the united states and in other parts of the world  many companies are delaying or reducing technology purchases and investments 
similarly  the company s customers may delay payment for company products causing accounts receivable to increase 
in addition  terrorist attacks could further contribute to the slowdown in the economies of north america  europe and asia 
the overall impact to the company of this slowdown is difficult to predict  however  revenues could decline  which would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and on its financial condition  as well as on its ability to sustain profitability 
competition in the customer relationship management software market is intense the company competes in the crm software market 
this market is highly competitive and the company expects competition in the market to increase 
the company s competitors include large public companies such as oracle  peoplesoft and siebel  as well as traditional enterprise resource planning erp software providers such as sap that are developing crm capabilities 
in addition  a number of smaller privately held companies generally focus only on discrete areas of the crm software marketplace 
because the barriers to entry in the crm software market are relatively low  new competitors may emerge with products that are superior to the company s products or that achieve greater market acceptance 
moreover  the crm industry is currently experiencing significant consolidation  as larger public companies seek to enter the crm market through acquisitions or establish other cooperative relationships among themselves  thereby enhancing their ability to compete in this market with their combined resources 
some of the company s existing and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources than the company 
these and other competitors pose business risks to the company because o they compete for the same customers that the company tries to attract  o if the company loses customers to its competitors  it may be difficult or impossible to win them back  o lower prices and a smaller market share could limit the company s revenue generating ability  reduce its gross margins and restrict its ability to become profitable or sustain profitability  and o competitors may be able to devote greater resources to more quickly respond to emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to the development  promotion and sales of their products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not adversely affect its business and results of operations 
risk of dependence on proprietary technology the company depends heavily on proprietary technology for its business to succeed 
the company licenses its products to customers under license agreements containing  among other terms  provisions protecting against the unauthorized use  copying and transfer of the licensed program 
in addition  the company relies on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect the company s proprietary rights in its products and technology 
the legal protection is limited  however 
unauthorized parties may copy aspects of the company s products and obtain and use information that the company believes is proprietary 
other parties may breach confidentiality agreements or other contracts they have made with the company 
policing unauthorized use of the company s software is difficult and  while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
there can be no assurance that any of the measures taken by the company will be adequate to protect its proprietary technology or that its competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technologies 
if the company fails to successfully enforce its proprietary technology  its competitive position may be harmed 
other software providers could develop similar technology independently  which may infringe on the company s proprietary rights 
the company may not be able to detect infringement and may lose a competitive position in the market before it does so 
in addition  competitors may design around the company s technology or develop competing technologies 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
litigation may be necessary to enforce the company s proprietary rights 
such litigation is time consuming  has an uncertain outcome and could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources 
however  if the company fails to successfully enforce its proprietary rights  the company s competitive position may be harmed 
possible infringement of third party intellectual property rights substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights are common in this industry 
the company is not aware that its products and technologies employ technology that infringes any valid  existing proprietary rights of third parties 
while there currently are no pending lawsuits against the company regarding infringement of any existing patents or other intellectual property rights or any notices that it is infringing the intellectual property rights of others  third parties may assert such claims in the future 
any claims  with or without merit  could o be time consuming to defend  o result in costly litigation or damage awards  o divert management s attention and resources  o cause product shipment delays  or o require the company to seek to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may not be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
a successful claim of intellectual property infringement against the company or the company s failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could seriously harm its business because the company would not be able to sell the impacted product without exposing itself to litigation risk and damages 
furthermore  redevelopment of the product so as to avoid infringement could cause the company to incur significant additional expense and delay 
dependence on technology from third parties the company integrates various third party software products as components of its software 
the company s business would be disrupted if this software  or functional equivalents of this software  were either no longer available to the company or no longer offered to the company on commercially reasonable terms 
in either case  the company would be required to either redesign its software to function with alternate third party software or develop these components itself  which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in software shipments 
furthermore  the company might be forced to limit the features available in its current or future software offerings 
need to expand indirect sales the company has historically sold its products through its direct sales force and a limited number of distributors value added resellers  system integrators and sales agents 
the company s ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on its success in establishing relationships with distributors and oem partners 
the company is currently investing  and plans to continue to invest  significant resources to expand its domestic and international direct sales force and develop distribution relationships 
the company s distributors also sell or can potentially sell products offered by the company s competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of its existing or future third party distribution partners or that such partners will recommend  or continue to recommend  the company s products 
the inability to establish or maintain successful relationships with distributors and oem partners or to train its direct sales force could cause its sales to decline 
risks of future acquisitions as part of astea s growth strategy  it may pursue the acquisition of businesses  technologies or products that are complementary to its business 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks that could harm the company s business  including the diversion of management s attention  the integration of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  and the potential loss of key employees 
in particular  the failure to maintain adequate operating and financial control systems or unexpected difficulties encountered during expansion could harm the company s business 
acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
risks associated with international sales astea s international sales accounted for of the company s revenues in  in  and in the company expects that international sales will continue to be a significant component of its business 
in the company s efforts to expand its international presence  it will face certain risks  which it may not be successful in addressing 
these risks include o difficulties in establishing and managing international distribution channels and in translating products into foreign languages  o difficulties finding staff to manage foreign operations and collect accounts receivable  o difficulties enforcing intellectual property rights  o liabilities and financial exposure under foreign laws and regulatory requirements  o fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates  and o potentially adverse tax consequences 
additionally  the current economic difficulties in several asian countries could have an adverse impact on the company s international operations in future periods 
moreover  the currency unification in europe may change the market for the company s business software 
any of these factors  if not successfully addressed  could harm the company s operating results 
research and development in israel  risks of potential political  economic or military instability astea s principal research and development facilities are located in israel 
accordingly  political  economic and military conditions in israel may directly affect its business 
continued political and economic instability or armed conflicts in israel or in the region could directly harm the company s business and operations 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors  and a state of hostility has existed in varying degrees and intensity 
this state of hostility has led to security and economic problems for israel 
the future of peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors  particularly in light of the recent violence and political unrest in israel and the rest of the middle east  remains uncertain and several countries still restrict business with israel and israeli companies 
these restrictive laws and policies may also materially harm the company s operating results and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel that are required to perform military service many of the company s employees in israel are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty in the israeli army and are subject to being called to active duty at any time  which could adversely affect the company s ability to pursue its planned research and development efforts 
the company cannot assess the full impact of these requirements on its workforce or business and the company cannot predict the effect of any expansion or reduction of these obligations 
however  in light of the recent violence and political unrest in israel  there is an increased risk that a number of the company s employees could be called to active military duty without prior notice 
the company s operations could be disrupted by the absence for a significant period of time of one or more of our key employees or a significant number of other employees due to military service 
any such disruption in the company s operations could harm its operations 
risks associated with inflation and currency fluctuations the company generates most of its revenues in us dollars but all of its costs associated with the foreign operations located in europe  the pacific rim and israel are denominated in the respective local currency and translated into us dollars for consolidation and reporting 
as a result  the company is exposed to risks to the extent that the rate of inflation in europe  the pacific rim or israel exceeds the rate of devaluation of their related foreign currency in relation to the us dollar or if the timing of such devaluations lags behind inflation in europe  the pacific rim or israel 
in that event  the cost of the company s operations in europe  the pacific rim and israel measured in terms of us dollars will increase and the us dollar measured results of operations will suffer 
historically  israel has experienced periods of high inflation 
dependence on key personnel  competition for employees the continued growth and success largely depends on the managerial and technical skills of key technical  sales and management personnel 
in particular  the company s business and operations are substantially dependent of the performance of zack b 
bergreen  the founder and chief executive officer 
if mr 
bergreen were to leave or become unable to perform services for the company  the business would likely be harmed 
the company s success also depends  to a substantial degree  upon its continuing ability to attract  motivate and retain other talented and highly qualified personnel 
competition for key personnel is intense  particularly so in recent years 
from time to time the company has experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining talented and qualified employees 
there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key technical  sales and managerial employees or that it can attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel in the future 
if the company fails to attract or retain enough skilled personnel  its product development efforts may be delayed  the quality of its customer service may decline and sales may decline 
concentration of ownership currently  zack b 
bergreen  the company s chief executive officer  beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company 
as a result  mr 
bergreen exercises significant control over the company through his ability to influence and control the election of directors and all other matters that require action by the company s stockholders 
under certain circumstances  mr 
bergreen could prevent or delay a change of control of the company which may be favored by a significant portion of the company s other stockholders  or cause a change of control not favored by the majority of the company s other stockholders 
mr 
bergreen s ability under certain circumstances to influence  cause or delay a change in control of the company also may have an adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
possible volatility of stock price the market price of the common stock has in the past been  and may continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations in response to  and may be adversely affected by  variations in quarterly operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  developments in the software industry  and adverse earnings or other financial announcements of the company s customers as well as other factors 
in addition  the stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time  which may bear no meaningful relationship to the company s performance 
broad market fluctuations  as well as economic conditions generally and in the software industry specifically  may result in material adverse effects on the market price of the company s common stock 
limitations of the company charter documents the company s certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that could discourage a proxy contest or make more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of the company s common stock  including provisions that allow the board of directors to take into account a number of non economic factors  such as the social  legal and other effects upon employees  suppliers  customers and creditors  when evaluating offers for the company s acquisition 
such provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for the company s shares of common stock 
the board of directors is authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that may be superior to the company s common stock and that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of our holders of common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock or of rights to purchase preferred stock could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
nasdaq smallcap market compliance requirements the company s common stock trades on the nasdaq smallcap market  which has certain compliance requirements for continued listing of common stock  including a series of financial tests relating to shareholder equity  public float  number of market makers and shareholders  and maintaining a minimum bid price per share for the company s common stock 
the result of delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market could be a reduction in the liquidity of any investment in the company s common stock and a material adverse effect on the price of its common stock 
delisting could reduce the ability of holders of the company s common stock to purchase or sell shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they could have done in the past 
this lack of liquidity would make it more difficult for the company to raise capital in the future 
although the company is currently in compliance with all continued listing requirements of nasdaq smallcap  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to satisfy such requirements
