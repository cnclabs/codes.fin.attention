overview radioshack is primarily a retailer of consumer electronics and services 
we seek to differentiate ourselves from our various competitors by focusing on dominating cost effective solutions to meet everyone s routine electronics needs and families distinct electronics wants 
this strategy allows us to take advantage of the unique opportunities provided by our extensive retail presence  knowledgeable sales staff  and relationships with reputable vendors 
we believe this strategy provides us with the opportunity to increase our market share in the highly competitive consumer electronics area 
in addition  we continue to focus on methods to reduce the costs of products sold and selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues 
furthermore  we believe that by focusing on opportunities such as innovative products  new markets  licensing opportunities and creative distribution channels  we can ultimately generate increased financial returns for our shareholders over the long term 
we have identified two key opportunities to drive company growth  which are in alignment with our overall strategy described above 
we are focusing on growth of our core business  which includes our company operated stores  dealers and our web site www 
radioshack 
com  as well as businesses that we consider to be close to our core strengths  which includes retail services  international operations and consumer electronics repairs 
with respect to our core business  our strategy is to enhance our brands and customer experiences in our stores 
we are accomplishing this by focusing on improvement of our product assortment  store personnel and store environment 
in order to improve our product assortment  we are customizing key stores by market area  with the goal of providing products that are tailored to the customers of that particular market 
we are also focusing on high performing product categories  while de emphasizing other product categories that have had lower historical performances 
in addition  we are attempting to identify technologies that we believe we can grow  based on our established ability to accelerate the adoption rate of new technologies 
with respect to store personnel  we are enhancing our training  compensation and store operating procedures  including our receiving  labor scheduling and hours of operation 
finally  we have improved our store environment by rolling out an updated store format to nearly more stores in we intend to accelerate this roll out in in addition  we make continuous enhancements to our store format as stores are rolled out 
we are also focusing on businesses that are considered to be close to our core strengths 
this close to core strategy includes expanding our retail services business  recognizing innovative product channels and opportunities  and identifying international expansion opportunities 
in order to identify innovative product channels and opportunities  we are focusing on creating innovative relationships with key parties such as vendors and product developers  utilizing new channels  and obtaining intellectual property and licensing rights to innovative products 
in  we significantly expanded our retail services business by purchasing the wireless kiosks in sam s club 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we acquired wireless kiosk fixtures and inventory located within sam s club retail locations  as well as certain other assets and liabilities from wireless retail  inc wri 
the total purchase price was million 
in conjunction with this transaction  we received cash and commitments from wireless carriers of million 
regarding our sam s club operations  we pay rent for the use of the kiosk area within sam s club locations  and while utilizing our own employees  pos system  and store fixtures 
another component of our retail services business is our sprint kiosk locations  which are sprint branded and are located in malls 
at these locations  which we staff  we sell sprint wireless hardware and related accessories 
we have a profit sharing and working capital arrangement with sprint related to these locations 
we expect to continue to identify additional opportunities in our overall retail services business in key indicators of financial performance for management to identify our progress in achieving our solutions strategy  we use several key financial performance metrics  including net sales and operating revenues metrics  gross margin metrics  and selling  general and administrative sg a expense and operating margin metrics 
net sales and operating revenues metrics as a retailer  we consider growth in revenue to be a key indicator of our overall financial performance 
we examine our revenue by using several key metrics  including overall change in net sales and operating revenue  comparable company store sales growth  average tickets per store and average sales per ticket 
the change in net sales and operating revenue provides us with an overall indication of the demand for our products and services 
comparable company store sales growth indicates the extent to which sales were impacted by growth in existing sales channels 
comparable company store sales include the sales of any domestic  retail location where we have a physical presence  including company operated stores and kiosks  that has more than full months of recorded sales 
average tickets per store  in conjunction with average sales per ticket  provide us with an indication of whether the changes in revenues were generated by a higher volume of purchases or by purchases of products with higher prices 
the table below summarizes these revenue metrics for the years indicated net sales and operating revenues growth comparable store sales growth average tickets per store per day average sales per ticket in addition to the metrics above  we review the revenue per square foot of our various channels of distribution to determine productivity of our product assortment and the overall distribution channel 
gross margin metrics we also view our gross margin as a key metric of our financial performance  as it indicates the extent to which we are able to reduce our product costs and optimize product mix 
the table below summarizes gross margin for the years indicated gross margin sg a expense and operating margin metrics we believe that our ability to leverage our fixed expense base and  accordingly  increase operating margin is an important indicator of our financial performance and process efficiency 
the table below summarizes these metrics for the years indicated sg a expense as a percentage of sales operating margin retail outlets the table below shows our retail locations broken down between company operated stores  kiosks and dealer outlets 
while the dealer outlets represented approximately of radioshack s total retail locations at december   our product sales to dealers are less than of our total net sales and operating revenues see results of operations below

ft 
company operated stores     kiosks dealer outlets n a    total number of retail locations    over the past two years  we have closed over company operated stores  net of new store openings and relocations 
this trend is due to not renewing locations that fail to meet our financial return hurdles 
it is anticipated that company operated stores will decline in by about stores 
kiosks consist of sam s club locations and sprint locations at the end of and sprint locations at year end sam s club has the unconditional right to assume the operation of up to locations in total and to date has provided us with notice that  effective april  sam s club will assume operation of kiosk locations previously operated by us 
we expect the number of sprint kiosks to increase by approximately during over the past two years  we have closed over dealer outlets  net of new outlet openings or conversion to company operated stores 
this trend is due to the closure of smaller outlets that failed to meet our minimum purchase requirements 
it is anticipated that dealer outlets in will not change materially from results of operations net sales and operating revenues by channel of distribution are as follows year ended december  in millions company operated store sales    kiosk sales dealer and other sales net sales and operating revenues    dealer and other sales not only include our sales to the independent dealers  but also include sales and operating revenues generated from our www

these increases were primarily the result of a increase in our wireless platform sales 
an increase in average store volume and the addition of kiosk locations also contributed to our overall sales increase 
dealer and other sales  which include sales to our dealer outlets  in addition to retail support operations and other sales  were up million for  or an increase of  when compared to sales to our dealers remain substantially less than of our total sales 
revenue from our retail support operations  service plans and other sales is generated primarily from outside sales of our repair centers and domestic and overseas manufacturing  in addition to our e commerce revenue 
the increase in these sales in was primarily a result of our restructuring of our extended service contract  partially offset due to the disposition of radioshack installation services amerilink in september sales in our wireless platform which is made up of wireless handsets and communication devices such as scanners and two way radios increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in compared to this sales increase was due to both an increase in wireless handset unit sales and an increase in the revenue per wireless handsets 
emphasis on national carrier service and product offerings with desirable product features and content  such as color screens and cameras also drove the favorable results 
we anticipate sales in the wireless platform will increase for  primarily as a result of a full year of sam s club kiosk sales and the planned expansion of our sprint kiosks 
sales in our accessory platform which includes accessories for home entertainment products  wireless handsets  digital imaging products and computers  as well as residential phones and power decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to the decrease in this platform resulted primarily from a decline in home entertainment accessories  mostly offset by increases in wireless power and digital imaging accessories

sales in our power platform which includes general and special purpose batteries and battery chargers decreased slightly in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these declines were primarily the result of a sales decline in special purpose batteries and battery chargers  however  the decline was substantially offset by a sales increase in general purpose batteries 
sales in our service platform which includes prepaid wireless airtime  bill payment revenue and warranty service plans decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these decreases were primarily due to a decrease in wireless related services 
sales in our technical platform which includes wire and cable  connectivity products  components and tools  as well as hobby and robotic end products decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these decreases were primarily due to a sales decline in wire and cable products and the related connectivity products 
gross profit gross profit for was  million or of net sales and operating revenues  compared with  million or of net sales and operating revenues in  resulting in a increase in gross profit and a basis point increase in our gross profit percentage 
these increases over the prior year were primarily due to significantly less margin erosion from price markdowns  we sold over less in discontinued and devalued merchandise in versus the prior year 
in addition  the benefits of centralized procurement and better vendor management enabled us to sell like products year over year at higher gross margins 
these increases were partially offset by a change in merchandise mix among platforms  resulting in increased sales of lower margin products  notably wireless  and decreased sales of higher margin products like accessories

payroll expense increased in dollars  but decreased as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues 
this dollar increase was due to the higher sales based compensation we paid as a result of our increase in company comparable store sales  as well as our acquisition of the sam s club kiosk locations and related personnel in october we expect payroll expense to increase in due to the full year effect of the acquisition of the sam s club kiosk business and our planned increase in the number of sprint kiosk locations 
advertising expense increased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues 
this increase is primarily related to an increase in expenditures associated with the holiday selling season

rent expense increased in dollars  but decreased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues 
the dollar increase was due primarily to lease renewals and relocations at higher rates  as well as the acquisition of the sam s club kiosk business in october we expect an increase in rent expense  primarily as a result of the full year effect of the acquisition of the sam s club kiosk business and sprint kiosk expansion 
insurance expense decreased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues  as a result of both fewer claims and a decrease in the number of participants in our insurance programs 
our insurance expense relates to losses  claims and insurance premiums  which are partially offset by contributions from health insurance participants

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million dollars to million and increased to of net sales and operating revenues  compared to for the increase in depreciation was primarily attributable to new store fixtures for existing company operated stores  as well as the hardware and software associated with information systems upgrades

interest income decreased approximately to million in from million in  despite an increase in investment rates 
this was primarily the result of a million decrease in interest received from tax settlements in compared to  as well as a lower average investment balance

recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued revised fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin r 
fin r requires the consolidation of an entity in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity variable interest entities or vies 
fin r is applicable for financial statements of public entities that have interests in vies or potential vies referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  applications by public entities for all other types of entities are required in financial statements for periods ending after march  the application of fin r did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity  and does not apply to our dealer outlets 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to sfas r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r beginning with the third quarter of we intend to elect the modified prospective transition method  which will require that we recognize compensation expense for all new and unvested share based payment awards from the effective date 
based on our preliminary analysis of sfas no 
r  we anticipate the after tax impact of adoption on our results of operations for the six months ending december   will be an expense of approximately million 
during fiscal year  we adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 application of issue no 
by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers  which amends eitf no 
according to the amended guidance  if certain criteria are met  consideration received by a reseller in the form of reimbursement from a vendor for honoring the vendor s sales incentives offered directly to consumers ie  manufacturers coupons should not be recorded as a reduction of the cost of the reseller s purchases from the vendor 
the adoption of eitf no 
did not materially impact our results of operations  financial position or liquidity in fiscal year in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
the new statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
sfas requires that these items be recognized as current period charges and requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
cash flow and liquidity a summary of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities is outlined in the table below 
year ended december  in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flow operating activities in  cash flows provided by operating activities were million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
during the year ended december   increases in accounts receivable  consisting primarily of amounts due from our various vendors and third party service providers  used million in cash  compared to million provided in the prior year 
an increase in vendor and service provider receivables due to an increase in sales of wireless services resulted in a cash usage by accounts receivable in  while cash provided in was the result of reductions of vendor and service provider receivables and dealer receivables from increased collections and lower sales of satellite television hardware 
during the year ended december   increases in inventory used million in cash  compared to million provided during the increase in inventory since december   was primarily the result of abnormally low inventory levels during the holiday selling season of and additional inventory purchased to stock the new kiosk locations during the fourth quarter of typically  our annual cash requirements for pre seasonal inventory build up range between million and million 
the funding required for this build up comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating revenues 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents as of december   as a resource for our funding needs 
additional capital is available under our million dollar commercial paper program  which is supported by a bank credit facility that could be utilized in the event the commercial paper market is unavailable to us 
we currently do not expect the commercial paper market to become unavailable to us nor that  we will need to utilize our credit facility 
as of december   we had no commercial paper outstanding  nor had we utilized any of our credit facility 
during the year ended december   million more in cash was provided by accounts payable as a result of effective management of our payables in and an increase in inventory levels  when compared to the prior year 
cash flow investing activities cash used in investing activities in was million  compared to million and million used in and  respectively 
capital expenditures for and increased over  primarily due to the continued construction of our new corporate campus in and  while capital expenditures for were primarily for our retail store expansions and remodels and information systems upgrades 
we also had capital expenditures relating to retail stores and information systems in both and we anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements for will be approximately million to million 
although capital expenditures for will be about the same as  expenditures will occur in different areas 
company operated store remodels and relocations  approximately new sprint kiosks and updated information systems account for the majority of our anticipated capital expenditures 
see further discussion on our new corporate headquarters below in the section titled capital structure and financial condition 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of wireless retail  inc wri 
these assets included wireless kiosks and inventory located within sam s club retail locations 
the total purchase price was million 
see further discussion on our sam s club kiosk business above in the section titled overview 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
these cash and cash equivalents  along with cash generated from our net sales and operating revenues and  if necessary  from our credit facilities  are available to fund future capital expenditure needs 
cash flow financing activities cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
we used million for the repurchase of our common stock in and million and million for the repurchase of our common stock in and  respectively 
repurchases of common stock were made under our share repurchase and employee stock programs 
see the further discussion of our stock repurchase programs below in the section titled capital structure and financial condition 
the  and stock repurchases were partially funded by million  million and million  respectively  received from the sale of treasury stock to employee benefit plans and from stock option exercises 
the balance of capital to repurchase shares was obtained from cash generated from operations 
we received million from the sale and lease back of our former corporate technology center building during the second quarter of this transaction was recorded as a financing obligation due to responsibilities which we retain during the lease period 
additionally  our net borrowings decreased million in  compared to a slight increase in and a decrease of million in dividends paid  net of tax  in  and amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
this change in dividends paid over the last three years was affected by a dividend per share increase and yearly share repurchases  resulting in fewer shares outstanding 
free cash flow our free cash flow  defined as cash flows from operating activities less dividends paid and additions to property  plant and equipment  was million in  million in and million in the decrease in free cash flow in was the result of a cash usage in working capital components  primarily inventory 
the increase in free cash flow between and was the result of supply chain initiatives  including a greater focus on reducing inventory weeks of supply 
we expect free cash flow to be approximately million to million in the increase from is based substantially on the anticipated increase in cash generated from working capital  primarily from inventory reductions 
we believe free cash flow is an appropriate indication of our ability to fund share repurchases  repay maturing debt  change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management believes will enhance shareholder value 
the comparable financial measure to free cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is cash flows from operating activities  which were million in  million in and million in we do not intend the presentation of free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
the following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow 
year ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment dividends paid free cash flow capital structure and financial condition we consider our financial structure and condition to be sound 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents at december   as a resource for our funding needs 
additionally  borrowings are available under our million commercial paper program  which is supported by bank credit facilities and can be utilized in the event the commercial paper market becomes unavailable to us 
however  we currently expect that the commercial paper market would be available to us  thus we do not expect to utilize our credit facilities 
as of december   we had no commercial paper outstanding and had not utilized our credit facilities 
debt obligations debt ratings our debt is considered investment grade by the rating agencies 
below are the agencies latest ratings by category  as well as their respective current outlook for the ratings 
standard category moody s and poor s fitch senior unsecured debt baa a bbb commercial paper p a f outlook stable stable stable factors that can impact our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance  the economic environment  conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries  our financial position and changes in our business strategy 
we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded 
if a downgrade were to occur  it could adversely impact  among other things  our future borrowing costs  access to capital markets  vendor financing terms and future new store occupancy costs 
our senior unsecured debt primarily consists of two issuances of year long term notes and an issuance of medium term notes 
long term notes we have a million debt shelf registration statement which became effective in august in august  we issued million of year unsecured long term notes under this shelf registration 
the interest rate on the notes is per annum with interest payable on september and march of each year 
these notes are due september  on may   we issued million of year notes in a private offering to initial purchasers who in turn offered the notes to qualified institutional buyers under sec rule a 
the annual interest rate on the notes is per annum with interest payable on november and may of each year 
the notes mature on may  in august  under the terms of an exchange offering filed with the sec  we exchanged substantially all of these notes for a similar amount of publicly registered notes 
because no additional debt was issued in the exchange offering  the net effect of this exchange was that no additional debt was issued  and substantially all of the notes were registered with the sec 
during the third quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with underlying notional amount of million with a maturity in in june and august  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with underlying notional amounts of debt of million and million  respectively  and both with maturities in may these swaps effectively convert a portion of our long term fixed rate debt to a variable rate 
we entered into these agreements to balance our fixed versus floating rate debt portfolio to continue to take advantage of lower short term interest rates 
under these agreements  we have contracted to pay a variable rate of libor plus a markup and to receive a fixed rate of for the swap entered into in and for the swaps entered into in we have designated these agreements as fair value hedging instruments 
medium term notes we also issued  in various amounts and on various dates from december through september  medium term notes totaling million under the shelf registration described above 
at december   million of these notes remained outstanding 
the interest rate at december   for the outstanding million in medium term notes was 
these notes have a maturity in as of december   there was no availability under this shelf registration 
available financing commercial paper we have access to short term debt instruments  such as commercial paper issuances  which are available to supplement our short term financing needs 
the commercial paper program  when utilized  has a typical maturity of days or less 
the amount of commercial paper that can be outstanding is limited to a maximum of the unused portion of our million revolving credit facilities described in more detail below 
we currently have no commercial paper outstanding 
credit facilities in the second quarter of  we replaced our existing million day revolving credit facility with a new five year credit facility maturing in june the terms of this revolving credit facility are substantially similar to the previous facility 
this credit facility  in addition to our existing million five year credit facility  which expires in june  will support our commercial paper borrowings and is otherwise available for general corporate purposes 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities 
our outstanding debt and bank syndicated credit facilities have customary covenants  and we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  management believes that our present ability to borrow is greater than our established credit lines and long term debt in place 
however  if market conditions change and sales were to dramatically decline or we could not control operating costs  our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced 
additionally  if a scenario as described above occurred  it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings  thereby increasing our borrowing costs  or even causing a reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and or equity markets 
dividends we have paid common stock cash dividends for years 
on september   our board of directors declared an annual dividend of per common share 
the dividend was paid on december   to shareholders of record on december  the dividend payment of million was funded from cash on hand 
operating leases we use operating leases  primarily for our retail locations and two distribution centers  to lower our capital requirements 
share repurchases we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million during the year ended december   under our share repurchase program 
we intend to execute share repurchases from time to time in order to take advantage of attractive share price levels  as determined by management 
the timing and terms of these transactions depend on market conditions  our liquidity and other considerations 
in february  our board of directors authorized a repurchase program for million shares  which was in addition to our million share repurchase program that was completed during the second quarter of at february   there were million shares available to be repurchased under this million share repurchase program 
the million share repurchase program has no expiration date and allows shares to be repurchased in the open market 
on february   our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program 
this new program allows management to repurchase up to million in open market purchases and has no expiration date 
we anticipate that we will repurchase  under our authorized repurchase programs  between million and million of our common stock during the funding required for these share repurchase programs will come from cash generated from net sales and operating revenues and cash and cash equivalents 
we will also repurchase shares in the open market to offset the sales of shares to our employee benefit plans 
construction of corporate headquarters in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of  we sold our former corporate headquarters buildings 
we entered into sale leaseback agreements in which our former corporate headquarters land and buildings were sold and leased back to us 
these arrangements provided us with the necessary time to construct our new headquarters  which we began partially occupying during the fourth quarter of our total campus costs are estimated to be million  with completion expected during the first quarter of capitalization the following table sets forth information about our capitalization at the dates indicated 
december  of total of total in millions dollars capitalization dollars capitalization current debt long term debt total debt stockholders equity total capitalization   our debt to total capitalization ratio decreased in from  due primarily to an increase in equity of million from long term debt as a percentage of total capitalization decreased in due to a decrease in long term debt  as current maturities of our outstanding notes moved to the short term debt classification  as well as the increase in equity of million from treasury stock on december   our board of directors approved the retirement of million shares of our common stock held as treasury stock 
these shares returned to the status of authorized and unissued 
see our consolidated statement of stockholders equity for additional details of this transaction 
contractual and credit commitments the following tables  as well as the information contained in note indebtedness and borrowing facilities to our notes to consolidated financial statements  provide a summary of our various contractual commitments  debt and interest repayment requirements  and available credit lines 
the table below contains our known contractual commitments as of december  in millions payments due by period total amounts less than contractual obligations committed year years years over years long term debt obligations interest obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total  purchase obligations include our product commitments  marketing agreements and freight commitments 
for more information regarding long term debt and lease commitments  refer to notes and  respectively  of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table below contains our credit commitments from various financial institutions 
in millions commitment expiration per period total amounts less than credit commitments committed year years years over years lines of credit stand by letters of credit total commercial commitments we have contingent liabilities related to retail leases of locations which were assigned to other businesses 
the majority of these contingent liabilities relate to various lease obligations arising from leases that were assigned to compusa  inc as part of the sale of our computer city  inc 
subsidiary to compusa  inc in august in the event compusa or the other assignees  as applicable  are unable to fulfill their obligations  we would be responsible for rent due under the leases 
our rent exposure from the remaining undiscounted lease commitments with no projected sublease income is approximately million 
however  we have no reason to believe that compusa or the other assignees will not fulfill their obligations under these leases or that we would be unable to sublet the properties  consequently  we do not believe there will be a material impact on our financial statements from any fulfillment of these contingencies 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases described above  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  transactions  or special purpose entities 
inflation inflation has not significantly impacted us over the past three years 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our operations in the foreseeable future  unless international events substantially affect the global economy 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals gaap in the united states 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by management judgment and uncertainties 
our estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are revenue recognition  inventory valuation under the cost method  estimation of reserves and valuation allowances  specifically related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies  and valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill 
we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and is material to the portrayal of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the selection  application and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived principally from the sale of private label and third party branded products and services to consumers 
revenue is recognized  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain products  such as wireless telephones and satellite systems  require the customer to use the services of a third party service provider 
in most cases  the third party service provider pays us a fee or commission for obtaining a new customer  as well as a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service provider and the customer 
fee or commission revenue  net of a reserve for estimated service deactivations  is generally recognized at the time the customer is accepted as a subscriber of a third party service provider 
estimated product refunds and returns  service plan deactivations  residual revenue and commission revenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to these items 
if actual results differ from these estimates due to various factors  the amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected 
a difference in our reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and operating revenues by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  inventory valuation our inventory consists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retail locations or within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower of average cost or expected sales price ie  market value 
the cost components recorded within inventory are the vendor invoice cost and certain allocated external and internal freight  distribution  warehousing and other costs required to transport the merchandise from the vendor to the point of sale  usually a store 
typically  the market value of our inventory is higher than its cost 
determination of the market value may be very complex and  therefore  requires a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value  the following items are commonly considered inventory turnover statistics  current selling prices  seasonality factors  consumer trends  competitive pricing  performance of similar products or accessories  planned promotional incentives  and estimated costs to sell or dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions 
if the calculated market value is determined to be less than the recorded average cost  a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item 
differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing of our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amount recorded at the financial statement date  and could also cause fluctuations in the amount of recorded cost of products sold 
if our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumer demand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to material losses or gains in excess of our established valuation reserve 
estimation of reserves and valuation allowances the amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use our past history and experience  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims  in evaluating the amount of liability that we should record 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate 
these revisions could materially impact our results of operations and financial position or liquidity 
we are insured for certain losses related to workers compensation  property and other liability claims  with deductibles up to million per occurrence 
this insurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that may arise above the deductible 
we also have a self insured health program administered by a third party covering the majority of our employees that participate in our health insurance programs 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting period 
this estimate is based on information provided by either an independent actuarial firm or third party 
the information includes historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors  and other factors we deem relevant 
a change in our insurance reserves at december   would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  as of december   actual losses had not exceeded our expectations 
we are subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax  sales and use tax  personal property tax  and other forms of taxes 
these audits examine our tax positions  timing of income and deductions  and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions 
as part of our evaluation of these tax issues  we establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures 
depending on the nature of the tax issue  it could be subject to audit over several years  therefore  our estimated reserve balances might exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority 
additionally  we are involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters 
a reserve has been established based on our best estimates of the potential liability in these matters 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
although we believe that our tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates  actual results could differ which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods 
these actual results could materially affect our effective tax rate  earnings  deferred tax balances and cash in the period of resolution 
valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets contained in our financial statements may not be recoverable 
our evaluation of potential impairment involves comparing the carrying value of the asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
the fair value is determined by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset will generate 
if the fair value calculated is less than the carrying value  we calculate the discounted cash flows of the asset and record an impairment loss 
the impairment loss is the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset and is recorded as a charge to earnings in the period the impairment occurs 
the carrying value of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value  and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded 
additionally  if it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased  the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new carrying value of the asset 
the impairment calculation requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning the future cash flows  strategic plans  useful life and discount rates 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to additional impairment charges which could be material to our results of operations 
we have acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable intangibles related to business acquisitions that have occurred during the current and prior years 
the original valuation of these intangibles is typically performed by a third party appraiser and may include the use of estimates that we provide concerning future profitability  cash flows and other judgmental factors 
we review our goodwill and intangible balances on an annual basis  typically near our fiscal year end  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or intangibles might exceed their current fair value 
the determination of fair value is based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow and other comparable market analyses 
these valuation techniques require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future profitability  industry factors  planned strategic initiatives  discount rates and others factors 
if actual results or performance of certain business units are different from our estimates  we may be exposed to an impairment charge related to our goodwill or intangibles 
the total value of our goodwill and intangibles at december   was million 
factors that may affect future results matters discussed in md a and in other parts of this report include forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these matters include statements concerning management s plans and objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and related assumptions 
we specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the information set forth in this report  including any forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are made based on management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and  therefore  involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
management cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees  and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause our actual results of operations or financial condition to differ materially include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following factors 
general business factors o changes in national or regional us economic conditions  including  but not limited to  recessionary or inflationary trends  equity market levels  consumer credit availability  interest rates  consumers disposable income and spending levels  continued rise of oil prices  job security and unemployment  and overall consumer confidence  o changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity exerted by current competitors and potential new competition from both retail stores and alternative methods or channels of distribution  such as e commerce  telephone shopping services and mail order  o any potential tariffs imposed on products that we import from china  as well as the potential strengthening of china s currency against the us dollar  o continuing terrorist activities in the us  as well as the international war on terrorism  o the disruption of international  national or regional transportation systems  o the lack of availability or access to sources of inventory  o changes in the financial markets that would reduce or eliminate our access to longer term capital or short term credit availability  o the imposition of new restrictions or regulations regarding the products and or services we sell or changes in tax rules and regulations applicable to us  and o the occurrence of severe weather events or natural disasters which could significantly damage or destroy outlets or prohibit consumers from traveling to our retail locations  especially during the peak holiday shopping season 
radioshack specific factors o the inability to successfully execute our solutions strategy to dominate cost effective solutions to meet everyone s routine electronics needs and families distinct electronics wants  o the failure to differentiate ourselves as an electronics specialty retailer in the us marketplace  o the failure to maintain or increase the level of sales in our non wireless business categories  o any reductions or changes in the growth rate of the wireless industry and changes in the wireless communications industry dynamics  including the effects of industry consolidation  o the inability to create  maintain or renew profitable contracts or execute business plans with providers of third party branded products and with service providers relating to cellular and pcs telephones which could cause the reduction or elimination of our commissions as well as residual income  o the presence or absence of new services or products and product features in the merchandise categories we sell and unexpected changes in our actual merchandise sales mix  o the inability to effectively manage our inventory levels in a rapidly changing marketplace  o the inability to attract  retain and grow an effective management team in a dynamic environment or changes in the cost or availability of a suitable workforce to manage and support our operating strategies  o the inability to optimize and execute our strategic plans  including our retail services operations and other sales channels  o the existence of contingent lease obligations related to our discontinued retail operations arising from an assignee s or a sub lessee s failure to fulfill its lease commitments  or from our inability to identify suitable sub lessees for vacant facilities  o the inability to successfully identify and analyze emerging growth opportunities in the areas of strategic business alliances  acquisitions  licensing opportunities  new markets  non store sales channels  and innovative products  and o the inability to successfully identify and enter into relationships with developers of new technologies or the failure of these new technologies to be adopted by the market 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we did not have any derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates  foreign currency rates  commodity prices or other market price risks  other than the interest rate swaps noted in our md a discussion 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short term interest rates 
interest rate risk exists with respect to our net investment at december   of million  comprised of fluctuating short term investments of million and offset by million of indebtedness which  because of our interest rate swaps  effectively bears interest at short term floating rates 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in the interest rate applicable to this floating rate net exposure would result in a decrease in annual net interest expense of million 
this assumption assumes no change in the net principal balance 
we also manage our portfolio of fixed rate debt to reduce our exposure to interest rate changes 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to long term interest rate changes 
interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt due to differences between market interest rates and rates at the inception of the debt obligation 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would decrease million and million  respectively 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point decrease in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would increase by million and million  respectively 
regarding the fair value of our fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates have no impact on our consolidated financial statements
