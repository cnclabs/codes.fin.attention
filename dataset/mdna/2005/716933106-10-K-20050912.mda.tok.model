actual results could differ materially from any future performance suggested in this report as a result of the risks  uncertainties and other factors described herein and elsewhere in this report  including those discussed in risk factors 
overview pharmacyclics is a pharmaceutical company focused on the development of products that improve existing therapeutic approaches to cancer  atherosclerosis and other diseases 
to date  substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the research and development of our products  and we have not generated any commercial revenues from the sale of our products 
we do not expect to generate any product revenues until we receive the necessary regulatory and marketing approvals and launch one of our products  if at all 
we have two primary drug products  or research and development programs  on which we are currently focusing our efforts xcytrin and antrin 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in  and as of june   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the process of developing and commercializing our products requires significant research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  manufacturing arrangements as well as regulatory and marketing approvals 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in significant operating losses until the commercialization of our products generates sufficient revenues to cover our expenses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
our achieving profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to successfully complete the development of our products under development  and obtain required regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products 
xcytrin  our lead product candidate  is an anti cancer agent being evaluated in various clinical situations 
we have completed a pivotal randomized phase trial of xcytrin for the potential treatment of lung cancer patients with brain metastases 
this randomized controlled study  known as the smart study of neurologic progression with motexafin gadolinium and radiation therapy trial  enrolled patients  and we plan to announce results from this trial by the end of calendar the trial will compare the effects of whole brain radiation therapy wbrt alone to wbrt plus xcytrin in lung cancer patients with brain metastases 
the primary efficacy endpoint will be time to neurologic progression as determined by a blinded events review committee 
survival and neurocognitive function will also be assessed as secondary endpoints of the trial 
we requested and received a special protocol assessment from the fda for the smart trial 
special protocol assessment provides for sponsors of clinical trials to receive official fda evaluation  guidance and agreement on pivotal trials that will form the basis for final approval 
our strategy is to evaluate xcytrin for the treatment of a diverse range of cancer types and in various clinical situations including xcytrin as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and or radiation therapy 
we have begun phase clinical trials with xcytrin used alone to treat lung cancer and to treat hematologic cancers such as lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
we also are conducting phase clinical trials with xcytrin used alone for kidney cancer and in combination with stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of brain metastases 
phase trials are underway evaluating xcytrin given in combination with taxotere for lung  prostate  ovarian and breast cancer 
we also completed a phase clinical trial with antrin angiophototherapy for the treatment of coronary artery disease in patients receiving balloon angioplasty and stents 
this study was primarily designed to evaluate the safety of various doses of drug and light 
results of this trial were published in the september issue of the journal circulation 
seventy nine patients were treated on this protocol  which demonstrated the safety and feasibility of antrin angiophototherapy and determined optimum doses of drug and light for future trials 
no major treatment related angiographic or biochemical adverse effects or abnormalities were observed and no dose limiting toxicities were noted 
no instances of emergency coronary artery bypass  death  stroke or myocardial infarction occurred in patients who received both antrin infusion and endovascular illumination and activation of the drug 
the most frequently reported side effects were mild  transient rash and reversible mild tingling in the hands and feet  some of which lasted days to weeks  but did not require clinical intervention 
we are subject to risks common to pharmaceutical companies developing products  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  uncertainty of market acceptance of our products  history of and expectation of future operating losses  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  and the need for future capital 
in order for a product to be commercialized  we must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for our products from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and clinical trial accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonable assured 
license revenue is typically recognized over the term of the arrangement and milestone revenue is recognized when earned as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestone and the absence of any on going obligation 
license  milestone  contract and grant revenues are not subject to repayment 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenues 
cash equivalents and marketable securities we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
at june   all other investment securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
management assesses whether declines in the fair value of investment securities are other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  management considers the following factors length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
to date we have had no declines in fair value that have been identified as other than temporary 
research and development expenses and accruals research and development expenses include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for clinical trials  manufacturing and process development  research and other consulting activities  costs are expensed upon the earlier of when non refundable amounts are due or as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
recent accounting pronouncements at its march meeting  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the consensus clarifies the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method 
the recognition and measurement guidance for which the consensus was reached is to be applied to other than temporary impairment evaluations 
in september  the fasb issued a final fasb staff position  fsp eitf issue  that delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance of eitf we do not believe that this consensus on the recognition and measurement guidance will have an impact on our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards r sfas r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and this revised standard addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
under the new standard  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb instead  companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the expense in the statement of operations 
sfas r will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after june  we will be required to implement sfas r in the quarter that begins july  the company has not yet determined which fair value method and transitional provision it will follow and thus has not determined the impact on its financial statements 
results of operations comparison of years ended june   and revenues 
we had no revenues for the years ended june   and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the  increase from to was primarily due to an increase in personnel and consulting costs to support clinical activities  partially offset by a reduction in depreciation and rent expense 
the  increase from to was primarily due to an increase in third party clinical trial costs offset by reduced personnel costs related to lower average headcount and reduced facility costs 
research and development costs are identified as either directly attributed to one of our research and development programs or as an indirect cost  with only direct costs being tracked by specific program 
direct costs consist of personnel costs directly associated with a program  preclinical study costs  clinical trial costs  and related clinical drug and device development and manufacturing costs  drug formulation costs  contract services and other research expenditures 
indirect costs consist of personnel costs not directly associated with a program  overhead and facility costs and other support service expenses 
prior to  we did not track our historical research and development costs by specific program and for this reason we cannot accurately estimate our total historical costs on a specific program basis 
direct costs by program and indirect costs are as follows related r d expenses years ended june  estimated phase of completio n product description development of phase xcytrin cancer several phase trials unknown several phase trials unknown phase fiscal antrin coronary artery disease phase completed other total direct costs indirect costs total research and development costs research and development expenses increased  or for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   and were comprised of the following xcytrin program costs increased  or  primarily due to an increase in third party clinical trial costs and related clinical trial activities of  as we continued enrollment in our phase smart trial and several other phase and phase trials 
an increase in employee costs of  as we allocated more employee resources to support our clinical trials 
antrin program costs increased  or  due to an increase in employee costs  partially offset by slightly lower pre clinical study costs 
indirect costs decreased  or  primarily due to a decrease in facility costs  due to a decrease in building space leased and a decrease in depreciation due to a smaller asset base 
a decrease in employee costs  as we focused our resources on supporting the xcytrin clinical trials 
research and development expenses increased  or  for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   and were comprised of the following xcytrin program costs increased  or  primarily due to an increase in third party clinical trial costs of  as we continued to increase enrollment in our phase smart trial and we initiated several other phase and phase trials 
an increase in employee costs of  as we allocated more employee resources to support our clinical trials 
an increase in drug costs of  to support our on going and new clinical trials 
antrin program costs decreased  or 
in we continued to reduce spending on our antrin program and allocated these resources to the xcytrin program 
this resulted in a decrease in employee costs  partially offset by slightly higher pre clinical study costs indirect costs decreased  or  primarily due to a decrease in facility costs  due to the decrease in building space leased and the decrease in depreciation due to a smaller asset base 
a decrease in employee costs  as we focused its resources on supporting the xcytrin clinical trials 
we expect research and development costs to increase in the future as a result of increased clinical development and manufacturing costs primarily related to our xcytrin product 
the timing and amount of these costs will depend on the outcome of our ongoing and future clinical trials  regulatory requirements and product manufacturing costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the years ended june   and were   and  respectively 
the  increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased personnel and consulting expenses  to support our business and an increase in third party costs associated with pre commercial marketing activities 
the  decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower facility costs  as a result of a decrease in building space leased and a decrease in depreciation due to a smaller asset base 
we expect future general and administrative expenses to increase in support of expanded business activities including costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts to support our commercialization strategy for xcytrin 
interest and other  net 
interest and other  net  was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the increase in the year ended june  was primarily due to higher interest rates earned on greater cash balances 
the decrease in the year ended june  was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on lower cash balances 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of fixed rate instruments 
income taxes 
at june   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal reporting purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through under the tax reform act of  the amounts of and the benefit from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be carried forward may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
these circumstances include  but are not limited to  a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than  as defined  over a three year period 
such an annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
a full valuation allowance has been established for the company s deferred tax assets since realization of such assets through the generation of future taxable income is uncertain 
see note of notes to financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of working capital since inception have been private and public equity financings and proceeds from collaborative research and development agreements  as well as interest income 
since inception  we have used approximately  of cash for operating activities and approximately  of cash for the purchase of laboratory and office equipment  leasehold improvements  and payments under capital lease agreements 
as of june   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
net cash used in operating activities was   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively  and resulted primarily from operating losses adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  prepaid expenses and other assets 
net cash provided by used by investing activities of   and  in the years ended june   and  respectively  primarily consisted of the net effect of purchases  maturities and sales of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities of   and  in the years ended june   and  respectively  primarily consisted of proceeds from the sale of common stock  the exercise of stock options and the sale of stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
in february  we filed a registration statement on form s to offer and sell  from time to time  equity  debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of million 
in april  we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share in an underwritten public offering pursuant to this registration statement 
we received approximately  in net proceeds from the issuance of the  shares 
we may seek to raise funds through additional public offerings in the future but cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful 
our future contractual obligations at june  are as follows operating lease purchase commitments commitments fiscal   fiscal  fiscal  total minimum lease payments   represents a purchase commitment for a drug substance intermediate 
non cancelable operating lease expires in fiscal based upon the current status of our product development and commercialization plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the next twelve months 
we expect the increases in research and development expenses as a result of on going and future clinical trials to consume a large portion of our existing cash resources 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
in any event  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in the future 
we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private financings  collaborative relationships partnerships with other drug manufacturers or other arrangements to complete commercialization 
our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the progress and success of clinical trials of our product candidates  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to establish and the scope of any new collaborations  and the timing and scope of commercialization expenses for xcytrin 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
the factors described above will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
if we are required to raise additional funds  we cannot be certain that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to existing stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see risk factors we will need additional financing and we may have difficulty raising needed capital in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than two years 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of june  would have potentially declined by  the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of stated maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands  except interest rates fiscal year fair value total at june  marketable securities     weighted average interest rate
