item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  reinsurance  for further discussion 
cna surety s largest reinsurance receivable from an affiliate  ccc  an a rated company by am best  was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  due to the nature of the reinsurance products available to the company and other sureties  reinsurers may cover principals for whom the company writes surety bonds in one year  but then exclude or provide only limited reinsurance for these same principals in subsequent years 
as a result  the company may continue to have exposure to these principals with limited or no reinsurance for bonds written during years that the company had reinsurance covering these principals 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses the company retains an independent actuarial firm of national standing to perform periodic actuarial analysis of the company s loss reserves 
this analysis is based on a variety of techniques that involve detailed statistical analysis of past reporting  settlement activity  and salvage and subrogation activity  as well as claim frequency and severity data when sufficient information exists to lend statistical credibility to the analysis 
the analysis may be based upon internal loss experience or industry experience 
techniques may vary depending on the type of claim being estimated 
while techniques may vary  each employs significant judgments and assumptions 
the independent actuarial firm provides annually actuarial certification as to the reasonableness of actuarial assumptions used and the sufficiency of year end reserves for each of the company s principal insurance subsidiaries 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses includes  on an undiscounted basis  estimates of a the ultimate settlement value of reported claims  b incurred but not reported ibnr claims  c future expenses to be incurred in the settlement of claims and d claim recoveries  exclusive of reinsurance recoveries which are reported as an asset 
these estimates are determined based on the company s and surety industry loss experience as well as consideration of current trends and conditions 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is an estimate and there is the potential that actual future loss payments will differ significantly from initial estimates 
the methods of determining such estimates and the resulting estimated liability are regularly reviewed and updated 
changes in the estimated liability are reflected in operating income in the period in which such changes are determined to be needed 
a table is included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses  that presents the activity in the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for the company and is incorporated herein by reference 
this table highlights the impact of revisions to the estimated liability established in prior years 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of the consolidated loss reserves reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and the reserves reported to state insurance regulatory authorities in accordance with statutory accounting practices sap as of december  dollars in thousands net reserves at end of year  gaap basis  ceded reinsurance  net of salvage and subrogation  gross reserves at end of year  gaap basis  estimated reinsurance recoverable netted against gross reserves for sap  net reserves on retroactive reinsurance assumed  net reserves at end of year  sap basis  the following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of reserves established for the company s estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses at the end of various calendar years 
the first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year 
the second section shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability 
the third section shows re estimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of management s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the last section compares the latest re estimated reserve to the reserve originally established  and indicates whether or not the original reserve was adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims 
the loss reserve development table is cumulative as of each december  and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years 
the loss reserve development table reflects  on a pro forma basis  the reserves of the ccc surety operations and capsure since and cic since its acquisition in may of such historical development is not necessarily indicative of the financial results that would have occurred under the ownership and management of cna surety or of future operating results

the company maintains an experienced and dedicated staff of in house claim specialists 
claim handling for the company s contract and large commercial account business is performed in chicago 
claims for the company s small commercial bonds and the related fidelity bonds and e o insurance are handled in sioux falls 
the disposition of claims and other claim related activity is done in accordance with established policies  procedures and expense controls designed to minimize loss costs and maximize salvage and subrogation recoveries 
indemnity and subrogation rights exist on a significant portion of the business written  enabling the company to pursue loss recovery from the principal 
environmental claims the company does not typically bond contractors that specialize in hazardous environmental remediation work 
the company does however bond several accounts that have incidental environmental exposure with respect to which the company provides bonding programs 
in the commercial surety market  the company provides bonds to large corporations that are in the business of mining various minerals and are obligated to post reclamation bonds that guarantee that property which was disturbed during mining is returned to an acceptable condition when the mining is completed 
the company also provides court and other surety bonds for large corporations wherein the underlying action involves environmental related issues 
while no environmental responsibility is overtly provided by commercial or contract bonds  some risk of environmental exposure may exist if the surety were to assume certain rights in the completion of a defaulted project or through salvage recovery 
the company estimates its net case incurred losses on known claims of this nature to be million as of december  regulation the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they transact business under statutes that delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance regulators 
in general  an insurer s state of domicile has principal responsibility for such regulation which is designed generally to protect policyholders rather than investors and relates to matters such as the standards of solvency which must be maintained  the licensing of insurers and their agents  the examination of the affairs of insurance companies  including periodic financial and market conduct examinations  the filing of annual and other reports  prepared on a statutory basis  on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes  establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums and losses  and requirements regarding numerous other matters 
licensed or admitted insurers generally must file with the insurance regulators of such states  or have filed on its behalf  the premium rates and bond and policy forms used within each state 
in some states  approval of such rates and forms must be received from the insurance regulators in advance of their use 
western surety is domiciled in south dakota and licensed in all states and the district of columbia and puerto rico 
surety bonding is domiciled in south dakota and licensed in states and the district of columbia 
usa is domiciled in texas and licensed in states and the district of columbia 
insurance regulations generally also require registration and periodic disclosure of certain information concerning ownership  financial condition  capital structure  general business operations and any material transactions or agreements by or among affiliates 
such regulation also typically restricts the ability of any one person to acquire or more  either directly or indirectly  of a company s stock without prior approval of the applicable insurance regulatory authority 
in addition  dividends and other distributions to stockholders generally may be paid only out of unreserved and unrestricted statutory earned surplus 
such distributions may be subject to prior regulatory approval  including a review of the implications on risk based capital requirements 
a discussion of risk based capital requirements for property and casualty insurance companies is included in both management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  statutory financial data 
without prior regulatory approval in  cna surety s insurance subsidiaries may pay stockholder dividends of million in the aggregate 
for the year ended december   cna surety received no dividends from its insurance subsidiaries 
cna surety s insurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic financial and market conduct examinations 
these examinations are generally performed by the domiciliary state insurance regulatory authorities 
during  both the south dakota department of commerce and regulation insurance division and the texas department of insurance issued their respective reports of examination for the five year period ended december  the points noted in their reviews were largely administrative in nature and have been addressed by management 
in connection with an examination of the insurance subsidiaries of cnaf undertaken by the illinois department of insurance in  both the south dakota department of commerce and regulation insurance division and the texas department of insurance initiated financial examinations as of december  of western surety  surety bonding  and usa 
the review of usa is currently in progress 
the review of western surety and surety bonding was completed on january  the points noted in these reviews were largely administrative in nature and are being addressed by management 
the points noted do not have a material impact on the insurance subsidiaries statutory surplus  nor have they resulted in any fines or penalties to cna surety or any of its subsidiaries 
the report did address the company s exposure to the large national contractor discussed later that had previously been discussed with the regulators 
the company has agreed to provide the regulators with an ongoing update and review of this exposure 
certain states in which cna surety s insurance subsidiaries conduct their business require insurers to join a guaranty association 
guaranty associations provide protection to policyholders of insurers licensed in such states against the insolvency of those insurers 
in order to provide the associations with funds to pay certain claims under policies issued by insolvent insurers  the guaranty associations charge members assessments based on the amount of direct premiums written in that state 
such assessments were not material to cna surety s results of operations in western surety and surety bonding each qualifies as an acceptable surety for federal and other public works project bonds pursuant to us department of treasury regulations 
us treasury underwriting limitations are based on an insurer s statutory surplus 
the underwriting limitations of western surety and surety bonding  based on each insurer s statutory surplus  were million and million  respectively  for the twelve month period ended june  effective july  through june   the underwriting limitations of western surety and surety bonding are million and million  respectively 
through the surety quota share treaty between ccc and western surety company  cna surety has access to ccc and its affiliates us department of treasury underwriting limitations 
the surety quota share treaty had an original term of five years from the merger date and was renewed on october  and on january  on substantially the same terms 
effective july  through june   the underwriting limitations of ccc and its affiliates total million 
cna surety management believes that the foregoing us treasury underwriting limitations are sufficient for the conduct of its business 
investments cna surety insurance subsidiaries investment practices must comply with insurance laws and regulations and must also comply with certain covenants under cna surety s credit facility 
generally  insurance laws and regulations prescribe the nature and quality of  and set limits on  the various types of investments that may be made by cna surety s insurance subsidiaries 
the company s investment portfolio generally is managed to maximize after tax investment return  while minimizing credit risk with investments concentrated in high quality income securities 
cna surety s portfolio is managed to provide diversification by limiting exposures to any one industry  issue or issuer  and to provide liquidity by investing in the public securities markets 
the portfolio is structured to support cna surety s insurance underwriting operations and to consider the expected duration of liabilities and short term cash needs 
an investment committee of cna surety s board of directors establishes investment policy and oversees the management of each portfolio 
a professional independent investment adviser has been engaged to assist in the management of each insurance subsidiary investment portfolio pursuant to established investment committee guidelines

the adoption of this standard eliminated the company s amortization of goodwill and intangibles after december  and therefore  increased the company s reported net income by million  or cents per share  respectively  as compared to the same period in if the provisions of this standard were applied to prior periods  net income for the years ended december  and would have been million or per share  and million or per share  respectively 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of cna surety corporation cna surety or company and its subsidiaries operating results  liquidity and capital resources  and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of cna surety and notes thereto 
introduction management believes that the following areas represent the most significant risks and uncertainties impacting the operating performance and financial condition of the company 
the financial impacts of these issues would affect gross and net written premium  incurred losses and reserves for unpaid losses 
each of these issues is discussed in greater detail later in this section 
exposure to loss on principals excluded from reinsurance programs beginning in  the company s unaffiliated reinsurers excluded certain accounts for which the company had continuing exposure from bonds written in prior years from the reinsurance programs 
for these accounts  the company would retain up to million of loss 
due to the improved financial condition of some of these accounts and the company s efforts to have these accounts covered  only one remains excluded from the reinsurance program 
this account is a large national contractor that is discussed in detail on page availability and cost of reinsurance reinsurance coverage is an important component of the company s capital structure 
reinsurance allows the company to meet certain regulatory restrictions that would otherwise limit the size of bonds that the company writes and limit the market segments in which the company could compete 
in addition  reinsurance reduces the potential volatility of earnings and protects the company s capital by limiting the amount of loss associated with any one bond principal 
due to increased loss frequency and severity for both the company and within the surety industry in general that began emerging in  the company  beginning in  paid substantially higher reinsurance premiums and was required to retain higher amounts of its per principal exposure 
through aggressive exposure reduction efforts and continued underwriting discipline  the company has been able to purchase additional limits and more expansive reinsurance protection for and  with substantial cost savings achieved for relative to the availability and cost of reinsurance protection for and beyond will depend on a number of factors such as the company s loss experience  the surety industry s loss experience  the number of reinsurers willing to provide coverage  and broader economic conditions 
financial strength ratings surety bond principals and obligees often refer to the financial strength ratings assigned by am best company  inc am best  standard and poor s s p and other similar companies when they are choosing a surety company 
because the company uses the underwriting capacity of continental casualty company ccc to serve larger accounts  the insurer financial strength rating of both the company and ccc factor into customers decisions 
after reporting a significant net loss in the third quarter of  the company s am best rating was lowered from a to a with a negative outlook 
ccc also reported a significant net loss in the third quarter of  but am best affirmed ccc s rating of a with a negative outlook 
management believes that the current ratings are sufficient for the company to conduct all aspects of its business 
management also believes that a one level reduction in ratings would have only a minimal impact on operations 
a further decrease beyond one level would likely have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to write business 
management believes that the likelihood of further ratings downgrades has been reduced by ongoing efforts to reduce large exposures  lower per principal retentions under the and reinsurance programs  the reduction in the number of principals excluded from reinsurance programs and increased statutory surplus and capital 
economic conditions the company s results of operations are impacted by general corporate credit conditions  as well as by the condition of the public construction segment of the economy 
corporate credit default rates have improved from the historically high levels of and  and the amount of new public construction spending appears to be strong 
an improvement in overall corporate default rates could be expected to have a favorable impact on the company s loss costs 
strong public construction spending could be expected to benefit the company s written premium production and loss costs 
changes in these factors could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the diversification of the company s book of business  with approximately of premium from products that are less sensitive to economic conditions  mitigates the impact of these economic factors 
bond premium rates the premium rates that the company charges for its bonds have a direct impact on the amount of revenue generated and on the ratio of incurred losses to earned premium 
over the last several years  the company has charged higher rates for its bonds  particularly in the large commercial and contract segments 
these two segments demonstrated the greater rate need due to the emergence of increased loss frequency and severity as noted above 
based on analysis of current competitive factors in the marketplace  the company does not expect to achieve significant rate increases  particularly in the small and middle market contract segments 
critical accounting policies management believes the most significant accounting policies and related disclosures for purposes of understanding the company s results of operations and financial condition pertain to reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance  investments  goodwill and other intangible assets  and deferred policy acquisition costs 
the company s accounting policies related to reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and related estimates of reinsurance recoverables  are particularly critical to an assessment of the company s financial results 
these balances are highly subjective and require management s most complex judgments because of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance cna surety accrues liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under its surety and property and casualty insurance contracts based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date 
reported claims are in various stages of the settlement process 
due to the nature of surety  which is the relationship among three parties whereby the surety guarantees the performance of the principal to a third party the obligee  the investigation of claims and the establishment of case estimates on claim files can be a complex process that can occur over a period of time depending on the type of bond s and the facts and circumstances involving the particular bond s  the claim s and the principal 
case reserves are typically established after a claim is filed and an investigation and analysis has been conducted as to the validity of the claim  the principal s response to the claim and the principal s financial viability 
to the extent it is determined that there are no bona fide defenses to the claim and the principal is unwilling or financially unable to resolve the claim  a case estimate is established on the claim file for the amount the company estimates it will have to pay to honor its obligations under the provisions of the bond s 
while the company intends to establish initial case reserve estimates that are sufficient to cover the ultimate anticipated loss on a file  some estimates need to be adjusted during the life cycle of the file as matters continue to develop 
factors that can necessitate case estimate increases or decreases are the complexity of the bond s and or underlying contract s  if additional and or unexpected claims are filed  if the financial condition of the principal or obligee changes or as claims develop and more information is discovered that was unknown and or unexpected at the time the initial case reserve estimate was established 
ultimately  claims are resolved through payment and or a determination that  based on the information available  a case reserve is no longer required 
as of any balance sheet date  not all claims have been reported and some claims may not be reported for many years 
as a result  the liability for unpaid losses includes significant estimates for incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
the following table shows the estimated liability as of december  for unpaid claims applicable to reported claims and to ibnr dollars in thousands for each sub line of business gross case loss gross ibnr loss total gross and lae reserves and lae reserves reserves contract    commercial    fidelity and other    total    the company retains an independent actuarial firm of national standing to perform periodic actuarial analysis of the company s loss reserves 
this analysis is based on a variety of techniques that involve detailed statistical analysis of past claim reporting  settlement activity  and salvage and subrogation activity  as well as claim frequency and severity data when sufficient information exists to lend statistical credibility to the analysis 
the analysis may be based upon internal loss experience or industry experience 
techniques may vary depending on the type of claim being estimated 
while techniques may vary  each employs significant judgments and assumptions 
this analysis results in both a range of reasonable loss reserve estimates as well as a point estimate of the indicated loss reserves 
surety results  especially for contract and certain commercial products like insurance program bonds  workers compensation insurance bonds and reclamation bonds  tend to be impacted by fewer  but more severe  losses 
with this type of loss experience  it is more difficult to estimate the required reserves  particularly for the most current accident years which may have few reported claims 
as a result  the range of reasonable loss reserve estimates may be broader than that associated with traditional property casualty insurance products 
the independent actuarial firm s analysis is the primary tool that management utilizes in determining its best estimate of loss reserves 
however  the carried reserve may differ from the independent actuarial firm s point estimate as a result of management s consideration of the impact of factors such as the following  especially as they relate to the current accident year current claim activity  including the frequency and severity of current claims changes in underwriting standards and business mix such as the company s efforts to reduce exposures to large commercial bonds changes in the claims handling process current economic conditions  especially corporate default rates and the condition of the construction economy management believes that the impact of the factors listed above  and others  may not be fully quantifiable through actuarial analysis 
accordingly  management may apply its judgment of the impact of these factors  and others  to its selection of the recorded loss reserves 
receivables recorded with respect to insurance losses ceded to reinsurers under reinsurance contracts are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for insurance losses and  therefore  are also subject to uncertainty 
in addition to the factors cited above  estimates of reinsurance recoveries may prove uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders 
the company s consolidated balance sheet includes estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of million and reinsurance receivables related to unpaid losses of million at december  compared to estimates of million and million  respectively  at december  at december   the range of reasonable loss reserve estimates  net of reinsurance receivables  calculated by the independent actuarial firm and adopted by management was from million to million 
ranges of reasonable loss reserve estimates are not calculated for the sub lines of business 
management believes that the range calculated over total reserves provides the most meaningful information due to the importance of correlation of losses between the sub lines of business related to the impact of general economic conditions 
due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  the actual ultimate claims amounts will differ from the currently recorded amounts 
this difference could have a material effect on reported earnings and financial condition 
future effects from changes in these estimates will be recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period such changes are determined to be needed 
investments management believes the company has the ability to hold all fixed income securities to maturity 
however  the company may dispose of securities prior to their scheduled maturity due to changes in interest rates  prepayments  tax and credit considerations  liquidity or regulatory capital requirements  or other similar factors 
as a result  the company considers all of its fixed income securities bonds and redeemable preferred stocks and equity securities as available for sale 
these securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of deferred income taxes  reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
cash flows from purchases  sales and maturities are reported gross in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement 
the amortized cost of fixed income securities is determined based on cost and the cumulative effect of amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization and accretion are included in investment income 
for mortgage backed and certain asset backed securities  the company recognizes income using the effective yield method based on estimated cash flows 
all securities transactions are recorded on the trade date 
investment gains or losses realized on the sale of securities are determined using the specific identification method 
investments with an other than temporary decline in value are written down to fair value  resulting in losses that are included in realized investment gains and losses 
short term investments that generally include us treasury bills  corporate notes  money market funds and investment grade commercial paper equivalents  are carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value 
invested assets are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate risk  market risk and credit risk 
due to the level of risk associated with invested assets and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of these assets  it is possible that changes in risks in the near term may materially affect the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income 
intangible assets cna surety s consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes intangible assets of million 
these amounts represent goodwill and identified intangibles with indefinite useful lives arising from the acquisition of capsure 
prior to  goodwill from this and other acquisitions were generally amortized as a charge to earnings over periods not exceeding years 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
entitled goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which was adopted by cna surety as of january   periodic amortization ceased  in accordance with an impairment only accounting model 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests 
such tests include periodically determining or reviewing the estimated fair value of cna surety s reporting units 
under sfas  fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold 
there are several methods of estimating fair value  including market quotations  asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the estimated fair value  then individual assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value 
the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of net assets would establish the implied value of goodwill 
the excess of the recorded amount of intangible assets over the implied value of intangible assets is recorded as an impairment loss 
deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs  consisting of commissions  premium taxes and other underwriting expenses which vary with  and are primarily related to  the production of business  net of reinsurance commissions  are deferred and amortized as a charge to income as the related premiums are earned 
the company periodically tests that deferred acquisition costs are recoverable based on the expected profitability embedded in the reserve for unearned premium 
if the expected profitability is less than the balance of deferred acquisition costs  a charge to net income is taken and the deferred acquisition cost balance is reduced to the amount determined to be recoverable 
anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs 
results of operations financial measures the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a discusses certain generally accepted accounting principles gaap and non gaap financial measures in order to provide information used by management to monitor the company s operating performance 
management utilizes various financial measures to monitor the company s insurance operations and investment portfolio 
underwriting results  which are derived from certain income statement amounts  are considered a non gaap financial measure and are used by management to monitor performance of the company s insurance operations 
the company s investment portfolio is monitored through analysis of various quantitative and qualitative factors and certain decisions related to the sale or impairment of investments produce realized gains and losses  which is also a component used in the calculation of net income and is a non gaap financial measure 
underwriting results are computed as net earned premiums less net loss and loss adjustment expenses and net commissions  brokerage and other underwriting expenses 
management uses underwriting results to monitor the results of its insurance operations without the impact of certain factors  including net investment income  net realized investment gains losses and interest expense 
management excludes these factors in order to analyze the direct relationship between net earned premiums and the related net loss and loss adjustment expenses along with net commissions  brokerage and other underwriting expenses 
operating ratios are calculated using insurance results and are widely used by the insurance industry and regulators such as state departments of insurance and the national association of insurance commissioners for financial regulation and as a basis of comparison among companies 
the ratios discussed in the company s md a are calculated using gaap financial results and include the net loss and loss adjustment expense ratio loss ratio as well as the net commissions  brokerage and other underwriting expense ratio expense ratio and combined ratio 
the loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums 
the expense ratio is the percentage of net commissions  brokerage and other underwriting expenses  including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs  to net earned premiums 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and expense ratios 
the company s investment portfolio is monitored by management through analyses of various factors including unrealized gains and losses on securities  portfolio duration  and exposure to interest rate  market and credit risk 
based on such analyses  the company may impair an investment security in accordance with its policy  or sell a security 
such activities will produce net realized investment gains and losses 
while management uses various gaap and non gaap financial measures to monitor various aspects of the company s performance  net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure and represents a more comprehensive measure of operating performance 
management believes that its process of evaluating performance through the use of these non gaap financial measures provides a basis for enhanced understanding of its operating performance and the impact to net income as a whole 
management also believes that investors may find these widely used financial measures described above useful in interpreting the underlying trends and performance  as well as to provide visibility into the significant components of net income 
comparison of cna surety actual results for the years ended december   and analysis of net income loss the company had net income of million for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december   and net income of million for the year ended december  the increase in reflects the absence of material adverse loss development which occurred during the third quarter of  higher net earned premium and higher net investment income  partially offset by higher expenses 
the decrease in compared to was driven by higher incurred losses and lower investment income 
analysis of the components of net income are discussed in the following sections 
results of insurance operations underwriting components for the company for the years ended december   and are summarized in the following table dollars in thousands years ended december  gross written premium    net written premium    net earned premium    net losses and loss adjustment expenses    net commissions  brokerage and other underwriting expenses    loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio premiums written cna surety primarily markets contract and commercial surety bonds 
contract surety bonds generally secure a contractor s performance and or payment obligation with respect to a construction project 
contract surety bonds are generally required by federal  state and local governments for public works projects

commercial surety bonds include all surety bonds other than contract and cover obligations typically required by law or regulation 
the commercial surety market includes numerous types of bonds categorized as court judicial  court fiduciary  public official  license and permit and many miscellaneous bonds that include guarantees of financial performance 
the company also writes fidelity bonds that cover losses arising from employee dishonesty and other insurance products that are generally companion products to certain surety bonds

the company assumes significant amounts of premiums primarily from affiliates 
this includes all surety business written or renewed  net of reinsurance  by ccc and cic  and their affiliates  after the merger date that is reinsured by western surety pursuant to reinsurance and related agreements 
because of certain regulatory restrictions that limit the company s ability to write business on a direct basis  the company continues to utilize the underwriting capacity available through these agreements 
the company is in full control of all aspects of the underwriting and claim management of the assumed business

excess of loss reinsurance the company s reinsurance program is predominantly comprised of excess of loss reinsurance contracts that limit the company s retention on a per principal basis 
at december   american reinsurance company  general reinsurance corporation  swiss reinsurance america corporation  and xl reinsurance corporation all rated at least a by am best were the four reinsurers from which the company had its largest reinsurance receivables 
third party reinsurance compared to third party reinsurance effective january   cna surety entered into a new excess of loss treaty excess of loss treaty with a group of third party reinsurers that reduced its net retention per principal to million with a co participation in the million layer of third party reinsurance coverage above the company s retention 
this new excess of loss treaty replaced the million excess of million per principal coverage  as well as the million excess of million per principal and the million excess of million coverage that had been provided by ccc 
the material differences between the excess of loss treaty excess of loss reinsurance program and the company s excess of loss treaty are as follows 
the annual aggregate coverage increased from million in to million in the premium for the excess of loss treaty was million net of expected return premium compared to a total of million of reinsurance premiums paid in net of expected return premium for the million excess of million  the million excess of million and the million excess of million treaties 
the contract also included an optional twelve month extended discovery period  for an additional premium a percentage of the original premium based on any unexhausted aggregate limit by layer  which would provide coverage for losses discovered in on bonds that were in force during the company did not elect to purchase the extended discovery period because it obtained coverage for under a new treaty 
the excess of loss treaty also provided for somewhat less restrictive special acceptance provisions for larger contract accounts than those contained in the excess of loss treaty 
in addition to the one large contract principal described later and the two commercial principals excluded based upon class of business  the company s reinsurers had excluded three other contract principals from the excess of loss treaty  for a total of six excluded principals 
the one large contract principal and the two commercial principals remained excluded from the excess of loss treaty 
of the two commercial principals  one is a domestic electric utility with an estimated bonded exposure of million and is currently rated b by s p 
this rating was increased from ccc during the third quarter of due to significant recapitalization efforts by the principal 
the bonded exposure will decline over the term of the bond which extends until the other commercial principal is a foreign industrial enterprise that fulfilled its bonded obligations in the second quarter of  so the company no longer has any exposure 
with respect to the three contract principals other than the large national contractor  two contract principals that have completed asset sales and other reorganization efforts have been accepted into the excess of loss treaty 
the company received claims related to the third contract principal in  making it ineligible for inclusion in the excess of loss treaty 
the company believes it is adequately reserved for any exposure related to this principal and is not currently providing bonds to this contractor 
third party reinsurance compared to third party reinsurance effective january   cna surety entered into a new excess of loss treaty excess of loss treaty with a group of third party reinsurers on terms similar to the excess of loss treaty 
under the excess of loss treaty  the company s net retention per principal remains at million with a co participation in the million layer of third party reinsurance coverage above the company s retention 
the material differences between the excess of loss treaty and the company s excess of loss treaty are as follows 
the annual aggregate coverage increases from million in to million in the base annual premium for the excess of loss treaty is million compared to the actual cost of the excess of loss treaty of million net of expected return premium 
the contract again includes an optional twelve month extended discovery period  for an additional premium a percentage of the original premium based on any unexhausted aggregate limit by layer which will provide coverage for losses discovered in on bonds that were in force during in addition  the excess of loss treaty provides coverage for one commercial principal that had been excluded from the excess of loss treaty 
the company no longer has exposure to a second commercial principal that was excluded from the excess of loss treaty 
only the large national contractor described later that was excluded from the excess of loss treaty remains excluded from the excess of loss treaty

the quota share treaty was renewed for one year on january  on substantially the same terms except that the ceding commission to ccc and cic was reduced to in order to provide an approximate override commission to ccc and cic 
the stop loss contract terminated on december  and was not renewed 
the stop loss contract protected the insurance subsidiaries from adverse loss experience on certain business underwritten after the merger date 
the stop loss contract between the insurance subsidiaries and ccc limited the insurance subsidiaries prospective net loss ratios with respect to certain accounts and lines of insured business for three full accident years following the merger date

in consideration for the coverage provided by the stop loss contract  the insurance subsidiaries paid to ccc an annual premium of  the cna surety insurance subsidiaries have paid ccc all required annual premiums 
as of december   the company had billed million under the stop loss contract which has been paid by ccc  including million received in the excess of loss contract provided the insurance subsidiaries of cna surety with the capacity to underwrite large surety bond exposures by providing reinsurance support from ccc

the two excess of loss contracts collectively provided coverage for losses discovered on surety bonds in force as of the merger date and for losses discovered on new and renewal business written during the term of the excess of loss contracts 
both excess of loss contracts commenced following the merger date and continued until september  the discovery period for losses covered by the excess of loss contracts originally extended until september  on january   ccc agreed to extend the discovery period to september  in return for an additional premium of  effective october   the company secured replacement excess of loss protection from ccc for per principal losses that exceed million in two parts a million excess of million and b million excess of million 
this excess of loss protection is primarily necessary to support contract surety accounts with bonded backlogs or work in process in excess of million 
the company generally limits support for new large commercial surety accounts to million 
in addition to the foregoing structural changes in its high layer excess of loss reinsurance programs  the cost for these protections increased significantly as compared to the cost of the previous two excess of loss contracts

this contract expired on december  the company and ccc entered into a new million excess of million contract for the period of january  to december  the premium for this contract was million plus an additional premium of million if a loss is ceded under this contract 
effective january   the company and ccc entered into a new million excess of million contract in force through december  the premium for this contract is million plus an additional premium of million if a loss is ceded under this contract 
the reduction in premium for reflects the reduction in the company s exposures  particularly large commercial exposures 
the company and ccc are presently discussing a possible restructuring of the reinsurance arrangements described in the preceding two paragraphs under which all bonds written for the large national contractor would be reinsured by ccc under an excess of million treaty and other cna surety accounts would be covered by a separate million excess of million treaty 
effective october   the company entered into a million excess of million excess of loss contract with ccc 
the reinsurance premium for the coverage provided by the million excess of million contract was million plus  if applicable  additional premiums based on paid losses 
the contract provided for aggregate coverage of million 
this contract effectively lowered the company s net retention per principal for the remainder of to million plus a co participation in the million layer of excess reinsurance with third party reinsurers 
this contract was to expire on december   but was commuted effective january   when the company obtained replacement coverage from third party reinsurers as part of the excess of loss treaty 
as of december  and december   cna surety had an insurance receivable balance from ccc and cic of million and million  respectively 
cna surety had reinsurance payables to ccc and cic of million as of december  cna surety had no reinsurance payables to ccc and cic as of december  large national contractor the company has provided significant surety bond protection guaranteeing projects undertaken by the large national contract principal that is excluded from the company s third party insurance 
the related party reinsurance available to the company for this principal and the credit extended to the principal by affiliates of the company are described below 
reinsurance if the company should suffer any losses that are discovered prior to september  arising from bonds issued to the large national contractor with effective dates of september  and prior  the company would retain the first million of losses on bonds written  and ccc would incur of losses above million pursuant to the extended discovery provisions of the two excess of loss treaties that expired on september  any losses discovered after september  on bonds with effective dates of september  and prior would be covered up to million pursuant to the million excess of million contract with ccc described above and a twelve month contract with ccc effective january  that provides million excess of million reinsurance coverage exclusively for the large national contractor 
for bonds that the company has written after september   in addition to the coverage provided by excess of loss reinsurance treaties described above million excess of million and million excess of million the company and ccc have entered into facultative reinsurance in connection with larger bonds 
the company s exposure on bonds written from october  through october  was limited to million per bond 
for bonds written subsequent to november  through december   the company s exposure is limited to million per bond 
for bonds the company may write in  the company s exposure will be limited to of its statutory surplus 
cnaf credit facility commencing in  cnaf has provided loans through a credit facility in order to help the large national contractor meet its liquidity needs and complete projects which had been bonded by cna surety 
in december of  the credit facility was amended to increase the maximum available loans to million from million at december  the amendment also provides that cnaf may in its sole discretion further increase the amounts available for loans under the credit facility  up to an aggregate maximum of million 
as of december  and  million and million had been advanced under the credit facility 
loews  through a participation agreement with cnaf  provided funds for and owned a participation of million and million of the loans outstanding as of december  and  respectively  and has agreed to a participation of one third of any additional loans which may be made above the original million credit facility limit up to the million maximum available line 
loans under the credit facility are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of the contractor and certain of its affiliates 
in connection with the credit facility  cnaf has also guaranteed or provided collateral for letters of credit which are charged against the maximum available line and  if drawn upon  would be treated as loans under the credit facility 
as of december  and  these guarantees and collateral obligations aggregated million and million 
the contractor implemented a restructuring plan intended to reduce costs and improve cash flow  and appointed a chief restructuring officer to manage execution of the plan 
in the course of addressing various expense  operational and strategic issues  however  the contractor has decided to substantially reduce the scope of its original business and to concentrate on those segments determined to be potentially profitable 
as a consequence  operating cash flow  and in turn the capacity to service debt  has been reduced below previous levels 
restructuring plans have also been extended to accommodate these circumstances 
in light of these developments  cnaf recorded an impairment charge of million pretax million after tax for the fourth quarter of  net of the participation by loews  with respect to amounts loaned under the credit facility 
any draws under the credit facility beyond million or further changes in the large national contractor s business plan or projections may necessitate further impairment charges 
the company intends to continue to provide surety bonds on behalf of the contractor during the restructuring period  subject to the contractor s initial and ongoing compliance with the company s underwriting standards 
indemnification and subrogation rights  including rights to contract proceeds on construction projects in the event of default  exist that reduce cna surety s exposure to loss 
while the company believes that the contractor s restructuring efforts will be successful and provide sufficient cash flow for its operations  the contractor s failure to achieve its extended restructuring plan or perform its contractual obligations under the company s surety bonds could have a material adverse effect on cna surety s results of operations  cash flow and equity 
if such failures occur  the company estimates that possible losses  net of indemnification and subrogation recoveries  but before recoveries under reinsurance contracts  to be approximately million pretax 
however  the related party reinsurance treaties discussed above should limit the company s per principal loss exposure to approximately million 
after consideration of the additional premium due in the event of losses under the reinsurance treaties discussed above  the company estimates that the financial statement impact of a failure by this contractor would be approximately million after tax 
the company has had discussions with its insurance regulatory authorities regarding the level of bonds provided for this principal and will continue to keep the insurance regulators informed of its ongoing exposure to this account 
net loss ratio the loss ratios for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
the loss ratios reflect million of favorable loss reserve development for the year ended december   and million and million in net unfavorable loss reserve development for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the improvement in the loss ratio from to is primarily due to the absence of both the adverse development on prior accident years that was recorded in and other large losses related to accident year past changes in the company s business mix and reinsurance program along with increased corporate default rates were the primary drivers of the need to substantially increase reserve levels in beginning in the late s  the company began writing more bonds for large corporate clients 
shortly thereafter  corporate default rates increased dramatically 
these exposures proved to be more volatile than the company s more traditional contract and small commercial surety products  and began resulting in a higher frequency of severe losses 
as a result  the company s reinsurers significantly increased rates  reduced the amount of coverage available to the company and excluded certain accounts from the reinsurance program 
for  the company s per principal retention increased from million to million 
although the company reduced its per principal retention to million for  these higher retentions  at a time of continuing higher frequency of severe losses  further increased the volatility of results 
reported claim activity improved dramatically in management believes that this is a result of ongoing efforts to reduce its exposures to large corporate clients  continued underwriting discipline in its traditional contract and small commercial products and a reduction in corporate default rates 
management anticipates that these factors  along with a further reduction in the company s per principal retention for most accounts to million for the and reinsurance programs will reduce the volatility of the company s results 
the favorable loss development recorded in for prior accident years resulted from loss adjustment expense payments related to prior years that were lower than previously expected 
the adverse development on prior accident years that occurred in was directly related to a significant increase in large claim activity 
management concluded that this claim activity exceeded the assumptions regarding the frequency of severe losses used in determining the then existing reserves 
first  additional contract bond claims were received during the third quarter of on a contractor that had filed for bankruptcy in february  upon review and verification of these new claims  the existing case reserve was increased by million  net of applicable reinsurance 
second  a demand was made during the third quarter of against a million insurance program bond issued on behalf of a national trucking concern that was now in bankruptcy 
this demand was in contradiction of previous information provided by the obligee on the bond 
based on this new information  management reserved the full remaining limits on this bond which resulted in million of net adverse development after the application of available reinsurance 
third  claims were also received in the third quarter of on worker s compensation self insurance bonds written between and on behalf of two principals 
after verifying coverage and obtaining supporting actuarial information on the underlying workers compensation claims  the company increased the case reserves on these bonds by million  net of applicable reinsurance 
fourth  after receiving a demand on another insurance program bond in the third quarter of  management identified an outstanding insurance program bond written on behalf of a contractor now in bankruptcy 
based on recent experience with this type of bond  which typically has few defenses available to the surety  and in particular with the obligee on this bond  management recorded a loss provision on this bond of million 
finally  management determined that the case reserve on a particular claim was insufficient due to the amount of legal fees that the company was incurring on the case 
based on their estimate of future legal expenses  management increased the reserve on this bond by million 
in addition to the net unfavorable loss reserve development  the higher net loss ratio in primarily relates to net reserve additions of approximately million for the accident year due to material adverse loss severity on the company s branch commercial and contract business 
the net additions to reserves for the accident year resulted from three large contract bond claims totaling million incurred in  an approximately million net loss on an insurance program bond for a now bankrupt large commercial account  and changes in estimates of large losses resulting from this significant adverse claim activity 
the net adverse loss reserve development in includes million associated with the assumed international credit and surety business from cna re that the company ceased writing in the remainder is primarily related to increased claim frequency in the company s small and specialty contract business 
in addition to the net unfavorable loss reserve development  the loss ratio for the accident year was adversely impacted by the occurrence of a million loss resulting from the bankruptcy of a national trucking concern 
due to the occurrence of this loss  other adverse loss trends and the uncertain outlook for the economy and credit markets at that time  the company increased the accident year loss ratio assumption on contract and large commercial business 
on january   cna surety settled litigation brought by jp morgan chase co 
chase in connection with three surety bonds issued on behalf of enron corporation subsidiaries 
the penal sums of the three bonds totaled approximately million 
the company paid chase approximately million and assigned its recovery rights in the enron bankruptcy to chase in exchange for a full release of its obligations under the bonds 
the company has no other exposure related to the enron corporation 
cna surety s net loss related to the settlement  after anticipated recoveries under excess of loss reinsurance treaties  was previously fully reserved 
immediately upon execution of the settlement documents  the company sent written notice for reimbursement to its reinsurers 
as of december   the company has billed a total of million to its reinsurers 
seven reinsurers responsible for payment of of the treaty proceeds either have paid their portions of the claim or have reached agreement with the company and paid the company to commute the entire reinsurance treaty under which the enron claim was made 
pursuant to the treaty  the company demanded and began arbitration proceedings against the two other reinsurers who have not paid their portions of the claim or commuted their treaties 
management believes that these reinsurers do not have valid defenses under the reinsurance treaties to avoid payment  and that the company will fully recover all reinsurance recoverables recorded related to this settlement 
as such  the company has not recorded a reduction with respect to the remaining reinsurance recoverables of million as of december  the surety business assumed from ccc and cic is subject to an aggregate stop loss reinsurance contract between ccc and the company that limits the company s accident year net loss ratio on this business to for accident years october  to december    and the company recorded estimated reinsurance recoveries from ccc of in  million in  million in and million in under this contract 
no reinsurance recoveries from ccc were recorded in as of december   there was no unpaid balance related to amounts due under the stop loss contract 
exposure management as the foregoing results indicate  the company s business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties associated with the current economic environment and corporate credit conditions 
in response to these risks and uncertainties  the company has enacted various exposure management initiatives  particularly to reduce its risks on large commercial accounts 
as the following table depicts  the company has reduced its exposure  before the effects of reinsurance  by in on large commercial accounts  which are defined as accounts with exposures in excess of million number of accounts as of total exposure december  as of december  commercial account exposure reduction dollars in billions million and larger to million to million to million total with respect to contract surety  the company s portfolio is predominantly comprised of contractors with bonded backlog of less than million 
bonded backlog is a measure of the company s exposure in the event of default before indemnification  salvage and subrogation recoveries 
the company does have a number of accounts with higher bonded backlogs 
for example  the company has accounts each with a bonded backlog in excess of million and accounts each with a bonded backlog of between million and million 
the company will manage its exposure to any one contract credit and aggressively looks for co surety  shared accounts and other means to support or reduce larger exposures 
reinsurance  indemnification and subrogation rights  including rights to contract proceeds on construction projects in the event of default  exist that substantially reduce cna surety s exposure to loss 
expense ratio the expense ratio increased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the increase in the expense ratio for the year ended december  primarily reflects the impact of higher reinsurance costs on net earned premiums and higher operating expenses 
ceded earned premium increased by million in  primarily due to the company s decision to reduce its per principal retention from million in to million in the higher ceded earned premium increased the expense ratio by percentage points 
operating expenses increased for the year ended december  primarily due to a increase in gross earned premium 
operating expenses were impacted by a million increase to the accrual for policyholder dividends 
this increase added approximately percentage points to the expense ratio 
the company streamlined its field office structure during in order to add consistency to operations and to reduce expenses 
no significant expense impact occurred in due to severance costs associated with this effort 
the expense ratio increased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the increase in the expense ratio for the year ended december  primarily reflects the impact of higher reinsurance costs on net earned premiums and higher operating expenses 
ceded earned premium increased by million in  due to the company s decision to reduce its per principal retention from million in to million in and costs associated with the purchase of an extended discovery period on a treaty 
the higher ceded earned premium increased the expense ratio by percentage points 
operating expenses increased for the year ended december  primarily due to a increase in gross earned premium 
operating expenses were impacted by a million accrual for post employment benefits for three former senior executives that increased the expense ratio by percentage points 
investment income for  net investment income was million compared to net investment income for and of million and million  respectively 
the annualized pretax yield was  and for  and  respectively 
the annualized after tax yield was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in investment income for is attributable to higher overall invested assets resulting primarily from significant cash flow from operations 
the decrease in investment income for is attributable to the impact of lower investment yields in part due to increased investment in tax exempt securities 
net realized investment gains losses were million and million in gains for and  respectively  and million in losses for the net gains realized in and resulted from opportunities to sell securities that the company believed would maximize the total return on its portfolio 
the net realized investment losses in reflect the company s insurance subsidiaries decision to liquidate their common equity portfolios during the volatility of the equity markets was adversely impacting the company s reported regulatory capital 
the following summarizes net realized investment gains losses for the years ended december    and years ended december  gross realized investment gains    gross realized investment losses  net realized investment gain losses    the company s investment portfolio generally is managed to maximize after tax investment return  while minimizing credit risk with investments concentrated in high quality fixed income securities 
cna surety s portfolio is managed to provide diversification by limiting exposures to any one industry  issue or issuer  and to provide liquidity by investing in the public securities markets 
the portfolio is structured to support cna surety s insurance underwriting operations and to consider the expected duration of liabilities and short term cash needs 
in achieving these goals  assets may be sold to take advantage of market conditions or other investment opportunities or regulatory  credit and tax considerations 
these activities will produce realized gains and losses 
invested assets are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate  market and credit 
due to the level of risk associated with certain of these invested assets and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of these assets  it is possible that changes in risks in the near term may significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income 
the company s quantitative and qualitative discussion about market risk is contained in item a of this form k 
interest expense interest expense increased million  or  for compared to  primarily due to higher outstanding debt levels and the higher interest rate associated with long term debt issued in the weighted average interest rate for was compared to and for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense decreased million  or  for compared to the same period in  due primarily to lower outstanding debt levels 
average debt outstanding was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
income taxes the company s income tax expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to an income tax benefit of million for and income tax expense of million for the effective income tax rates were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate is impacted by the company s significant investments in tax exempt securities 
the change in the effective tax rate in primarily relates to taxable losses from insurance underwriting and greater investments in tax exempt securities as compared liquidity and capital resources it is anticipated that the liquidity requirements of cna surety will be met primarily by funds generated from operations 
the principal sources of operating cash flows are premiums  investment income  recoveries under reinsurance contracts and sales and maturities of investments 
cna surety also may generate funds from additional borrowings under the credit facility described below 
the primary cash flow uses are payments for claims  operating expenses  federal income taxes  debt service  as well as dividends to cna surety stockholders 
in general  surety operations generate premium collections from customers in advance of cash outlays for claims 
premiums are invested until such time as funds are required to pay claims and claims adjusting expenses 
the company believes that total invested assets  including cash and short term investments  are sufficient in the aggregate and have suitably scheduled maturities to satisfy all policy claims and other operating liabilities  including dividend and income tax sharing payments of its insurance subsidiaries 
if cash requirements unexpectedly exceed cash inflows  the company may raise additional cash by liquidating fixed income securities ahead of their scheduled maturity 
depending on the interest rate environment at that time  the company could generate realized gains or losses that would increase or decrease net income for the period 
the extent of these gains or losses would depend on a number of factors such as the prevailing interest rates and credit spreads  the duration of the assets sold  and the marketability of the assets 
the need to liquidate fixed income securities would be expected to cause a reduction in future investment income 
the company might also access available or new credit facilities to meet cash needs 
this would increase interest expense by increasing the amount of debt outstanding and potentially increasing the interest rate on previously outstanding debt 
the company currently has million of borrowing capacity on existing facilities

the payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiaries is subject to varying degrees of supervision by the insurance regulatory authorities in south dakota and texas 
in south dakota  where western surety and surety bonding are domiciled  insurance companies may only pay dividends from earned surplus excluding surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets 
in texas  where usa is domiciled  an insurance company may only declare or pay dividends to stockholders from the insurer s earned surplus 
the insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends without obtaining prior regulatory approval only if such dividend or distribution together with dividends or distributions made within the preceding month period is less than  as of the end of the immediately preceding year  the greater of i of the insurer s surplus to policyholders or ii statutory net income 
in south dakota  net income includes net realized capital gains in an amount not to exceed of net unrealized capital gains 
all dividends must be reported to the appropriate insurance department prior to payment 
the dividends that may be paid without prior regulatory approval are determined by formulas established by the applicable insurance regulations  as described above 
the formulas that determine dividend capacity in the current year are dependent on  among other items  the prior year s ending statutory surplus and statutory net income 
dividend capacity for is based on statutory surplus and income at and for the year ended december  without prior regulatory approval in  cna surety s insurance subsidiaries may pay to cna surety dividends of million in the aggregate 
cna surety received no dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in cna surety received dividends of million from its insurance subsidiaries in combined statutory surplus totaled million at december   resulting in a net written premium to statutory surplus ratio of to insurance regulations restrict western surety s maximum net retention on a single surety bond to percent of statutory surplus 
under the excess of loss treaty  the company s net retention on new bonds would generally be million plus a co participation in the million layer of excess reinsurance above the company s retention and this regulation would require minimum statutory surplus of million at western surety 
this surplus requirement may limit the amount of future dividends western surety could otherwise pay to cna surety 
in accordance with the provisions of inter company tax sharing agreements between cna surety and its subsidiaries  the tax of each subsidiary shall be determined based upon each subsidiary s separate return liability

the company follows a consistent and systematic process for impairing securities that sustain other than temporary declines in value 
the company has established a watch list that is reviewed by the chief financial officer and one other executive officer on at least a quarterly basis 
the watch list includes individual securities that fall below certain thresholds or that exhibit evidence of impairment indicators including  but not limited to  a significant adverse change in the financial condition and near term prospects of the investment or a significant adverse change in legal factors  the business climate or credit ratings 
when a security is placed on the watch list  it is monitored for further market value changes and additional news related to the issuer s financial condition 
the focus is on objective evidence that may influence the evaluation of impairment factors 
the decision to record an impairment loss incorporates both quantitative criteria and qualitative information 
the company considers a number of factors including  but not limited to a the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than book value  b the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  c the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value  d whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments and e general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors 
for securities for which an impairment loss has been recorded  the security is written down to fair value and the resulting losses are recognized in net realized gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
for the years ended december    and  the company had no other than temporary declines in the value of its investment securities 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses the company retains an independent actuarial firm of national standing to perform periodic actuarial analysis of the company s loss reserves 
this analysis is based on a variety of techniques that involve detailed statistical analysis of past claim reporting  settlement activity  and salvage and subrogation activity  as well as claim frequency and severity data when sufficient information exists to lend statistical credibility to the analysis 
the analysis may be based upon internal loss experience or industry experience 
techniques may vary depending on the type of claim being estimated 
while techniques may vary  each employs significant judgments and assumptions 
the independent actuarial firm provides annually actuarial certification as to the reasonableness of actuarial assumptions used and the sufficiency of year end reserves for each of its principal insurance subsidiaries 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses includes  on an undiscounted basis  estimates of a the ultimate settlement value of reported claims  b incurred but not reported ibnr claims  c future expenses to be incurred in the settlement of claims and d claim recoveries  exclusive of reinsurance recoveries which are reported as an asset 
these estimates are determined based on the company s and surety industry loss experience as well as consideration of current trends and conditions 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is an estimate and there is the potential that actual future loss payments will differ significantly from initial estimates 
the methods of determining such estimates and the resulting estimated liability are regularly reviewed and updated 
the independent actuarial firm s analysis is the primary tool that management utilizes in determining its best estimate of loss reserves 
however  the carried reserve may differ from the independent actuarial firm s point estimate as a result of management s consideration of the impact of factors such as the following  especially as they relate to the current accident year current claim activity  including the frequency and severity of current claims changes in underwriting standards and business mix such as the company s efforts to reduce exposures to large commercial bonds changes in the claims handling process current economic conditions  especially corporate default rates and the condition of the construction economy management believes that the impact of the factors listed above  and others  may not be fully quantifiable through actuarial analysis 
accordingly  management may apply its judgment of the impact of these factors  and others  to its selection of the recorded loss reserves 
due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing the liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  the actual ultimate claims amounts will differ from the currently recorded amounts 
this difference could have a material effect on reported earnings and financial condition 
future effects from changes in these estimates will be recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period such changes are determined to be needed 
the company recorded net loss reserve development which resulted in a decrease in the estimated liability of million in the year ended december  and increases of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

this table highlights the impact of revisions to the estimated liability established in prior years 
risk based capital rbc and other regulatory ratios the national association of insurance commissioners naic has promulgated rbc requirements for property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc information is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning mechanism to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that supplement the current system of fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio the ratio of the enterprise s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
generally  a ratio in excess of of authorized control level rbc requires no corrective actions on behalf of a company or regulators 
as of december   each of cna surety s insurance subsidiaries had a ratio that was in compliance with minimum rbc requirements 
cna surety s insurance subsidiaries require capital to support premium writings 
in accordance with industry and regulatory guidelines  the net written premiums to surplus ratio of a property and casualty insurer generally should not exceed to on december   western surety and its insurance subsidiaries had a combined statutory surplus of million and a net written premiums to surplus ratio of to on december   cna surety had a combined statutory surplus of million and a net written premium to surplus ratio of to the company believes that each insurance company s statutory surplus is sufficient to support its current and anticipated premium levels 
the naic has also developed a rating system  the insurance regulatory information system iris  primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in overseeing the financial condition of all insurance companies operating within their respective states 
iris consists of twelve financial ratios that address various aspects of each insurer s financial condition and stability 
in and  most of the ratios for western surety  usa and surety bonding were within the usual ranges as defined by the naic  except as noted 
in  western surety s investment yield was outside the usual range due to a concentration of short term and tax exempt investments 
also  the two year reserve development to policyholders surplus was outside the usual range due to adverse claim development in the third quarter of in  western surety s investment yield was outside the usual range due to greater investment in tax exempt securities 
also  the one year reserve development to policyholders surplus was outside the usual range due to prior year adverse claim development 
in  usa s change in net writings was outside the usual range due to decreased writings of contract surety bonds 
in  usa s two year overall operating ratio was outside of the usual range  primarily due to increases in the loss and expense ratios 
surety bonding s investment yield for was outside of the usual range primarily due to generally lower investment rates along with a concentration of short term investments 
impact of pending accounting standards in march of  the emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on the guidance provided in eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf  as applicable to debt and equity securities that are within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas and equity securities that are accounted for using the cost method specified in accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
under eitf an investment is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost including adjustments for amortization  accretion  foreign exchange  and hedging 
an impairment would be considered other than temporary unless a the investor has the ability and intent to hold an investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of the fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment and b evidence indicating that the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
this new guidance for determining whether impairment is other than temporary was to be effective for reporting periods beginning after june  in september of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position eitf issue  which delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance included in eitf issue related to other than temporary impairment until additional implementation guidance is provided 
as a result of the delay  during  the company continued to apply existing accounting literature for determining when a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
the company continues to evaluate the impact of this new accounting standard on its process for determining other than temporary impairment of equity and fixed maturity securities  including the potential impacts from any revisions to the original guidance issued 
adoption of this standard as originally issued may cause the company to recognize impairment losses in the consolidated statements of operations which would not have been recognized under the current guidance or to recognize such losses in earlier periods  especially those due to increases in interest rates  and could also impact the recognition of investment income on impaired securities 
such an impact would likely increase earnings volatility in future periods 
however  since fluctuations in the fair value for available for sale securities are already recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on equity 
in december of  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  that amends sfas no 
sfas  as originally issued in may of sfas r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r supercedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

after the effective date of this standard  entities will not be permitted to use the intrinsic value method specified in apb to measure compensation expense and generally would be required to measure compensation expense using a fair value based method 
public companies are to apply this standard using either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
the modified prospective method requires a company to a record compensation expense for all awards it grants after the date it adopts the standard and b record compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
the modified retrospective method requires companies to record compensation expense to either a all prior years for which sfas was effective ie for all fiscal years beginning after december  or b only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption if the effective date of sfas r does not coincide with the beginning of the fiscal year 
sfas r is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations and or equity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk cna surety s investment portfolio is subject to economic losses due to adverse changes in the fair value of its financial instruments  or market risk 
interest rate risk represents the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial condition due to its significant level of investments in fixed income securities 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of the company s fixed income portfolio 
the fair value of these interest rate sensitive instruments may also be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative value of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument  income tax considerations and general market conditions 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk primarily through an asset liability matching strategy 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated by the relative short term nature of its insurance and other liabilities 
the targeted effective duration of the company s investment portfolio is approximately years  consistent with the expected duration of its insurance and other liabilities 
the tables below summarize the estimated effects of certain hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly across each investment category 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates selected reflect the company s expectations of the reasonably possible best or worst case scenarios over a one year period 
the hypothetical fair values are based upon the same prepayment assumptions that were utilized in computing fair values as of december  significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and therefore actual results might differ from those reflected in the following table
