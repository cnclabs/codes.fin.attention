item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a global pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring  developing and commercializing innovative products for the treatment of hematology and oncology patients 
we have established our own regulatory  development and sales and marketing organizations covering the us  europe and australia 
we have also developed a distributor network to cover the hematology and oncology markets in additional countries throughout europe  the middle east and asia 
to date  we have acquired the rights to four products 
thalidomide pharmion mg tm is being sold by us on a compassionate use or named patient basis in europe and other international markets while we pursue marketing authorization from the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products  or emea 
in may  vidaza was approved for marketing in the us and we commenced sales of the product in july we have filed for approval to market vidaza in europe and australia and these submissions are under review by the respective regulatory authorities 
in addition  we sell innohep in the us and refludan in europe and other international markets 
with our combination of regulatory  development and commercial capabilities  we intend to continue to build a balanced portfolio of approved and pipeline products targeting the hematology and oncology markets 
we had total sales of million in  million in and million in critical accounting policies revenue recognition we sell our products to wholesale distributors and directly to hospitals  clinics  and retail pharmacies 
revenue from product sales is recognized when ownership of the product is transferred to our customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
within the us and certain foreign countries revenue is recognized upon shipment freight on board shipping point since title passes and the customers have assumed the risks and rewards of ownership 
in certain other foreign countries it is common practice that ownership transfers upon receiving the product and  accordingly  in these circumstances revenue is recognized upon delivery freight on board destination when title effectively transfers 

table of contents we report revenue net of allowances for distributor chargebacks  product returns  rebates  and prompt pay discounts 
significant estimates are required in determining such allowances and are based on historical data  industry information  and information from customers 
if actual results are different from our estimates  we adjust the allowances in the period the difference becomes apparent 
certain governmental health insurance providers as well as hospitals and clinics that are members of group purchasing organizations may be entitled to price discounts and rebates on our products used by those organizations and their patients 
when we record sales  we estimate the likelihood that products sold to wholesale distributors will ultimately be subject to a rebate or price discount and book our sales net of estimated discounts 
this estimate is based on historical trends and industry data on the utilization of our products 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
we periodically review inventories and items considered outdated or obsolete are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
we estimate reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based on inventory levels on hand  future purchase commitments  product expiration dates and current and forecasted product demand 
if an estimate of future product demand suggests that inventory levels are excessive  then inventories are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
for the years ended december  and  we reduced the estimated net realizable value of obsolete and short dated inventory by million and million  respectively 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of product rights and property and equipment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate our ability to recover the carrying value of long lived assets used in our business  considering changes in the business environment or other facts and circumstances that suggest their value may be impaired 
if this evaluation indicates the carrying value will not be recoverable  based on the undiscounted expected future cash flows estimated to be generated by these assets  we reduce the carrying amount to the estimated fair value 
the process of calculating the expected future cash flows involves estimating future events and trends such as sales  cost of sales  operating expenses and income taxes 
the actual results of any of these factors could be materially different than what we estimate 
the net value of our product rights and property and equipment was million and million at december  and  respectively 
goodwill we completed a business acquisition in that resulted in the creation of goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill 
sfas no 
requires us to perform an impairment review of goodwill at least annually 
if it is determined that the value of goodwill is impaired  we will record the impairment charge in the statement of operations in the period it is discovered 
the process of reviewing for impairment of goodwill is similar to that of long lived assets in that expected future cash flows are calculated using estimated future events and trends such as sales  cost of sales  operating expenses and income taxes 
the actual results of any of these factors could be materially different than what we estimate 
the net value of our goodwill was million and million at december  and  respectively 
recently issued accounting standards accounting for stock based compensation on december   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends 
table of contents sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies accounting for stock based compensation  of notes to consolidated financial statements for our presentation of net income and earnings per share assuming we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of the earlier version of sfas no 
to our stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than july  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
r on july  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all rewards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we are still evaluating which method we will adopt on july  results of operations comparison of years ended december   and net sales 
net sales for the years ended december   and were as follows 
in thousands net sales us net sales europe and other countries total net sales increase from prior year   n a change from prior year n a the increase in sales for the year ended december  as compared to is due primarily to the launch of vidaza in the us on july  as well as growth in compassionate use and named patient sales of thalidomide in europe and other international markets 
vidaza sales for totaled million 
thalidomide sales totaled million in  compared to million in we began selling thalidomide on a compassionate use or named patient basis in france and belgium in april following our acquisition of gophar sas  the parent company of laphal 
in july  we began selling thalidomide in additional countries in europe and other international markets 
the growth in thalidomide sales experienced in is due both to increased volume of product sold as well as an increase in the average selling price of thalidomide in certain markets 
the increase in net sales for the year ended december  as compared to is largely due to the initiation of thalidomide sales 
in addition  sales of innohep and refludan in increased by million as those products were sold only for a partial year in net sales in were generated by innohep and refludan  both of which we began selling in the second half of the year 
the combined sales of these products and other orphan products acquired as part of our acquisition of laphal totaled million in and million in 
table of contents cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of product sold  royalties due on the sales of our products and the distribution and logistics costs related to selling our products 
cost of sales for the years ended december   and were as follows 
in thousands cost of sales increase from prior year   n a change from prior year n a as a of net sales the increase in cost of sales in and over the predecessor year is attributable to the increase in sales for those years 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales experienced in as compared to is largely due to charges totaling million recorded in relating to refludan product inventory 
these charges increased cost of sales as a percentage of net sales by approximately percentage points 
the launch of vidaza in also improved the overall gross margin as compared to  reducing cost of sales as a percentage of net sales by approximately percentage points as the vidaza gross margin is higher than that of our other products on a combined basis 
clinical  development and regulatory expenses 
clinical  development and regulatory expenses generally consist of regulatory  clinical and manufacturing development  and medical and safety monitoring costs for both products in development as well as products being sold 
clinical  development and regulatory expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows 
in thousands clinical  development and regulatory expenses increase from prior year   n a change from prior year n a clinical  development and regulatory expenses for the year ended december  increased by million over this increase was due primarily to a million increase in medical safety and monitoring costs associated with the selling of our products  including expanded staffing to support the growth in sales of thalidomide as well as the us launch of vidaza 
clinical and regulatory expenses increased by million in as compared to this increase was primarily related to a million increase in personnel related costs as we expanded staffing to support the regulatory and clinical development activities of thalidomide and vidaza  including the pursuit of european marketing authorization approvals for those products 
in addition we incurred a net cost of million in for the settlement of a patent infringement suit filed by us against lipomed  ag 
these increases in clinical and regulatory expenses were partially offset by million decline in clinical development expenses for vidaza and thalidomide in  due primarily to the completion of clinical data analysis in to support the submission of the vidaza new drug approval application filed with the fda in the fourth quarter of finally  manufacturing development expenses declined by million in due to the completion in of vidaza manufacturing development activities required for the submission of the new drug application for vidaza 
clinical  development and regulatory expenses increased by million during the year ended december  as compared to in we spent approximately million on vidaza and thalidomide development  primarily for clinical programs  analysis of data from previously completed phase iii studies  manufacturing and formulation development  pursuing regulatory authorizations to sell thalidomide in europe on a compassionate use and named patient basis  and establishing a medical safety  education and distribution system to support our thalidomide sales 
this represented an increase of million over product development expenses in the remainder of the million increase was due to increased salaries and benefits expenses and other non product specific costs 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  the cost to complete projects in development is not reasonably estimable 
results from clinical trials 
table of contents may not be favorable 
further  data from clinical trials is subject to varying interpretation  and may be deemed insufficient by the regulatory bodies reviewing applications for marketing approvals 
as such  clinical development and regulatory programs are subject to risks and changes that may significantly impact cost projections and timelines 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling expenses include salaries and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  advertising and promotional programs  professional education programs and facility costs for our sales offices located throughout europe  and in thailand and australia 
general and administrative expenses include personnel related costs for corporate staff  outside legal  tax and auditing services  and corporate facility and insurance costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows 
in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses increase from prior year   n a change from prior year n a selling  general and administrative expenses have increased significantly over the three years ended december  as we established our commercial organizations in the us  europe  australia and thailand to support the selling of our products in these markets 
our general and administrative functions also expanded over this period to support the growth of our business and the additional requirements of becoming a publicly held company 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million over generally  this increase is due to expansion of our commercial organization and sales and marketing activities in the us and our european and other international markets to support the us launch of vidaza and the significant growth in thalidomide sales 
field sales and sales management expenses in the us increased by million in due to the expansion of our sales organization to support the launch of vidaza 
we increased our us field based organization from approximately employees to employees during other us selling expenses also increased in connection with the vidaza launch 
european and international field sales and sales management expenses increased by million in we began selling thalidomide in europe on a compassionate use or named patient basis in mid the sales expense growth in reflects having these costs for a full year in as well as increased selling activities to support the sales growth of thalidomide 
marketing expenses increased by million in  due primarily to the us launch of vidaza and increased activities to support the sales growth of thalidomide 
product marketing costs increased by million while non product specific costs  such as personnel costs and travel  increased by million 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million for  an increase of million over in the second half of and the first half of  following the in licensing of refludan and innohep  we began establishing our sales organizations in the us  europe  and australia and expanded our marketing staffing to support the commercialization of these products 
this resulted in a million increase in personnel related expenses  including salaries  benefits and travel  for the year ended december over significant product marketing costs totaling million were incurred to launch refludan and innohep in  resulting in only a slight increase of 
million to product specific marketing costs in general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million over the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to increased costs associated with becoming a public company with the completion of our initial public offering in november professional fees  including legal  accounting  tax and sarbanes oxley implementation consulting  increased by million during directors and officers liability insurance premiums increased by 
million in and the establishment of our investor relations function increased expenses by 
million 
in addition  business development costs increased by 
million in as we significantly increased our activities associated with identifying potential product licensing and acquisition candidates 

table of contents general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million over this increase was due primarily to increased salaries  benefits and travel costs resulting from personnel hired to expand our corporate infrastructure and to support the additional responsibilities of becoming a public company 
of the million increase  million relates to facility and depreciation expenses  
million to corporate staffing to support our business growth  
million to insurance costs  partially offset by a decrease of 
million in other corporate expenses 
product rights amortization 
product rights amortization expense for the years ended december   and was as follows 
in thousands product rights amortization increase from prior year   n a change from prior year n a the increase in amortization expense in as compared to is due primarily to having a full year of amortization of product rights acquired through the purchase of laphal developement in april in addition  the august renegotiation of the financial terms of the refludan product rights resulted in an increase to the value of the capitalized product rights and increased the related amortization expense for all of compared to only months of the increase in is due primarily to the amortization of product rights acquired through the acquisition of laphal and the renegotiation of the financial terms of the refludan rights in august interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net  totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million over this increase is due primarily to increased interest income from higher balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from the equity offerings completed in november and july in addition  in march million of convertible notes  originally issued in april  were converted into shares of our common stock  thereby eliminating the interest expense associated with those notes 
interest and other income expense  net totaled 
for the year ended december   a decrease of million as compared to the year ended december  this net decrease is primarily due to higher interest expense in related to the million convertible notes issued in april income tax expense 
income tax expense totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  and 
million for the year ended december  although we have incurred pre tax losses on a consolidated basis  certain of our foreign subsidiaries generate taxable income  and therefore incur income tax expense 
the increase in income tax expense for as compared to is due primarily to an increase in taxable income in certain foreign countries 
the million increase in income tax expense for as compared to is due to similar factors  largely driven by the acquisition of laphal developpement in april liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have incurred significant losses and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we achieved profitability on a quarterly basis for the first time in the fourth quarter of  but have not yet achieved profitability on a full year basis 
we expect that our clinical  development and regulatory and selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to grow and  as a result  we will need to generate significant sales to maintain profitability 
to date  our operations have been funded with proceeds from the sale of preferred stock  the issuance of convertible notes  and the sale of common stock in two public offerings 
net proceeds from our preferred stock sales totaled million  the issuance of convertible notes generated million  and our public offerings of common stock completed in november and july resulted in combined net proceeds of million 
we began generating revenue from product sales in july 
table of contents cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase is primarily due to the receipt of the net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock completed in july of million plus million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and warrants  partially offset by cash used to fund operations of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  million to repay debt obligations  and net cash of million paid to celgene to reduce our thalidomide product supply cost  add three countries to our thalidomide licensed territory and to eliminate celgene s right to terminate the thalidomide license agreement in the event thalidomide has not received a marketing approval by november we expect that our cash on hand at december   along with cash generated from expected product sales  will be adequate to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we reexamine our cash requirements periodically in light of changes in our business 
for example  in the event that we make additional product acquisitions  we may need to raise additional funds 
adequate funds  either from the financial markets or other sources may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
insufficient funds may cause us to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our planned development  commercialization or expansion activities 
our future capital needs and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities  the cost of clinical studies and other actions needed to obtain regulatory approval of our products in development  and the timing and cost of any product acquisitions 
accounts receivable  net increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase is due to the growth in sales in  primarily from the launch of vidaza in the us and increased thalidomide sales in europe and other international markets 
our customer payment practices vary significantly between countries 
increased sales in countries in which payments tend to be slower  often as a result of the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers  may increase the financial risk of certain of our customers in those countries 
accounts receivable in countries in which customer payments are typically slow  namely spain and portugal  totaled million at december  to date  we have experienced minimal losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and we believe that the accounts receivable for spain and portugal are collectible 
we continually seek improvement in our collection process to maximize cash flow from product sales in a timely manner 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  were as follows less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in millions operating leases clinical development funding product and company acquisition payments product royalty payments inventory purchase commitments long term debt obligations total fixed contractual obligations operating leases 
our commitment for operating leases relates primarily to our corporate and sales offices located in the us  europe  thailand and australia 
these lease commitments expire on various dates through clinical development funding 
we have entered into two agreements with celgene to provide funding to support clinical development studies sponsored by celgene studying thalidomide as a treatment for various types of cancers 
under these agreements  we will pay celgene million in and million in each of and product and company acquisition payments 
we have future payment obligations associated with our acquisition of laphal and our licensing of refludan 
certain of these payments are fixed and determinable 
table of contents while the timing and amount of others are contingent upon future events such as achieving revenue milestones 
under the terms of our agreements with schering  we agreed to make an aggregate of million of fixed payments to schering  payable in quarterly installments of million through the end of for our license of refludan and a royalty of of our net sales of refludan commencing in january and up to million of contingent payments described below 
in the fourth quarter of  we achieved a cumulative sales milestone related to our acquisition of laphal 
according  we paid in the first quarter of a total of million approximately million to the former shareholders of the parent company of laphal 
product royalty payments 
pursuant to our thalidomide product license agreements with celgene  we are required to make additional quarterly payments to the extent that the royalty and license payments due under those agreements do not meet certain minimums 
these minimum royalty and license payment obligations expire the earlier of or the date we obtain regulatory approval to market thalidomide in the eu the amounts reflected in the summary above represent the minimum amounts due under these agreements 
in addition  our innohep license agreement with leo pharma requires annual minimum royalty payments through inventory purchase commitments 
the contractual summary above includes contractual obligations related to our product supply contracts 
under these contracts  we provide our suppliers with rolling month supply forecasts  with the initial month periods representing binding purchase commitments 
contingent product and company acquisition payments 
the contractual summary above reflects only payment obligations for product and company acquisitions that are fixed and determinable 
we also have contractual payment obligations  the amount and timing of which are contingent upon future events 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  contingent payment obligations are not recorded on our balance sheet until the amount due can be reasonably determined 
under the agreements with schering  in addition to the million of fixed payments required  payments totaling up to million are due if milestones relating to revenue and gross margin targets for refludan are achieved 
the terms of our laphal acquisition require a second payment of million  or an aggregate of approximately million based on foreign currency exchange rates as of december   if laphal s products achieve future revenue milestones 
factors affecting our business conditions in addition to the other information included in this report  the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects 
risks related to our business we have a history of net losses  and may not maintain profitability in the future 
we have incurred annual net losses since our inception  including a net loss of million on an annual basis for the fiscal year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in february  we announced that the fourth quarter of was our first profitable quarter 
we expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize our products  including costs and expenses associated with completing clinical trials  seeking regulatory approvals and marketing of our products 
furthermore  our expenditures could increase significantly if we acquire additional products or product candidates 
accordingly  we will need to generate significantly greater revenues to maintain profitability 
if we fail to achieve profitability on a continuous basis within the time frame expected by investors or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock may decline 
our business is largely dependent on the commercial success of vidaza 
if we are unable to successfully commercialize vidaza we may be unable to continue our operations as planned 
the success of our business is largely dependent on the commercial success of vidaza 
although initial sales of vidaza since we launched the product last year are encouraging  vidaza is new to the market and we do not have substantial data on the use of the product by physicians and patients 
as a consequence  we cannot assure you that vidaza will gain widespread acceptance from members of the medical community or that the 
table of contents initial acceptance of vidaza we have observed thus far will be maintained 
acceptance will be a function of its continued acceptance by regulators  physicians  patients and other key decision makers as a safe  superior therapeutic as compared to currently existing or future treatments for mds 
moreover  the fda is currently considering for approval new therapeutics for treating mds that have been under development by our competitors 
even if vidaza does achieve market acceptance  we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if these new products are introduced and are more favorably received than vidaza or render vidaza obsolete 
regulatory authorities in our markets subject approved products and manufacturers of approved products to continual regulatory review 
previously unknown problems  such as unacceptable toxicities or side effects  may only be discovered after a product has been approved and used in an increasing number of patients 
if this occurs  regulatory authorities may impose labeling restrictions on the product that could affect its commercial viability or could require withdrawal of the product from the market 
because vidaza has only recently been approved for commercial sale  there is a risk that we will discover such previously unknown problems associated with the use of vidaza in patients  which could limit sales growth or cause sales of vidaza to decline 
we may not receive regulatory approvals for thalidomide pharmion mg or  outside of the us  for vidaza  or approvals may be delayed 
our ability to fully commercialize thalidomide pharmion mg is subject to regulatory approval by governmental authorities in europe and our other markets  and our ability to commercialize vidaza outside the us is subject to regulatory approval by governmental authorities in europe and elsewhere 
in may  we withdrew our multiple myeloma applications with the emea for thalidomide pharmion mg  based on the emea s stated view that additional clinical data would be required before it can reach an opinion on whether or not thalidomide pharmion mg should be approved as a treatment for multiple myeloma 
we intend to resubmit our application with additional clinical data from ongoing studies in both relapsed refractory and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients 
in september the emea accepted for review our marketing authorization application for vidaza for the treatment of mds based on data from the same clinical studies accepted by the fda for approval of vidaza in the us we cannot assure you that the results of our ongoing clinical trials for thalidomide pharmion mg and the data submitted to the emea for approval of vidaza will support our applications for these regulatory approvals 
the timing of our submissions  the outcome of reviews by the applicable regulatory authorities in each relevant market  and the initiation and completion of clinical trials are subject to uncertainty  change and unforeseen delays 
moreover  favorable results in later stage clinical trials do not ensure regulatory approval to commercialize a product 
some companies that have believed their products performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain regulatory approval of their products 
we will not be able to market thalidomide pharmion mg or vidaza in any country where the drug is not approved  and if thalidomide pharmion mg or vidaza is not approved for sale in a market where we have acquired rights to the product  we will only be able to sell it in such market  if at all  on a compassionate use or named patient basis  which may limit sales and revenues 
thalidomide s history of causing birth defects may prevent it from becoming commercially successful 
at the time thalidomide first came on the market in the late s and into the early s  it was not known that the drug could cause birth defects in babies born to women who had taken the drug while pregnant 
although no proper census was ever taken  it has been estimated that there were between  and  babies born with birth defects as a result of thalidomide 
the majority of these births were in the uk and germany  two of our largest target markets for sales of thalidomide pharmion mg 
as a result  thalidomide s historical reputation in our target markets may delay or prevent regulatory approval in europe or may present a substantial barrier to its market acceptance 
thalidomide s potential for causing severe birth defects and its negative historical reputation may limit the extent of its market acceptance among both doctors and patients  despite the efficacy that it has been proven to have in patients afflicted with a number of different diseases 
in addition  any report of a birth defect attributed to the current use of thalidomide could result in a material decrease in our sales of thalidomide  and may result in the forced withdrawal of thalidomide from the market 

table of contents if the third party manufacturers upon whom we rely fail to produce our products in the volumes that we require on a timely basis  or to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers  we may face delays in the commercialization of  or be unable to meet demand for  our products and may lose potential revenues 
we do not manufacture any of our products and we do not plan to develop any capacity to do so 
we have contracted with third party manufacturers to manufacture each of our four products 
the manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment  including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls 
manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production  especially in scaling up initial production 
these problems include difficulties with production costs and yields  quality control and assurance and shortages of qualified personnel  as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal  state and foreign regulations 
our third party manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may terminate their agreements with us 
regulatory authorities in our markets require that drugs be manufactured  packaged and labeled in conformity with cgmp regulations and guidelines 
in addition  before any product batch produced by our manufacturers can be shipped  it must conform to release specifications pre approved by regulators for the content of the pharmaceutical product 
the manufacturing process for vidaza is very complex  and we have limited experience with manufacturing commercial batches of vidaza 
there is a risk that our manufacturers will not comply with all applicable regulatory standards  and may not be able to manufacture vidaza on a commercial scale that conforms on a consistent basis to our release specifications approved by the fda 
to date  we have relied on sole sources for the manufacture of our products and we do not have alternate manufacturing plans in place at this time 
the number of third party manufacturers with the expertise  required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture bulk drug substance on a commercial scale is extremely limited  and it would take a significant amount of time to arrange for alternative manufacturers 
if we need to change to other commercial manufacturers  the fda and comparable foreign regulators must approve these manufacturers facilities and processes prior to our use  which would require new testing and compliance inspections  and the new manufacturers would have to be educated in or independently develop the processes necessary for the production of our products 
any of these factors could cause us to delay or suspend clinical trials  regulatory submissions  required approvals or commercialization of our products or product candidates  entail higher costs and result in our being unable to effectively commercialize our products 
furthermore  if our third party manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of bulk drug substance or finished product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices  and we are unable to promptly find one or more replacement manufacturers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost  in substantially equivalent volume and on a timely basis  we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and we would lose potential revenues 
moreover  failure of our third party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of product candidates or products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of vidaza and our other products 
fluctuations in our operating results could affect the price of our common stock 
our operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to many factors  including the amount and timing of sales of our products  the availability and timely delivery of a sufficient supply of our products  the timing and expenses of clinical trials  announcements regarding clinical trial results and product introductions by us or our competitors  the availability and timing of third party reimbursement and the timing of regulatory submissions and approvals 
if our operating results do not match the expectations of securities analysts and investors as a result of these and other factors  the trading price of our common stock will likely decrease 

table of contents if we breach any of the agreements under which we license commercialization rights to products or technology from others  we could lose license rights that are important to our business 
we license commercialization rights to products and technology that are important to our business  and we expect to enter into similar licenses in the future 
for instance  we acquired our first four products through exclusive licensing arrangements 
under these licenses we are subject to commercialization and development  sublicensing  royalty  insurance and other obligations 
if we fail to comply with any of these requirements  or otherwise breach these license agreements  the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in whole or to terminate the exclusive nature of the license 
loss of any of these licenses or the exclusivity rights provided therein could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our failure to successfully acquire  develop and market additional product candidates or approved products would impair our ability to grow 
as part of our growth strategy  we intend to acquire  develop and market additional products and product candidates 
because we neither have  nor currently intend to establish  internal research capabilities  we are dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other researchers to sell or license products to us 
the success of this strategy depends upon our ability to identify  select and acquire the right pharmaceutical product candidates and products 
to date  we have in licensed rights to four products  and our only product acquisitions have been those associated with our acquisition of laphal 
any product candidate we license or acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale  including extensive clinical testing and approval by the fda and applicable foreign regulatory authorities 
all product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any products that we develop or acquire that are approved will be manufactured or produced economically  successfully commercialized or widely accepted in the marketplace 
proposing  negotiating and implementing an economically viable acquisition is a lengthy and complex process 
other companies  including those with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  may compete with us for the acquisition of product candidates and approved products 
we may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates and approved products on terms that we find acceptable  or at all 
we face substantial competition  which may result in others commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do 
our industry is highly competitive 
our success will depend on our ability to acquire  develop and commercialize products and our ability to establish and maintain markets for our products 
potential competitors in north america  europe and elsewhere include major pharmaceutical companies  specialized pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms  universities and other research institutions 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience  and greater manufacturing  marketing and financial resources  than we do 
accordingly  our competitors may develop or license products or other novel technologies that are more effective  safer or less costly than our existing products or products that are being developed by us  or may obtain regulatory approval for products before we do 
clinical development by others may render our products or product candidates noncompetitive 
other pharmaceutical companies may develop generic versions of our products that are not subject to patent protection or otherwise subject to orphan drug exclusivity or other proprietary rights 
governmental and other pressures to reduce pharmaceutical costs may result in physicians writing prescriptions for these generic products 
increased competition from the sale of competing generic pharmaceutical products could cause a material decrease in revenue from our products 

table of contents the primary competition and potential competition for our products currently are thalidomide pharmion mg velcade tm  from millennium pharmaceuticals inc  and revlimid tm  from celgene corporation  vidaza thalomid and revlimid tm  each from celgene  and dacogen tm  from supergen inc  with marketing rights held by mgi pharma  inc  which like vidaza  is a demethylating agent  innohep lovenox  from sanofi aventis  fragmin  from pfizer  inc and arixtra  from glaxosmithkline plc  and refludan argatroban  from glaxosmithkline 
both dacogen and revlimid are currently in development and or under review for regulatory approval by the fda and emea 
in addition to these products  there are additional products in clinical development for the treatment of mds and the enrollment of patients in clinical trials for these products may reduce the number of patients that will receive vidaza treatment 
we also face competition for vidaza from traditional therapies for the treatment of mds  including the use of blood transfusions and growth factors 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage for thalidomide pharmion mg 
historically  the vast majority of product liability insurers have been unwilling to write any product liability coverage for thalidomide 
although we currently have product liability coverage for thalidomide pharmion mg that we believe is appropriate  if our sales of this product grow in the future  our current coverage may be insufficient 
we may be unable to obtain additional coverage on commercially reasonable terms if required  or our coverage may be inadequate to protect us in the event claims are asserted against us 
in addition  we might be unable to renew our existing level of coverage if there were a report of a birth defect attributable to the current use of thalidomide  whether or not sold by us 
our failure to raise additional funds in the future may affect the development and sale of our products 
our operations to date have generated substantial and increasing needs for cash 
the development and approval of our product candidates and the acquisition and development of additional products or product candidates by us  as well as the expansion of our sales  marketing and regulatory organizations  will require a commitment of substantial funds 
our future capital requirements are dependent upon many factors and may be significantly greater than we expect 
we believe  based on our current operating plan  including anticipated sales of our products  that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements due to slower than anticipated sales of our products or otherwise  or if we acquire additional products or product candidates  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our planned development  commercialization or expansion activities  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 
our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years 
we are highly dependent on our senior management  especially patrick j 
mahaffy  our president and chief executive officer  and judith a 
hemberger  our executive vice president and chief operating officer  whose services are critical to the successful implementation of our product acquisition  development and regulatory strategies 
each of mr 
mahaffy and dr 
hemberger has entered into an employment agreement with us for a term that runs until the agreement is otherwise terminated by us or them 
their employment agreements provide that they cannot compete with us for a period of one year after their employment with us is terminated 
if we lose 
table of contents their services or the services of one or more of the other members of our senior management or other key employees  our ability to successfully implement our business strategy could be seriously harmed 
we are not aware of any present intention of any of these individuals to leave our company 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of the members of our senior management 
replacing key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop  gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products successfully 
competition to hire from this limited pool is intense  and we may be unable to hire  train  retain or motivate these additional key personnel 
we have limited patent protection for our current products  and we may not be able to obtain  maintain and protect proprietary rights necessary for the development and commercialization of our products or product candidates 
our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining a strong proprietary position for our products both in the us  europe and elsewhere 
of our four current products  thalidomide pharmion mg and refludan currently have patent protection under issued patents 
as a result  we must rely in large part on orphan drug exclusivity  trade secrets  know how and continuing technological innovations to protect our intellectual property and to enhance our competitive position 
even if we are granted orphan drug exclusivity  competitors are not prohibited from developing or marketing different drugs for an indication 
as a result  competitors could overcome the competitive advantage gained by orphan drug exclusivity by introducing other products in the same indication 
until we are granted a marketing authorization  while we are selling thalidomide pharmion mg on a compassionate use and named patient basis  we do not have orphan drug exclusivity and we must rely on our use patent protection to prevent competitors from selling thalidomide in our markets 
we also rely on protection derived from trade secrets  process patents  know how and technological innovation 
to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information  we generally seek to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and collaborators upon the commencement of a relationship with us 
however  we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances 
in addition  adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information 
the loss or exposure of our trade secrets  know how and other proprietary information could harm our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
furthermore  others may have developed  or may develop in the future  substantially similar or superior know how and technology 
we intend to seek patent protection whenever it is available for any products or product candidates we acquire in the future 
however  any patent applications for future products may not issue as patents  and any patent issued on such products may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
furthermore  the claims in patents which have been issued on products we may acquire in the future may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from commercializing competing products 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries in which we compete may not protect the intellectual property on which we may rely to the same extent as do the laws of the us if we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our products  our ability to compete could be impaired 
we may undertake acquisitions in the future and any difficulties from integrating such acquisitions could damage our ability to attain or maintain profitability 
we may acquire additional businesses  products or product candidates that complement or augment our existing business 
to date  our only experience in acquiring and integrating a business involved our acquisition of laphal in march integrating any newly acquired business or product could be expensive and time consuming 
we may not be able to integrate any acquired business or product successfully or operate any acquired business profitably 
moreover  if we acquire additional businesses or products we will incur significant acquisition costs and operating expenses  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to make acquisitions  which may result in dilution for stockholders and the incurrence of indebtedness 

table of contents changes to financial accounting standards may affect our results of operations and cause us to change our business practices 
we prepare our financial statements to conform with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  in the united states 
these accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting policies 
a change in those accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced or adopted 
changes to those rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  accounting policies affecting certain aspects of our business  including rules relating to employee stock option grants  have recently been revised 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which amends sfas no 
to require the recognition of employee stock options as compensation based on their fair value at the time of grant with limited exceptions 
these new rules  which are effective on the commencement of the first interim period starting after june   will require us to change our accounting policy and record an expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method  and will result in additional accounting charges as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recently issued accounting standards 
our business is subject to economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with international sales and operations 
since we sell our products in europe  australia and many additional countries  our business is subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally 
we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue 
in addition  a number of our suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including difficulties in compliance with foreign laws and regulations  changes in foreign regulations and customs  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and currency controls  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic environment  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions by the us or foreign governments  negative consequences from changes in tax laws  difficulties associated with staffing and managing foreign operations  longer accounts receivable cycles in some countries  and differing labor regulations 
risks related to our industry our ability to generate revenue from our products will depend on reimbursement and drug pricing policies and regulations 
our ability to achieve acceptable levels of reimbursement for drug treatments by governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize  and attract collaborative partners to invest in the development of  product candidates 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of together with rulemaking by the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  changed the methodology for medicare reimbursement of pharmaceutical products administered in physician offices and hospital outpatient facilities  including 
table of contents vidaza and innohep 
under the new regulations  reimbursements will now be the average selling price  or asp  of a product plus  rather than a specified discount from the average wholesale price  or awp  as was the case under prior regulations 
the new asp based reimbursement regime generally will reduce the reimbursement physicians will receive under medicare for most office administered injectable drugs  including vidaza and innohep 
although the actual impact of these reimbursement changes is not currently well known  there is a risk that the new reimbursement policies will adversely affect product use by physicians  thereby reducing our sales for these products 
in other countries  particularly the countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and the level of reimbursement are subject to governmental control 
we cannot be sure that reimbursement in the us  europe or elsewhere will be available for any products we may develop or  if already available  will not be decreased or eliminated in the future 
if reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products  and may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on our products 
third party payers increasingly are challenging prices charged for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the us and the changes in health insurance programs  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may result in lower prices for pharmaceutical products  including any products that may be offered by us 
cost cutting measures that health care providers are instituting  and the effect of any health care reform  could harm our ability to sell any products that are successfully developed by us and approved by regulators 
moreover  we are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect this legislation or regulation would have on our business 
in the event that governmental authorities enact legislation or adopt regulations which affect third party coverage and reimbursement  demand for our products may be reduced thereby harming our sales and profitability 
if product liability lawsuits are brought against us  we may incur substantial liabilities 
the clinical testing and commercialization of pharmaceutical products involves significant exposure to product liability claims 
if losses from such claims exceed our liability insurance coverage  we may incur substantial liabilities 
whether or not we were ultimately successful in product liability litigation  such litigation could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources  and might result in adverse publicity  all of which would impair our business 
we may not be able to maintain our clinical trial insurance or product liability insurance at an acceptable cost  if at all  and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims or losses 
if we are required to pay a product liability claim  we may not have sufficient financial resources to complete development or commercialization of any of our product candidates and our business and results of operations will be harmed 
if our promotional activities fail to comply with the regulations and guidelines of the various relevant regulatory agencies  we may be subject to warnings or enforcement action that could harm our business 
physicians may prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product s labeling for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the fda or similar regulatory authorities in other countries 
these off label uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances 
regulatory authorities generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments 
regulatory authorities do  however  restrict communications on the subject of off label use 
companies cannot actively promote approved drugs for off label uses  but in some countries outside of the eu  including the eu  they may disseminate to physicians articles published in peer reviewed journals  like the new england journal of medicine and the lancet  that discuss off label uses of approved products 
to the extent allowed  we may disseminate peer reviewed articles on our products to our physician customers 
we believe our promotional activities are currently in compliance with the regulations and guidelines of the various regulatory authorities 
if  however  our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines  we may be subject to warnings from  or enforcement action by  these 
table of contents authorities 
furthermore  if the discussion of off label use in peer reviewed journals  or the dissemination of these articles  is prohibited  it may harm demand for our products 
we are subject to numerous complex regulatory requirements and failure to comply with these regulations  or the cost of compliance with these regulations  may harm our business 
the testing  development and manufacturing of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the us  europe and elsewhere 
these regulations govern or affect the testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our products and product candidates  as well as safe working conditions and the experimental use of animals 
noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements can result in refusal of the government to approve products for marketing  criminal prosecution and fines  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  prohibitions or limitations on the commercial sale of products or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts 
regulatory authorities typically have the authority to withdraw approvals that have been previously granted 
the regulatory requirements relating to the manufacturing  testing  and marketing of our products may change from time to time 
for example  at present  member states in the eu are in the process of incorporating into their domestic laws the provisions contained in the eu directive on the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials 
the directive imposes more onerous requirements in relation to certain aspects of the conduct of clinical trials than are currently in place in many member states 
this may impact our ability to conduct clinical trials and the ability of independent investigators to conduct their own research with support from us 
risks related to our common stock our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  delaware law and our employment agreements with members of our senior management contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control or management of pharmion 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws  delaware law and our employment agreements with members of senior management contain provisions which could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring shares of our common stock or replacing members of our board of directors  each of which certificate of incorporation provisions can only be amended or repealed upon the consent of of our outstanding shares 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock 
the board can determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
as a result  our board of directors could make it difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock  for example by adopting a stockholders rights plan 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the members of the board are divided into three classes 
each year the terms of approximately one third of the directors will expire 
our bylaws do not permit our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders 
under the bylaws  only our chief executive officer  chairman of the board or a majority of the board of directors are able to call special meetings 
the staggering of directors terms of office and the limitation on the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting may make it difficult for stockholders to remove or replace the board of directors should they desire to do so 
since management is appointed by the board of directors  any inability to effect a change in the board may result in the entrenchment of management 
the bylaws also require that stockholders give advance notice to our secretary of any nominations for director or other business to be brought by stockholders at any stockholders meeting 
these provisions may delay or prevent changes of control or management  either by third parties or by stockholders seeking to change control or management 
we are also subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
under these provisions  if anyone becomes an interested stockholder  we may not enter into a business combination with that person for three years without special approval  which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control 
for purposes of 
table of contents section  interested stockholder means  generally  someone owning or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years  subject to certain exceptions as described in section the employment agreements with members of our senior management provide that certain benefits will be payable to the executives in the event we undergo a change in control and the termination of the executive s employment within two years after such change in control for any reason other than for cause  disability  death  normal retirement or early retirement 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 
we completed our initial public offering in november since our initial public offering  the price of our common stock as reported by the nasdaq national market has ranged from a low of to a high of 
some specific factors that may have a significant effect on our common stock market price include actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  our announcements or our competitors announcements of clinical trial results or new products  changes in our growth rates or our competitors growth rates  the timing or results of regulatory submissions or actions with respect to our products  public concern as to the safety of our products  changes in health care  drug pricing or reimbursement policies in a country where we sell our products  our inability to raise additional capital  conditions of the pharmaceutical industry or in the financial markets or economic conditions in general  and changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock  other comparable companies or the pharmaceutical industry generally
