under the target agreement  we earn fees based on percentage of target stores net sales of mossimo branded product 
the percentage varies according to the volume of sales 
we earn on the first million of sales  on million to million of sales  and on sales above million each year 
as a result  our revenues from license royalties and design secure fees are highest at the beginning of each year and decrease throughout each year as target reaches the specific retail thresholds 
therefore  the amount of the royalty revenue received by us in any quarter is dependent not only on retail sales of branded products in such quarter  but also the cumulative level of retail sales  and the resulting attainment of royalty rate reductions in any preceding quarters in the same year 
revenues from target were and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the change in was primarily due to the contribution to revenues of modern amusement  and the sale of our mossimo branded products in canada under a licensing and design services agreement with hudson s bay company for distribution thru its zellers stores exclusively in canada 
the canadian business has diversified our customer base and expanded our territory coverage of the mossimo brand 
total revenues for were million compared to million in the increase was primarily due to revenues of million generated from modern amusement 
total revenue in increased by million  or from  and revenue from target decreased from the decrease in target revenue was primarily due to reduced consumer purchases of mossimo branded products in at target stores 
cost of sales in resulted entirely from modern amusement product sales 
cost of sales approximated of sales 
we experienced a low profit margin due to markdowns 
we expect margins to improve as regular price sales become a larger percentage of total sales 
cost of sales includes all costs and expenses incurred prior to the receipt of finished goods at the company s distribution facilities 
these costs include  but are not limited to  product cost  inbound freight charges  purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs  insurance  duty  and brokers fees 
the major components of selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses are payroll  executive bonuses  commissions payable to a third party in connection with the target agreement  and expenses incurred in connection with design related and business development activities such as travel  samples and artwork purchases  and free lance artists  as well as facilities  legal  accounting  and insurance expenses 
our s  g a increased approximately million or from to  principally due to the acquisition of modern amusement in january of and an increase in travel expense of  from primarily attributed to developing and marketing the modern amusement business 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the modern amusement segment for were million 
although overall s  g a increased in  executive bonuses decreased by million in from executive bonuses were reduced consistent with the company s comparative performance 
these bonuses which are determined at the discretion of the board of directors  in accordance with a performance criteria outlined in respective bonus plans  and are subject to a maximum annual amount based on a percent of target license royalty fees in excess of the minimum annual fee  are estimated and accrued on a quarterly basis  with a final determination made by the board of directors at the end of each year 
in the fourth quarter  management and the compensation committee concluded that the company was not going to achieve its performance targets previously established in the bonus plan  and accordingly  accrued bonuses of approximately million were reversed 
we do not expect that further increases in staff or design related activities will be necessary in order to service the target and zellers business in the future 
as further discussed in item legal proceedings of this report  we had a dispute over the commissions payable to a third party which relate to our agreement with target 
in connection with pursuing our claim  we incurred legal fees and interest of  in and  in these costs decreased by in when compared to substantially all of the costs were accrued for and expensed in years and in the company incurred an additional  in legal fees and interest 
the litigation was resolved 
provision for income taxes decreased from to by  due to a decrease in income 
the and provision for income taxes are comprised of a deferred provision of million and million and a current provision of  and million  respectively 
as of december   the company has approximately million and million of federal and state income tax net operating loss carry forwards  respectively  available to offset future taxable income  which expires in various years through year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues from target were and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the decrease in primarily due to the introduction of our mossimo branded products into canada during march of  under the agreement with hudson s bay company 
total revenues were approximately the same in and at million 
however  in we recognized million in revenues which had been deferred during the initial target contract year pending the results of an audit that was completed in second quarter of excluding the million of non recurring revenue in  total revenue in increased by million  or  and revenue from target increased from the increase in revenue from sources other than target were primarily due to the new canadian business 
the major components of selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses were payroll  executive bonuses  commissions payable to a third party in connection with the target agreement  and expenses incurred in connection with design related and business development activities such as travel  samples and artwork purchases  and free lance artists  as well as facilities  legal  accounting  and insurance expenses 
our s  g a increased approximately  or in from  principally due to increases in personnel and related payroll expenses of approximately  and increases in design related and business development activities expenses of approximately  which was partially offset by reductions in executive bonuses of  and commissions of  the increases in personnel and design related activities were necessary to better serve the target business in the united states  and to launch the new canadian business with zellers 
executive bonuses were reduced consistent with the company s comparative performance 
commissions were less in compared to because of the non recurring target revenue recognized in at the end of we completed our assessment of the benefit to be derived from our tax net operating loss carry forward and recorded a benefit for income taxes of million  which increased our diluted net income per share by 
we reduced the valuation allowance previously provided against our deferred tax assets  as a result of the extension of the target agreement through january   and the reevaluation of our forecasted operating results and resultant taxable income during the extended term of the target agreement  and the consequent expected utilization of available net operating losses during the extended term of the target agreement 
in we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately million  which decreased diluted net income per share by 
this provision is based on the applicable statutory rates for federal and california state taxes  at rate of and an effective rate of due to credit utilization  net of an additional deferred tax assets of approximately  recognized in a substantial amount of the provision for income taxes is a deferred expense and represents a reduction of the corresponding deferred tax asset to reflect the utilization of our net tax operating loss carry forwards 
diluted net income per share was in and in however  we believe that it is important to compare pretax diluted income per share of in and in  because of the significant impact that the benefit for income taxes had on the net income 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital resources as of december  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and investments  and million of short term restricted cash  as well as potential future cash flows from operations primarily resulting from the target agreement 
as of december  we had positive working capital of approximately million 
the company established a revolving line of credit with a bank in the amount of  in february the line of credit was established to open letters of credit with foreign suppliers for finished goods 
the line of credit was increased to  in june of  and subsequently increased to  in january of the line of credit is secured by two certificates of deposit totaling approximately  there is no expiration date for this line  and there are no covenants 
there is a fee charged per letter of credit opened 
open letters of credit at december  were approximately  we believe that the company s sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to meet our expected operational and capital needs for the next months and likely will be sufficient to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future and at least through january  which is the most recently extended contract term with target 
as of december  and  cash and cash equivalents were and million  respectively 
during  the company had million cash provided by operations offset by million and million of cash used in investing activities and financing activities  respectively 
the operating cash flows were primarily driven by net earnings offset by incremental cash used for the transition of modern amusement operations 
cash flows from net income plus depreciation and amortization aggregated million and was offset by cash flows used for the start up of modern amusement and the reduction in accrued liabilities 
cash flows used in investing activities resulted form the acquisition of modern amusement  the related acquisitions of leasehold improvements and equipment for the newly leased facility for the modern amusement wholesale business  which are offset by net proceeds of million from sales of short term investments 
we have a commission obligation under an agreement with a third party for of fees received from target for the duration of the target agreement through january  and for subsequent extensions if they are exercised by target 
fees incurred under this obligation were million in  million in and million in in january we completed the acquisition of the modern amusement and we amended our facility lease increasing our space from approximately  square feet to approximately  square feet  and extending the lease term thru july the expanded facility is intended to also accommodate modern amusement 
the future annual obligation under the amended lease varies each year  starts at approximately  in  increasing to  in the purchase price of the modern amusement assets of  was funded with existing cash 
the expected cash requirements in for modern amusement are approximately million  and is comprised mainly of selling  general  and administrative expenses 
most of this working capital will be satisfied through operating cash flows  and we do not expect to incur any significant capital expenditures 
the company is approached from time to time by parties seeking to sell their businesses  brands and related trademarks 
should an established viable business and marketable brand become available on favorable terms  the company may be interested in pursuing such an acquisition and may elect to fund such acquisition  in whole or in part  with available cash as well as different financing alternatives  including the issuance of debt instruments and or equity securities

c we have a commission obligation under an agreement with a third party for of fees received from target for the duration of the target agreement thru january  and for subsequent extensions if they are exercised by target 
the future commissions are based on the minimum royalty and design fee payment from target of approximately million through january critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition revenue from license royalties and design service fees are recognized in accordance with the terms of the underlying contractual agreements  which is generally after the design services are performed  and as the licensee achieves sales of the company s products 
revenue from license royalties and design service fees are generally collected on a quarterly basis  and they range from one percent to seven percent of sales  as defined in the respective agreements 
a substantial amount of the company s revenue is generated under the target agreement  under a declining rate as the year progresses and target achieves certain levels of retail sales 
accordingly  the company s revenues from target decrease as the year progresses 
the declining rate is reset each contract year on february in  target reached the minimum rate during the third quarter of the company s calendar year 
if target sales of mossimo branded products increase in the future  as a result of opening new stores or otherwise  the minimum rate of fees may apply earlier in the company s future calendar years  shifting additional revenue recognition to the first half of the year  and potentially reducing the revenue recognition in the second half of the year 
modern amusement recognizes wholesale operations revenue from the sale of merchandise when products are shipped  generally fob modern amusement s distribution facilities  and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  collection of relevant receivable is reasonably assured  pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
inventory we maintain inventories for the modern amusement segment of our business inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
the company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving current product as well as prior seasons inventory 
market value of non current inventory is estimated based on the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
to the extent that management s estimates of markdowns necessary to rapidly sell inventory differ from actual results  additional markdowns may be required that could reduce our gross margin  operating income and the carrying value of inventories 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to anticipate the changing fashion tastes of our customers and to respond to those changing tastes in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changing styles  trends or brand preferences of our customers  we may experience lower sales  excess inventories and more frequent and extensive markdowns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
deferred tax asset valuation the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
deferred taxes primarily result from the recognition of the income tax benefit to be derived from the company s net operating loss carry forward for income taxes purposes 
as of december   the company has approximately million  and million of federal and state income tax net operating loss carry forwards  respectively  available to offset future taxable income  which expires in various years through in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to more likely than not be realized in future tax returns 
the company monitors its profitability and considers the credit and collections risk of future fees under its agreements  particularly in connection with the target agreement 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required 
in addition to the company s taxable income being subject to federal  state and local income taxes  the company may be classified as a personal holding company from time to time 
personal holding company status results from more than percent of the value of outstanding stock being owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals  and more than percent of the company s income  as defined  being derived from royalties 
personal holding companies are subject to an additional federal tax at a percent tax rate on undistributed after tax earnings 
over percent of the value of the company s outstanding stock is owned by one stockholder  and in and  more than percent of the company s income  as defined  was derived from license royalties 
accordingly  the company was classified as a personal holding company in however  no personal holding company tax was due in because the company recognized certain expenses for tax purposes in that had been recognized in previous years for financial reporting purposes  and which offset the taxable income subject to personal holding company tax in in and less than percent of the company s income as defined was derived from license royalties  accordingly the company is not classified as a personal holding company and is not subject to the personal holding company tax 
the company intends to continue to take appropriate measures to avoid being classified as a personal holding company in future years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to avoid classification as a personal holding company in the future

 and records accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the amount of the liability is subject to reasonable estimation 
management makes these assessments based on the facts and circumstances available at the time  and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside counsel 
inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the united states over the last three years have had a significant effect on its operations 
since the company s future revenues are based on a percentage of sales of licensed products by licensees  the company does not anticipate that inflation will have a material impact on future operations 
exchange rates the company receives united states dollars for all its revenue from license royalties and design service fees  other than from its business in canada  which began in and does not represent a substantial amount of revenue at this time 
during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s operating results 
the company does not engage in hedging activities with respect to exchange rate risk 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no

we believe that our policies and practices limit our exposure related to the indemnification provisions of the license and design services agreements 
for several reasons  including the lack of prior indemnification claims and the lack of monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases under the license and design services agreements  we cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments  if any  related to such indemnification provisions
