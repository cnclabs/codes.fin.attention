recent events shanghai klemp metal products co  ltd in december  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with china metallurgical import export shanghai company and wanggang township economic development corporation

the joint venture manufacturers grating panels and is located in wangang township  pudong new area  shanghai in the people s republic of china 
in  the company adopted a plan to exit the grating manufacturing business through the disposition of its grating businesses  including its chinese joint venture investment 
upon adoption of the plan  the grating businesses and assets were classified and accounted for as discontinued operations  including a provision for estimated loss on disposal of the chinese joint venture of million  and we ceased consolidating the joint venture as control of its daily operations was given to our joint venture partners and our then expatriate management was removed 
in the four years since adopting this plan  the company has made several unsuccessful attempts to dispose of its investment in the joint venture and now perceives that a presence in china is consistent with its future plans for certain of its continuing operations

results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  continuing operations net sales  gross margins and ebitda percentages for and are as follows 
the percentages of ebitda to net sales exclude corporate and other ebitda 
including corporate and other ebitda  the percentages of consolidated ebitda to net sales for the years ended and are and 
net sales gross margin ebitda pressure vessels   cylinders   grating  plastics   totals   net sales for the year ended december  were up million  or  compared to the year 
sales in include million of sales from the consolidation of the company s owned chinese grating manufacturing subsidiary 
such operation had been treated as a discontinued operation 
see minority interests and return of discontinued operations to continuing operations change in plan below 
excluding such grating sales  sales were up million  or  when compared to such sales increase reflects the effects of increased backlogs in all segments of the business  which continued to grow throughout the year and produced higher fourth quarter sales in than in all segments of the business entered the year with historically low backlogs and all segments of the business recorded lower sales for the first nine months of year as compared to the comparable period in however  all segments were able to achieve higher backlogs as the year progressed and all segments recorded significantly higher sales in the fourth quarter of compared to such higher fourth quarter sales  when added to the first nine months sales  enabled each segment to achieve higher sales for the full year than in the full year such improving backlogs in all segments reflect an improving overall economic environment as well as our ability to overcome customers concerns over our financial condition 

management anticipates that it will be able to continue to increase its existing backlog in the first half of 
gross margin as a percentage of sales increased approximately in when compared to the percentage primarily due to the inclusion of the chinese grating subsidiary in excluding the sales and gross margin of the chinese grating subsidiary  the us operations gross margin percentage increased to in from in this increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to operating efficiencies from the increase in sales in combined with overall lower cost structures resulting from cost reduction efforts in  especially in the plastics segment 
the consolidation of the cylinder operations in into a single facility also had a favorable effect on the gross profit margin of that segment 
only the pressure vessel segment recorded lower gross profit margins as a percentage of sales and this was primarily attributable to production interruptions in june caused by an electrical failure which resulted in unanticipated costs and underabsorbed overheads 
management evaluates the company s segments based on ebitda  a measure of cash generation  which is presented  not as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  but because it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt and due to the close relationship it bears to reunion s financial covenants in its borrowing agreements 
excluding the chinese grating subsidiary and corporate and other ebitda  ebitda and ebitda as a percentage of sales increased in compared to primarily due not only to the same factors affecting gross profit margin discussed above  but also to significant reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses as discussed below 
a reconciliation of ebitda to operating income for and by segment and corporate and other is as follows in thousands operating profit deprec amortiz loss iation ation ebitda pressure vessels   cylinders grating   plastics   corporate and other   totals    gain on debt extinguishment  operating profit  pressure vessels   cylinders plastics  corporate and other   totals   gain on debt extinguishment  operating profit  includes income totaling million from reduction in environmental reserve

excluding this  sga decreased to million domestically  or by million 
this decrease in sga occurred in all segments  as well as the corporate office  and reflects a full year s benefit of cost cutting measures and payroll reductions implemented in as well as continuing expense reductions in excluding the sales and sga of the grating subsidiary  sga as a percentage of sales decreased to for compared to in gains on debt extinguishments as described above in this item under the captions recent events sfsc settlement  the settlement of the company s obligations to sfsc resulted in a million gain on debt extinguishment in as described above in this item under the captions recent events senior notes  million of the principal of and million of accrued and unpaid interest on certain of the company s senior notes were cancelled or extinguished in  and  of the principal of and  of accrued and unpaid interest on certain of such notes were cancelled or extinguished in other income other income for was  compared to other income of  for the components are as follows change costs to consolidate cylinder locations adjustments of environmental reserve gain on sale of property reduction of the lease termination reserve write off of assets other income  net total other income  net during may  we completed the consolidation of our cylinder manufacturing operations into a single facility in libertyville  illinois

in june  the company sublet its idle manufacturing facility in clearfield  utah and  therefore  has recorded rental income in both and the company sold idle property in the third quarter which resulted in a gain 
there were no other individually significant items of other income or expense in or minority interests minority interests of million represent income during allocated to the minority ownerships of the company s consolidated foreign grating joint venture 
minority interests are calculated based on the percentage of minority ownership 
see return of discontinued operations to continuing operations change in plan below 
interest expense interest expense for was million compared to million for this increase is primarily due to the higher level of amortization of deferred financing costs and estimated warrant value as well as the accrual of fees in connection with debt guarantees in than in income taxes there was no tax provision from continuing operations in or the company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax return reporting purposes totaling million at december  the years in which such net operating losses expire are as follows in thousands year ending december after  
the company may be able to utilize its loss carryforwards against possible increased future profitability 
however  management has determined to fully reserve for the total amount of net deferred tax assets as of december  
and to continue to do so during until management can conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all of our loss carryforwards can be utilized 
return of discontinued operations to continuing operations change in plan see above recent events  shanghai klemp metal products co  ltd  under this item year ended december  compared to year ended december  continuing operations net sales  gross margins and ebitda percentages for and are as follows 
the percentages of ebitda to net sales exclude corporate and other ebitda 
including corporate and other ebitda  the percentages of consolidated ebitda to net sales for the years ended and are and 
net sales gross margin ebitda pressure vessels   cylinders   plastics   totals   pressure vessels sales were up in compared to this increase is due to this segment s return to almost normal production and shipment levels during the first half of compared to management s decision to shut down our pressure vessels facility for the first two months of with a limited production schedule 
we made this decision in to reduce spending due to our liquidity problems and to lessen the strain on this segment s raw material vendors 
cylinder sales were flat for compared to due to weak fourth quarter shipments caused by temporary customer facility shutdowns and a resulting decrease in order levels 
this segment continues to be affected by softness in its markets 
the decrease in plastics revenues in compared to began in the second quarter of and is the result of several reasons including our reduced ability to access raw materials  which was affected by tight liquidity  and a lag in certain customers decisions on newly quoted programs  which are intended to replace finished programs  caused by uncertainty surrounding our financial condition 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the pressure vessels segment in compared to is primarily due to increased sales and to management s decision to shut down our pressure vessels facility for the first two months of as discussed above  resulting in a reduction in production activity for the second quarter causing underabsorption of overheads and a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales than would normally be expected 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales at cylinders is the result of actions to reduce costs through workforce reductions taken in the third quarter to better match production resources with volume levels 
although the same actions to reduce costs were also taken at plastics  the benefits were more than offset by the decreased volume level and the resulting effect of fixed costs on gross margin 
management evaluates the company s segments based on ebitda  a measure of cash generation  which is presented  not as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  but because it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt and due to the close relationship it bears to reunion s financial covenants in its borrowing agreements

selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sga expenses for were million  compared to million for this decrease in sga is due to including approximately million of incremental legal  audit and consultant costs related to the default on our bank financing that did not recur in the remaining decrease is related to cost cutting measures taken during  including trimming the executive payroll and reductions in administrative positions 
sga as a percentage of sales decreased to for compared to in sga as a percentage of sales was lower in compared to due to lower incremental bank induced costs and previously described cost cutting measures

critical accounting policies use of estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
application of the accounting principles requires the company s management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties and that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses which in the normal course of business are subsequently adjusted to actual results 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 
revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts sales are recorded when title and risks of ownership transfer to the buyer 
shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recorded as revenues and the related costs are recorded as cost of sales 
the company markets its products to a diverse customer base in the united states and in other countries 
credit is extended after a credit review by management  which is based on a customer s ability to perform its obligations 
such reviews are regularly updated 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon agings of customer balances and specific account reviews by management 
reunion industries has no concentration of credit risks and generally does not require collateral or other security from its customers 
accounts receivable are presented net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of  at december  and  at december   which represented and  respectively  of gross trade receivables excluding other non trade receivables 
inventories and inventory reserves at december   inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  at costs that approximate the first in  first out method of inventory valuation 
during the third quarter of  for those locations of the company that had been using the last in  first out method of inventory valuation  we changed the method of valuing inventory to the first in  first out method 
the effect on the results of operations for the year ended december  was inconsequential 
work in process and finished goods include material costs  labor costs and manufacturing overhead 
reserves for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventories are based on reviews of inventory usage reports for items more than one year old 
the company evaluates its inventories on a quarterly basis to identify excess  slow moving and obsolete inventories and assess reserve adequacy 
when this evaluation indicates such inventories exist  the reserve is increased by a charge to operations or such inventories are written off 
goodwill and impairment the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses is considered to be goodwill 
the company reviews goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we also review goodwill as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill be tested annually using a two step process 
the first is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of reporting units to their fair value 
if a potential impairment is identified  the second step is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the impairment loss 
reporting unit fair value is estimated using the income approach  which assumes that the value of a reporting unit can be computed as the present value of the assumed future returns of an enterprise discounted at a rate of return that reflects the risk of an investment 
a significant increase in the rate at which the assumed future returns are discounted could result in an unexpected impairment charge to goodwill  which could have a negative impact on our operating results 
at december   the company had million of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet 
of the million of goodwill  million relates to the pressure vessels and springs segment and million relates to the cylinders segment 
we have completed all transitional and annual impairment tests necessary to date and concluded that our goodwill is not impaired 
pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the company makes contributions to the defined benefit plans based on the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of the company uses the fair value of plan assets to determine the expected and actual returns on plan assets 
the difference between the expected return and actual return is deferred 
during the second half of and the year  the fair value of assets in both of the company s defined benefit pension plans decreased for various reasons  including a downturn in the overall economy and unusual world events 
during and  the fair value of assets increased but was mostly offset by an increase in the benefit obligation 
the company has recorded additional minimum pension liabilities in excess of amounts previously accrued totaling million at december  and million at december   which is classified as accumulated comprehensive loss within stockholders deficit at such dates 
although management believes the long term rates of return used to calculate the expected returns on plan assets are reasonable  a trend of actual returns being less than expected returns would cause future pension costs to increase 
in determining the discount rates to be used at the end of each year to determine plan liabilities  the company looks at rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
changes in discount rates over the last three years have not materially affected pension costs and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred as allowed by sfas 
the company currently expects consolidated pension costs in will approximate 
other postretirement benefits the company provides health benefits for certain retired employees at the company s pressure vessel operations and plastics and of its corporate executive payroll 
these plans are not funded 
during  management decided to sell and close its rostone operation 
as a result  there was a significant decrease in the expected benefit obligation of the plastics segment and a gain of  was recognized in and is included in discontinued operations of rostone 
the other postretirement benefit costs and the benefit obligation are actuarially determined based on discount rates and expected trends in healthcare costs 
absent the gain from rostone  costs increased slightly in over and 
the company currently expects consolidated other postretirement benefit costs for to increase slightly from 
stock based compensation the company has elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for stock options and awards 
accordingly  no compensation costs for stock options is included in operating results since all awards were made at exercise prices at or above their fair value on the dates of grants 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  amending fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure about the effects on operating results of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amends apb  interim financial reporting to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
had the company applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
there would have been no material effect on reported income loss for years  and environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired  a loss is recognized assuming the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company believes it is currently in material compliance with existing environmental protection laws and regulations and is no longer involved in any significant remediation activities or administrative or judicial proceedings arising under federal  state or local environmental protection laws and regulations 
in addition to management personnel who are responsible for monitoring environmental compliance and arranging for remedial actions that may be required  the company has also employed outside consultants from time to time to advise and assist the company s environmental compliance efforts 
as a result  the company has no significant amount of accruals for environmental costs 
factors that could affect future results reunion s vendors may restrict credit terms we have corrected many vendor related problems with liquidity generated from the refinancing and from asset sales 
however  another period of tight liquidity could result in key vendors restricting or eliminating the extension of credit terms to us 
if this would happen  our ability to obtain raw materials would be strained significantly and our ability to manufacture products would be reduced 
reunion s bank financing is subject to financial covenants we are currently not in default on our bank financing and senior notes 
however  our bank financing is subject to monthly financial and other covenants  and we have failed to meet such covenants on several occasions  for which we were able to obtain default waivers 
if our operations do not improve during  we may fail to meet one or more financial or other covenants 
if this would happen  we would be in default on our bank obligations and  subject to the terms of the loan and security agreement  all of our bank loans would be due and payable 
although it may be possible to negotiate additional waivers of defaults  no assurances can be given that we would be able to do so 
reunion operates in highly competitive mature  niche markets our products are sold in highly competitive mature  niche markets and we compete with companies of varying size  including divisions and subsidiaries of larger companies that have financial resources that exceed ours 
this combination of competitive and financial pressures could cause us to lose market share or erode prices  which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
reunion s past performance could impact future prospects because of losses suffered by the company over the past several years  potential or current customers may decide not to do business with us 
if this were to happen  our sales may not increase or may decline 
if sales do not increase  or we experience a decline in sales  our ability to cover costs would be further reduced  which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
reunion is a going concern the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
at december   the company has a deficiency in working capital of million  a loss from continuing operations of million before gain on debt extinguishment  cash used in operating activities of million and a deficiency in assets of million 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
we successfully refinanced our bank debt in december and have extinguished a significant portion of our obligations under various debt instruments over the past year 
these steps have improved liquidity and deferred the principal maturities on a significant portion of our debt 
however  on february   we announced that we were unable to make a  interest payment by february  to the holders of the senior notes 
holders of more than of the principal amount of the senior notes agreed to enter into a standstill agreement with the company 
pursuant to such standstill agreement  holders agreed that they would not exercise and will to the extent within their control cause the trustee not to exercise any remedies provided for in the indenture under which the senior notes were issued  or any other agreements related to the senior notes  with respect to this payment default or with respect to a potential event of default if the company fails to make the next scheduled interest payment due april  in the standstill agreement  such holders agreed to defer payment of the interest not paid by february   and any interest that is due april  and not paid  to december although it may be possible to negotiate additional waivers of defaults  no assurances can be given that we would be able to do so 
the company is investigating other recapitalization scenarios in an effort to provide additional liquidity and extinguishments or deferrals of debt obligations 
although we believe we can accomplish these plans  no assurances exist that we will 
failure to accomplish these plans could have an adverse impact on the company s liquidity  financial position and future operations

the fasb issued final accounting guidance in may with fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  which requires that the effect of the act to be reflected in third quarter financial statements 
the effect of such act has not had  and is not expected to have  any material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec or the staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which supersedes staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab rescinds accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the adoption of sab has not had  and is not expected to have  a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
this statement requires the allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities and clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials should be recognized as period expense 
the statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are evaluating the impact of this statement but do not expect it to have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of the american jobs creation act of introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer  provided certain criteria are met 
fas provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision  and was effective immediately upon issuance 
this accounting pronouncement had no impact on reunion as the company did not repatriate earnings in for us tax purposes 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r is a revision to sfas and supersedes apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
this statement requires a public entity to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments 
this statement also provides guidance on valuing and expensing these awards  as well as disclosure requirements of these equity arrangements 
this statement is effective for the first interim reporting period that begins after june  sfas r permits public companies to choose between the following two adoption methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
reunion currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognizes no compensation expense for employee stock options 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r on reunion cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
there would have been no material impact on reported results of operations and earnings per share had the company applied the fair value provisions of sfas to share based payments 
the adoption of sfas r s fair value method may have an impact  possibly material  on reunion s future results of operations but is not expected to significantly impact the company s overall financial position 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense  if any  to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement may reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows of periods after adoption 
due to timing of the release of sfas r and the choice between the two adoption methods  the company is still analyzing the ultimate impact that this new pronouncement may have on its results of operations 
on march   the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec or the staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
although not altering any conclusions reached in sfas r  sab provides the views of the staff regarding the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and  among other things  provide the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
reunion intends to follow the interpretative guidance on share based payment set forth in sab during the company s adoption of sfas r
