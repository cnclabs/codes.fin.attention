overview we manage investment assets and provide services for our clients through our two subsidiaries  westwood management and westwood trust 
westwood management provides investment advisory services to corporate pension funds  public retirement plans  endowments and foundations  mutual funds and clients of westwood trust 
westwood trust provides to institutions and high net worth individuals trust and custodial services and participation in common trust funds that it sponsors 
our revenues are generally derived from fees based on a percentage of assets under management  and at december  westwood management and westwood trust collectively managed assets valued at approximately billion 
we have been providing investment advisory services since and  according to recognized industry sources  including morningstar  inc  when measured over multi year periods years and longer  our principal asset classes have consistently ranked above the median in performance within their peer groups 
one of the priorities on which we have focused since our spin off in is building a foundation in terms of personnel and infrastructure to support a potentially much larger business 
we have also developed products that we believe will be desirable within our target institutional marketplace 
the cost of developing new products and the organization as a whole has resulted in us incurring expenses that do not currently have material offsetting revenue 
now that we believe the foundation and the products are in place we are taking these new products to the institutional marketplace and are hopeful that institutional investors will recognize the value in these products and generate new revenue streams for us 
revenues we derive our revenues from investment advisory fees  trust fees  and other revenues 
our advisory fees are generated by westwood management  which manages its clients accounts under investment advisory and subadvisory agreements 
advisory fees are calculated based on a percentage of assets under management  and are paid in accordance with the terms of the agreements 
most of westwood management s advisory fees are paid quarterly in advance based on the assets under management on the last day of the preceding quarter 
however  some fees are paid quarterly in arrears or are based on daily or monthly average assets under management for the stated period 
westwood management recognizes revenues as services are rendered 
our trust fees are generated by westwood trust pursuant to trust or custodial agreements 
trust fees are separately negotiated with each client and are generally based on a percentage of assets under management  which in turn is influenced by the complexity of the operations of the trust and the services provided 
westwood trust also provides trust services to a small number of clients on a fixed fee basis 
similar to advisory fees generated by westwood management  most trust fees are paid quarterly in advance and are recognized as services are rendered 
our other revenues generally consist of interest income  investment income and consulting fees 
we invest most of our cash in money market funds  although we do invest smaller amounts in bonds and equity instruments 
the most significant component of our other revenues is investment income and to a lesser extent  consulting fees paid to us by gabelli advisers  inc assets under management assets under management increased million  or  to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the increase in assets under management was primarily due to the market

matters involving our spin off from sws group  inc we were incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on december  as a subsidiary of sws 
our principal assets consist of the capital stock of westwood management and westwood trust 
on june   sws completed the spin off of westwood by effecting a dividend distribution of all of our common stock held by sws to all of its stockholders on a pro rata basis 
we are now an independent public company  with sws having no continuing ownership interest in us 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and reflect our historical financial position  results of operations and cash flows both as an independent public company and  prior to the completion of the spin off  as a part of sws 
the financial information included in this report that relates to periods up to and including the period in which our spin off from sws was completed is not necessarily indicative of what our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent public company during such periods  nor is it necessarily indicative of our future performance 
up to and including the period in which our spin off from sws was completed  our expenses were allocated by sws on the basis of our relative number of employees  relative revenues and other allocation bases 
these allocated expenses represent services provided by sws  including human resources  accounting  internal audit  income tax  legal  insurance and information technology 
in the period since the completion of the spin off  we have obtained from third parties many of the services previously provided by sws  and have found  in some cases  that the cost of these third party services is higher than those provided by sws 
we also now incur the additional expenses associated with being a publicly held company 
as a result  our pre spin off expense levels are generally lower than our post spin off expense levels 
results of operations the following table and discussion of our results of operations is based upon data derived from the consolidated statements of income contained in our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with these statements  which are included elsewhere in this report

liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations and cash requirements with cash generated from operating activities 
as of december   we had no long term debt 
the changes in net cash provided by operating activities generally reflect the changes in earnings plus the effect of non cash items and changes in working capital 
changes in working capital  especially accounts receivable and accounts payable  are generally the result of timing differences between collection of fees billed and payment of operating expenses 
during  cash flow provided by operating activities  principally our investment advisory business  was million

we had no liabilities for borrowed money at december  or december   and our accounts payable were paid in the ordinary course of business for each of the periods then ended 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors 
we believe that current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the operating and capital requirements of our ordinary business operations through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing within this time frame 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary 
the failure to raise needed capital on attractive terms  if at all  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s known contractual obligations as of december  in thousands 
payments due in contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years non cancelable operating leases recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the consensus of the emerging issues task force eitf regarding the recognition and measurement of other than temporary impairments of certain investments 
the effective date of the recognition and measurement guidance in eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  has been delayed until the implementation guidance provided by a fasb staff position on the issue has been finalized 
the disclosure guidance was unaffected by the delay and is effective for fiscal years ending after june  the company implemented the disclosure provisions of eitf in its annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  and does not anticipate that the implementation of the recognition and measurement guidance  when released  will have a material effect on the company s financial statements

sfas no 
r  requiring public companies to recognize the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions in their financial statements

these fees are determined in accordance with contracts between our subsidiaries and their clients and are generally based on a percentage of assets under management 
accounting for investments we record our investments in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we have designated our investments other than money market holdings as trading securities  which are recorded at market value with the related unrealized gains and losses reflected in other revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
our trading securities  primarily us government and government agency obligations as well as mutual fund shares  are valued based upon quoted market prices and  with respect to mutual funds  the net asset value of the shares held as reported by the fund 
we have designated our investments in money market accounts as available for sale

dividends and interest on all of our investments are accrued as earned 
goodwill effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption of sfas the company discontinued its amortization of goodwill 
the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on the comparability of the company s earnings per share or net income 
during the second quarter of  the company completed an impairment analysis of goodwill as of january   the date of adoption of sfas during the third quarters of  and  the company completed its annual impairment assessment as required by sfas no impairment loss or transition adjustments were required 
the company performs its annual impairment assessment as of july stock options effective january   we elected to begin expensing the cost associated with stock options granted subsequent to january  to employees as well as non employee directors under the sfas  accounting for stock based compensation fair value model 
we value stock options issued based upon the black scholes option pricing model and recognize this value as an expense over the periods in which the options vest 
implementation of the black scholes option pricing model requires us to make certain assumptions  including expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield and expected life of the options 
we utilized assumptions that we believed to be most appropriate at the time of the valuation 
had we used different assumptions in the pricing model the expense recognized for stock options may have been different than the expense recognized in our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we utilize various financial instruments  which entail certain inherent market risks 
we do not currently participate in any hedging activities  nor do we currently utilize any derivative financial instruments 
the following information describes the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risks 
interest rates and securities markets our cash equivalents and other investment instruments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates  which may affect our interest income 
these instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
we do not expect our interest income to be significantly affected by a sudden change in market interest rates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the value of our assets under management is affected by changes in interest rates and fluctuations in securities markets 
since we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from investment advisory and trust fees based on the value of assets under management  our revenues may be adversely affected by changing interest rates or a decline in the prices of securities generally
