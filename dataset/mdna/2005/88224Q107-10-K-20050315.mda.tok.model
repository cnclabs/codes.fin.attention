item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of our operating results our bank was formed through the acquisition of resource bank  na  which was organized in upon completion of our million private equity offering and the acquisition of resource bank  we commenced operations in december the amount of capital we raised  which we believe is the largest amount of start up capital ever raised for a national bank at that time  was intended to support a significant level of near term growth and permit us to originate and retain loans of a size and type that our targeted customers  middle market businesses and high net worth individuals  would find attractive 
our large initial capitalization has resulted in reduced levels of return on equity to date 
however  as we build our loan and investment portfolio we expect our return on equity to increase to normalized levels 

table of contents an important aspect of our growth strategy is the ability to service and effectively manage a large number of loans and deposit accounts in multiple markets in texas 
accordingly  we created an operations infrastructure sufficient to support state wide lending and banking operations 
we believe that our existing infrastructure will allow us to grow our business over the next two to three years both geographically and with respect to the size and number of loan and deposit accounts without substantial additional capital expenditures 
our historical financial results reflect the development of our company in its early stages  notably in connection with initial start up costs and the raising and retention of excess capital to fund our planned growth 
in and  we incurred significant non interest expenses for the start up and infrastructure costs described above  while revenue items gradually increased as we began to source and originate loans and other earning assets 
beginning in  we achieved improved levels of profitability as these costs have been spread over a larger asset base 
our operating results have improved significantly over the past several years as we moved into full operations

the growth in our profitability is based on several key factors we have successfully grown our asset base significantly each year  we have been able to maintain stable and diverse funding sources  resulting in increased net interest income from onward  despite a falling interest rate environment and the fact that most of our loans have floating interest rates  and the growth in our asset base has resulted in annual growth of    and in our principal earnings source  net interest income  in    and  respectively

we unwound approximately million of repurchase agreements and entered into new repurchase agreements with respect to a significant portion of that amount  with the remainder replaced with overnight funds 
a significant portion of these overnight funds were replaced with deposits when we completed our acquisition of the outstanding deposit accounts of bluebonnet savings bank fsb  which occurred on august  excluding the impact of reversing the valuation allowance  unwinding penalties and separation expense  diluted income per share would have been

table of contents summary of loan loss experience the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the reserve for loan losses at a level consistent with management s assessment of the loan portfolio in light of current economic conditions and market trends 
we recorded a provision of million for the year ended december   million for and million for the provision for losses necessary to maintain reserve adequacy decreased due to the improvement in indicators of credit quality in  such as net charge offs and non performing loans 
the reserve for loan losses is comprised of allocated reserves for impaired loans and an estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date  but not yet identified with specific loans 
we regularly evaluate our reserve for loan losses to maintain an adequate level to absorb loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
factors contributing to the determination of allocated reserves include the creditworthiness of the borrower  changes in the value of pledged collateral  and general economic conditions 
all loan commitments rated substandard or worse and greater than  are reviewed and a specific allocation is assigned based on the losses expected to be realized from those loans 
for purposes of determining the general reserve  the portfolio is segregated by product types to recognize differing risk profiles among categories  and then further segregated by credit grades 
credit grades are assigned to all loans greater than  each credit grade is assigned a risk factor  or reserve allocation percentage 
these risk factors are multiplied by the outstanding principal balance and risk weighted by product type to calculate the required reserve 
a similar process is employed to calculate that portion of the required reserve assigned to unfunded loan commitments 
the reserve allocation percentages assigned to each credit grade have been developed based on an analysis of our historical loss rates and historical loss rates within the banking industry and our markets  adjusted for certain qualitative factors 
qualitative adjustments for such things as general economic conditions  changes in credit policies and lending standards  and changes in the trend and severity of problem loans  can cause the estimation of future losses to differ from past experience 
the unallocated portion of the general reserve serves to compensate for additional areas of uncertainty and considers industry trends 
in addition  the reserve considers the results of reviews performed by independent third party reviewers as reflected in their confirmations of assigned credit grades within the portfolio 
the methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy  which is performed at least quarterly  is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and anticipated future credit losses 
the changes are reflected in the general reserve and in specific reserves as the collectibility of larger classified loans is evaluated with new information 
as our portfolio matures  historical loss ratios are being closely monitored  and our reserve adequacy will rely primarily on our loss history 
currently  the review of reserve adequacy is performed by executive management and presented to our board of directors for their review  consideration and ratification on a quarterly basis 
the reserve for loan losses  which is available to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio  totaled million at december   million at december  and million at december  this represents  and of loans held for investment at december   and  respectively

a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due both principal and interest according to the terms of the loan agreement 
reserves on impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral

our dependence on retail brokered cds is limited by our internal funding guidelines  which as of december   limited borrowing from these sources to of total deposits 
additionally  we have borrowing sources available to supplement deposits and meet our funding needs 
these borrowing sources include federal funds purchased from our downstream correspondent bank 
table of contents relationships which consist of banks that are smaller than our bank and from our upstream correspondent bank relationships which consist of banks that are larger than our bank  securities sold under repurchase agreements  treasury  tax and loan notes  and advances from the federal home loan bank  or fhlb 
as of december   our borrowings consisted of a total of million of securities sold under repurchase agreements  million of downstream federal funds purchased  million from customer repurchase agreements  and million of treasury  tax and loan notes 
credit availability from the fhlb is based on our bank s financial and operating condition and borrowing collateral we hold with the fhlb 
at december   none of our borrowings consisted of borrowings from the fhlb 
our unused fhlb borrowing capacity at december  was approximately million 
as of december   we had unused upstream federal fund lines available from commercial banks of approximately million 
during the year ended december   our average borrowings from these sources were million  or of average total fundings  which is well within our internal funding guidelines  which limit our dependence on borrowing sources to of total fundings 
the maximum amount of borrowed funds outstanding at any month end during the year ended december  was million  or of total fundings

table of contents critical accounting policies the sec recently issued guidance for the disclosure of critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the presentation of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the more significant of these policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
not all these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
however  the policies noted below could be deemed to meet the sec s definition of critical accounting policies 
management considers the policies related to the allowance for loan losses as the most critical to the financial statement presentation 
the total allowance for loan losses includes activity related to allowances calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to current earnings 
the amount maintained in the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of the loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of specific reserves assigned to certain classified loans and general reserves 
factors contributing to the determination of specific reserves include the credit worthiness of the borrower  and more specifically  changes in the expected future receipt of principal and interest payments and or in the value of pledged collateral 
a reserve is recorded when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the discounted estimated cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
for purposes of determining the general reserve  the portfolio is segregated by product types in order to recognize differing risk profiles among categories  and then further segregated by credit grades 
see summary of loan loss experience for further discussion of the risk factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for loan losses 
management considers the policies related to income taxes to be critical to the financial statement presentation 
we utilize the liability method in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the values of the assets and liabilities as reflected in the financial statements and their related tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
as changes in tax law or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
a valuation reserve is provided against deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 
in  as a result of a reassessment of our ability to generate sufficient earnings to allow the utilization of our deferred tax assets  we believed it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  in compliance with sfas no 
 we reversed the valuation allowance and certain related tax reserves during the period 
we have a gross deferred tax asset of million at december   which relates primarily to our allowance for loan losses 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
at december   we had a gross deferred tax asset of million 
in  as a result of our reassessment of our ability to generate sufficient earnings to allow the utilization of our deferred tax assets  we believed it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we reversed the valuation allowance and certain related tax reserves during the year 
new accounting standard in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement focuses 
table of contents primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this statement requires an entity to recognize the cost of employee services received in share based payment transactions and measure the cost on a grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the provisions of sfas no 
revised will be effective for the financial statements issued for periods beginning after june  we anticipate adopting the provisions of this statement july  the methodology has not yet been determined  but we anticipate that the results will not vary materially from the proforma fair value numbers that have been presented in note item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument 
these changes may be the result of various factors  including interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  or equity prices 
additionally  the financial instruments subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading purposes or held for other than trading 
we are subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on our portfolio of assets held for purposes other than trading 
the effect of other changes  such as foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and or equity prices do not pose significant market risk to us 
the responsibility for managing market risk rests with the bsmc  which operates under policy guidelines established by our board of directors 
the negative acceptable variation in net interest revenue due to a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates is generally limited by these guidelines to 
these guidelines also establish maximum levels for short term borrowings  short term assets  and public and brokered deposits 
they also establish minimum levels for unpledged assets  among other things 
compliance with these guidelines is the ongoing responsibility of the bsmc  with exceptions reported to our board of directors on a quarterly basis 

table of contents interest rate risk management the company s interest rate sensitivity is illustrated in the following table 
the table reflects rate sensitive positions as of december   and is not necessarily indicative of positions on other dates 
the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are presented in the periods in which they next reprice to market rates or mature and are aggregated to show the interest rate sensitivity gap 
the mismatch between repricings or maturities within a time period is commonly referred to as the gap for that period 
a positive gap asset sensitive  where interest rate sensitive assets exceed interest rate sensitive liabilities  generally will result in the net interest margin increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a falling rate environment 
a negative gap liability sensitive will generally have the opposite results on the net interest margin 
to reflect anticipated prepayments  certain asset and liability categories are shown in the table using estimated cash flows rather than contractual cash flows

the table above sets forth the balances as of december  for interest bearing assets  interest bearing liabilities  and the total of non interest bearing deposits and stockholders equity 
while a gap interest table is useful in analyzing interest rate sensitivity  an interest rate sensitivity simulation provides a better illustration of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
earnings are also affected by the effects of changing interest rates on the value of funding derived from demand deposits and stockholders equity 
we perform a sensitivity analysis to identify interest rate risk exposure on net interest income 
we quantify and 
table of contents measure interest rate risk exposure using a model to dynamically simulate the effect of changes in net interest income relative to changes in interest rates and account balances over the next twelve months based on three interest rate scenarios 
these are a most likely rate scenario and two shock test scenarios 
the most likely rate scenario is based on the consensus forecast of future interest rates published by independent sources 
these forecasts incorporate future spot rates and relevant spreads of instruments that are actively traded in the open market 
the federal reserve s federal funds target affects short term borrowing  the prime lending rate and the london interbank offering rate are the basis for most of our variable rate loan pricing 
the year mortgage rate is also monitored because of its effect on prepayment speeds for mortgage backed securities 
these are our primary interest rate exposures 
we are currently not using derivatives to manage our interest rate exposure 
the two shock test scenarios assume a sustained parallel basis point increase or decrease  respectively  in interest rates 
as short term rates continued to fall since we could not assume interest rate changes of basis points as the results of the decreasing rates scenario would be negative rates 
therefore  our shock test scenarios with respect to decreases in rates now assume a decrease of basis points in the current interest rate environment 
we will continue to evaluate these scenarios as interest rates change  until short term rates rise above 
our interest rate risk exposure model incorporates assumptions regarding the level of interest rate or balance changes on indeterminable maturity deposits demand deposits  interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior 
changes in prepayment behavior of mortgage backed securities  residential  and commercial mortgage loans in each rate environment are captured using industry estimates of prepayment speeds for various coupon segments of the portfolio 
the impact of planned growth and new business activities is factored into the simulation model 
this modeling indicated interest rate sensitivity as follows anticipated impact over the next twelve months as compared to most likely scenario bp increase bp decrease bp increase bp decrease december  december  december  december  in thousands change in net interest income the simulations used to manage market risk are based on numerous assumptions regarding the effect of changes in interest rates on the timing and extent of repricing characteristics  future cash flows  and customer behavior 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors
