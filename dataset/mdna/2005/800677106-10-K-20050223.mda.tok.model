actual results could differ materially from those set forth in such forward looking statements as a result of  but not limited to  the risks related to our business described in part i  item you should read the following discussion and analysis along with the selected financial data and the financial statements and notes attached to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview we were incorporated in june from our inception through december   our activities related primarily to establishing and operating a biotechnology research and development organization and developing relationships with our corporate collaborators 
our scientific and business development endeavors currently focus on the engineering of novel zinc finger dna binding proteins zfps for the regulation and modification of genes 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  borrowings  payments from federal government research grants and from corporate collaborators and strategic partners 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our revenues have consisted primarily of revenues from our corporate partners for zfp tfs  contractual payments from strategic partners for research programs and research milestones  and federal government research grant funding 
we expect revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period and there can be no assurance that new collaborations or partner fundings will continue beyond their initial terms 
in  we have placed more emphasis on higher value therapeutic product development and related strategic partnerships and less emphasis on our universal genetools collaborations 
we believe this shift in emphasis has the potential to increase the return on investment to our stockholders by allocating capital resources to higher value  therapeutic product development activities 
at the same time  it may reduce our revenues over the next several years and it increases our financial risk by increasing expenses associated with product development 
we have filed an investigational new drug ind application with the us food and drug administration fda and plan to initiate our own phase i clinical trial of a zfp therapeutic in patients with diabetic neuropathy within the first quarter of development of novel therapeutic products is costly and is subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process by the fda 
our future products are gene based therapeutics 
adverse events in both our own clinical program and other programs in gene therapy may have a negative impact on regulatory approval  the willingness of potential commercial partners to enter into agreements and the perception of the public 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  laboratory supplies  allocated facilities costs  subcontracted research expenses  and expenses for patent prosecution  trademark registration and technology licenses 
research and development costs incurred in connection with collaborator funded activities are expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
we expect these expenses will increase significantly as we focus increasingly on development of zfp therapeutics 
the company is also developing zinc finger nucleases zfns for therapeutic gene correction and therapeutic gene modification as a treatment and possible cure for certain monogenic and infectious diseases 
additionally  in order to develop 
table of contents zfp tfs as commercially relevant therapeutics  we expect to expend additional resources for expertise in the manufacturing  regulatory affairs and clinical research aspects of biotherapeutic development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  allocated facilities costs and other general corporate expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads we expect the business aspects of the company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
sangamo believes the following critical accounting policies have significant effect in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  revenue from research activities made under strategic partnering agreements is recognized as the services are provided when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
amounts received under such agreements are deferred until the above criteria are met and the research services are performed 
sangamo s federal government research grants are typically multi year agreements and provide for the reimbursement of qualified expenses for research and development as defined under the terms of the grant agreement 
revenue under grant agreements is recognized when the related research expenses are incurred 
grant reimbursements are typically received on a quarterly basis and are subject to the issuing agency s right of audit 
sangamo recognizes revenue from its universal genetools agreements when zfp tfs are delivered to the universal genetools collaborators  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  there are no unfulfilled obligations  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  sangamo receives partial payments from these collaborations prior to the delivery of zfp tfs and the recognition of these revenues is deferred until the zfp tfs are delivered  the risk of ownership has passed to the collaborator and all performance obligations have been satisfied 
upfront or signature payments received upon the signing of a universal genetools agreement are generally recognized ratably over the applicable period of the agreement or as zfp tfs are delivered 
milestone payments under research  partnering  or licensing agreements are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of mutually agreed upon milestones  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii there are no further significant performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  revenue arrangements entered into after june   that include multiple deliverables  are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the fair value of the delivered items can be determined and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criterion is considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
stock based compensation sangamo accounts for employee and director stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
table of contents apb and has adopted the disclosure only alternative of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
stock options granted to non employees  including scientific advisory board members  are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  which requires the value of such options to be measured and compensation expense to be recorded as they vest over a performance period 
the fair value of such options is determined using the black scholes model 
pursuant to fas  as amended by fas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  the effect on net loss and related net loss per share has been calculated  had compensation cost for stock based compensation plans been determined based upon the fair value method prescribed under fas see note organization and summary of significant accounting policies 
goodwill and patents impairment in connection with our acquisition of gendaq limited in july  and also taking into consideration an independent valuation  we allocated million to goodwill and million to patents with estimated useful lives of years  the term of expected benefit 
the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for various products and business strategies 
if any of the significant assumptions differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  this could result in different valuations for goodwill and intangible assets 
once the purchase price allocation is established  we must test goodwill annually for impairment using a two step process as required by fas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  in certain circumstances  we must assess if goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests 
intangible assets with definite useful lives must be tested for impairment in accordance with fas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we conduct our impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles  factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include significant continued under performance compared to peers  significant changes in our underlying business and products  or other factors specific to each asset being evaluated 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
we performed the first of the required annual impairment tests for goodwill as of september   which resulted in a one time charge being taken for the entire balance of goodwill of million 
given that goodwill was determined to be impaired  we also assessed our long lived assets for impairment at that time  resulting in an additional one time charge of million being taken for the entire unamortized balance of patents 
results of operations years ended december   and total revenues year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except percentage values revenues collaboration agreements federal government research grants total revenues we are increasing the emphasis of our research and development activities on zfp therapeutics and are moving away from our historic emphasis on enabling technology agreements 
over the next several years  this change in resource allocation will reduce our revenues 

table of contents total revenues consisted of revenues from collaboration agreements  strategic partnerships and federal government research grants 
revenues from our corporate collaboration and strategic partnering agreements were  in  compared to million in  and million in the decrease in from was principally attributable to lower revenues of approximately  recognized from a therapeutics partnership with edwards lifesciences corporation edwards as well as lower revenues of  associated with universal genetools agreements 
the decrease in revenues under the agreement with edwards is due to completion of our preclinical research and edwards payments for those activities under the agreement 
revenues associated with universal genetools agreements have declined as competing technology has been commoditized and as our emphasis has shifted to therapeutic product development 
the decrease in revenues in from was principally attributable to lower revenues of million associated with universal genetools agreements as well as lower revenues of  recognized from a therapeutics partnership with edwards 
revenues attributable to milestone achievement and collaborative research and development performed under the edwards agreement were  million and million for  and  respectively 
federal government research grant revenues were  in   in  and  in the increase in and over represented the continuation of two grants  one of which began in and the other in  and the introduction of a new grant during the latter portion of we plan to continue to apply for federal government research grants 
operating expenses year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except percentage values operating expenses research and development general and administrative stock based compensation restructuring charge goodwill impairment patent impairment total operating expenses research and development expenses over the past three fiscal years  research and development expenses have consisted primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  laboratory supplies  allocated facilities costs  subcontracted research expenses  and expenses for patent prosecution  trademark registration and technology licenses 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in the future and expect research and development expenses to increase in the next several years if we are successful in advancing our zfp therapeutic product candidates into clinical trials 
to the extent we collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials  increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase of  from to was principally due to pre clinical studies and manufacturing costs of million in connection with our diabetic neuropathy program 
this was partially offset by decreased expenses for salaries and related benefits of  and laboratory supplies of  the decrease of million from to was principally due to the consolidation of the research activities at gendaq  our wholly owned uk subsidiary  into our richmond operations during the third quarter of specifically  decreased expenses were salary and benefits of  lab supplies of  and facility related costs of  our current research and development programs are focused on the advancement of our zfp tf technology for several potential applications 
among these are zfp therapeutics for cardiovascular disease  neurological disorders  cancer and monogenic diseases  zfp tf engineered cell lines for drug screening and

drug development is inherently uncertain and the successful completion of our development programs is subject to numerous technological challenges and risks and we cannot presently estimate anticipated completion dates for any of our programs 
material cash inflows associated with the sale of products  if any  which result from our research efforts are not expected for at least five years 
see risks related to our business our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process  and if these potential products are not approved  we will not be able to commercialize these products and our gene regulation technology is relatively new  and if we are unable to use this technology in all our intended applications  it would limit our revenue opportunities 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  allocated facilities costs and other general corporate expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads  we expect the business aspects of the company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business 
general and administrative expenses were million during  million in and million in the increase of  from to was principally due to programs for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment as well as increased expenses of  related to corporate communications 
general and administrative expenses were consistent from to restructuring charge restructuring charges of  related to the closure of the gendaq facility were recorded in these expenses primarily represent incremental employee restructuring costs and a loss on disposal of fixed assets of

impairment charges during  in accordance with fas no 
 the company performed the required two step annual impairment test of goodwill 
in the first step of the analysis  we compared the carrying value of the company to its fair value and determined that goodwill was impaired 
the fair value of the company was determined using the income approach 
the income approach focuses on the income producing capability of an asset  measuring the current value of the asset by calculating the present value of its future economic benefits such as cash earnings  cost savings  tax benefits and proceeds from disposition incorporating current equity market conditions in the united states  industry specific volatility factors  general equity market forecasts  the risk free rate for the use of funds and the expected rate of inflation 
the company recognized an impairment charge of million  representing the entire capitalized balance of goodwill at the time of the test 
fas requires that if an impairment test of goodwill and any other asset is required at the same time  impairment tests of all other assets should be completed and reflected in the carrying value of the company prior to the completion of the goodwill impairment test 
if it is determined that an asset is not recoverable  fas directs that an impairment loss should be recognized based on the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
impairment tests of the company s long lived assets were conducted in accordance with fas based upon the results of this review  we concluded that the carrying amount of patents was not recoverable 
the company recognized an impairment loss of million  representing the entire unamortized balance of patents 
management assessed all other assets as being recoverable 
interest income  net year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except percentage values interest income  net interest income  net net interest income was  in  as compared to  in  and million in the decline over the three year period reflects lower average cash and investment balances due to the utilization of cash to fund operations

of that gain   represents cumulative currency translation recognized as a result of the closure of our gendaq facility in the uk we incurred net operating losses in  and  and consequently we did not pay any federal or state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments from corporate collaborators  federal government research grants and financing activities such as a bank line of credit 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  investments and interest receivable totaling million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in  and million in in all periods  net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to funding of net operating losses 
during  the use of cash related to the net operating loss of million was partially offset by non cash charges and net increases in asset balances of million and by amortization on investments of  during  the use of cash related to the net operating loss of million was partially offset by non cash charges and net increases in asset balances of million and by amortization on investments of million

net cash provided by used in investing activities was million in   in and million in cash was used during these periods to purchase investments and property and equipment and was offset by the maturities and sale of available for sale securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was  and  in and  respectively  and was solely related to proceeds from issuance of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in of  was related to proceeds from issuance of common stock  partially offset by payments made for an equipment loan 
while we expect our rate of cash usage to increase in the future  in particular  in support of our product development endeavors  we believe that the available cash resources  funds received from corporate collaborators  strategic partners and federal government research grants will be sufficient to finance our operations through we may need to raise additional capital to fund our zfp therapeutic development activities 
additional capital may not be available in terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  our business and our ability to develop our technology and our zfp therapeutic products would be harmed 
there is no provision for income taxes because we have incurred losses 
as of december   sangamo had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through the company also has state operating loss carryforwards of 
table of contents approximately million  which expire in the years through the company also has federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits will begin to expire in the year through and the state research credits have no expiration date 
utilization of the company s net operating loss may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases license obligations total contractual obligations operating leases consist of base rents for facilities we occupy in richmond  california

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r share based payment 
this statement is a revision to sfas and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
this statement requires a public entity to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments 
this statement also provides guidance on valuing and expensing these awards  as well as disclosure requirements of these equity arrangements 
this statement is effective for the first interim reporting period that begins after june  sfas r permits public companies to choose between the following two adoption methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will be depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  valuation of employee stock options under sfas r is similar to sfas  with minor exceptions 
for information about what our reported results of operations and earnings per share would have been had we adopted sfas  please see the discussion under the heading stock based compensation in note to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
due to timing of the release of sfas r  we have not yet completed the analysis of the ultimate impact that this new pronouncement will have on the results of operations  nor the method of adoption for this new standard

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risks 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations
