overview presstek is a market focused high technology company primarily engaged in the manufacture and delivery of digital imaging solutions to the graphic arts and printing industries worldwide 
we are a leader in the development of digital imaging capital equipment and consumables based solutions that are economically beneficial to the user through a streamlined workflow and chemistry free  environmentally responsible operation 
through our various operations  we develop and manufacture products that transfer digital images onto our proprietary chemistry free printing plates  or consumables  using digital laser imaging equipment  targeting primarily the small and medium sized commercial print providers  are a leading sales and services company delivering presstek solutions and those from other manufacturing partners through our abd international business unit  known as abdick  manufacture semiconductor solid state laser diodes for presstek imaging applications and for use by external defense  industrial and medical applications  and manufacture and distribute both chemistry free  digitally imaged printing plates  and printing plates for conventional print applications at our precision lithograining business segment 
we have developed a proprietary system by which digital images are transferred onto printing plates for direct imaging on press applications and for computer to plate applications 
we refer to direct imaging as di and computer to plate as ctp 
our digital imaging systems enable customers to produce high quality  full color lithographic printed materials more quickly and cost effectively than conventional methods that employ more complicated workflows and toxic chemical processing 
this results in reduced printing cycle time and lowers the effective cost of production for commercial printers 
our solutions make it more cost effective for printers to meet the increasing demand for shorter print runs  higher quality color and faster turn around times 
our ground breaking di technology is marketed to leading press manufacturers 
our presstek business segment supplies these manufacturers with imaging kits complete with optical assemblies and software which are integrated into the manufacturers presses 
the result is a di press  which is designed to image our printing plates 
similar digital imaging technologies are used in our ctp systems 
our presstek business segment designs and manufactures ctp systems that incorporate our imaging technology and image our chemistry free printing plates 
lasertel  inc  a subsidiary of presstek  is primarily engaged in the manufacture and development of high powered laser diodes for presstek and for sale to external customers 
lasertel s products include semiconductor lasers and active components for the graphics  defense  industrial  and medical industries 
lasertel offers high powered laser diodes in both standard and customized configurations  including chip on sub mount  un mounted bars  and fiber coupled devices  to support various applications 
on july   we acquired all the stock of precision lithograining corporation  an independent plate manufacturer and its affiliated company sdk realty corp  located in south hadley  massachusetts  for approximately million in cash 
precision manufactures our anthem and freedom digital printing plates  and is also a provider of other conventional analog and digital printing plates for both web and sheet fed printing applications to other external customers 
in november  we completed the acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of the abdick company  through our wholly owned subsidiary  abd international  inc  for approximately million 
abdick manufactures and markets offset systems and digital platemaking systems and related 
table of contents supplies for the graphic arts and printing industries 
as a result of the acquisition of abdick  management is currently finalizing plans to streamline and integrate the operations of abdick with its current operations 
the restructuring plan is expected to be substantially complete by june total costs  primarily for severance and lease commitments  are expected to be approximately million 
although the company believes its estimated exit costs to be reasonable  actual spending for exit activities may differ from current estimated exit costs  which may impact the financial aggregate purchase price 
in addition  the company may incur certain direct acquisition costs subsequent to january   which will increase the total amount of direct acquisition costs included in the aggregate purchase price 
we operate in four reportable segments  i the presstek segment  ii the lasertel segment  iii the precision segment  and iv the abdick segment 
the presstek segment is primarily engaged in the development  manufacture and sale of our patented digital imaging systems and printing plate technologies for direct to press  or on press  applications and ctp  or off press  applications 
the lasertel segment is primarily engaged in the development and manufacture of high powered laser diodes for use by presstek and for sale to external customers 
the precision segment is primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of our patented digital plates for development  as well as digital and analog plates for other customers 
the abdick segment is primarily engaged in the manufacturing  marketing  distribution and sale of offset analog and digital platemaking equipment  consumables and related services for the graphic arts and printing industries 
we generate revenue through four main sources i the sale of our equipment  including di presses  ctp devices  and imaging kits incorporated by leading press manufacturers into direct imaging presses for the graphic arts industry  ii the sale of high powered laser diodes for the industrial and defense industries  iii the sale of our proprietary and non proprietary consumables and supplies  and iv the servicing of offset printing systems and analog and digital platemaking systems 
our business strategy is centered on maximizing the sale of consumable products  and therefore our business efforts focus on the sale of consumable burning engines such as our di presses and ctp devices 
we rely on partnerships with press manufacturers such as ryobi  heidelberg and koenig banner ag  or kba to manufacture presses that use our proprietary consumables 
we also rely on distribution partners  such as kodak polychrome graphic  or kpg  to sell and distribute press and ctp systems and the related proprietary consumable products 
historically we have been reliant on our customer and strategic partner heidelberger druckmaschinen ag heidelberg for a material share of our revenue 
in fiscal  we initiated a process to evaluate our resources and strategically re focus the business 
during this re alignment  we decided to reposition and rescale our resources  and implemented cost savings programs in fiscal and to return to profitability 
we expanded our strategic relationships with other press manufacturers and distributors such as ryobi  kba  and kpg to develop and distribute presses that incorporate our imaging technology and use our proprietary consumables  so as to lessen our reliance on any one partner 
prior to the acquisition of the business of the ab dick company we established a relationship with the company to sell presstek ctp devices and consumables under their brand name 
we are working with other ctp manufacturers to qualify our consumables on their systems 
we believe this shift in strategy fundamentally enhances presstek s ability to expand and control its business 
our revenue for fiscal increased to million  up by million or compared to million in fiscal this increase was due to growth in presstek s core business of million and the addition of revenue from two acquisitions of million in the second half of which significantly contributed to fiscal revenues

we have future contractual payment obligations through that primarily relate to debt  royalty obligations  executive contractual obligations and operating leases 
the following table represents our future commitments at january  more than total less than year years years years credit facilities royalty obligation executive contractual obligations operating leases total contractual obligations additionally  under our credit facilities  interest expense will range from million to million per year over the term of the facility 

table of contents our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal are approximately million  of which million relate primarily to the purchase of capital equipment to be used in the production of our di and ctp equipment and consumable products 
heidelberg is marketing a competitive plate product as an alternative to presstek s pearldry for the quickmaster di 
creo is also marketing a competitive plate product as an alternative to presstek s pearldry for both the ryobi and quickmaster dl platforms 
these competitive plates have impacted the revenue generated by presstek under its agreement with heidelberg and ryobi  including the oem consumables supply agreements with heidelberg and heidelberg usa entered into in july they could also lead to downward pricing pressure on our full line of spooled consumable products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
presstek has initiated patent infringement action against the heidelberg and creo products in the federal republic of germany and the united states  respectively 
we believe that existing funds  cash flows from operations  and cash available under our new revolver should be sufficient to satisfy working capital requirements and capital expenditures through the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not require additional financing  or that such additional financing  if needed  will be available on acceptable terms 
effect of inflation inflation has not had  and is not expected to have  a material impact on our financial conditions or results of operations 
net operating loss carryforwards as of january   we had net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately million  of which million resulted from stock option compensation deductions for tax purposes and million resulted from operating losses 
to the extent net operating losses resulting from stock option compensation deductions become realizable  the benefit will be credited directly to additional paid in capital 
the amount of the net operating loss carryforwards that may be utilized in any future period may be subject to certain limitations  based upon changes in the ownership of our common stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates general presstek s management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as adopted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  presstek evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  long lived assets  warranty obligations  and litigation 
presstek bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
revenue recognition the company generates revenue through four main sources  equipment sales  laser diode sales  consumable sales and the sale of installation services  training  support services and equipment maintenance contracts 

table of contents the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured  and no future services are required 
the company records revenue for product sales net of estimated returns  which are adjusted periodically  based upon historical rates of return 
equipment revenue and any related royalties for products sold to original equipment manufacturers is recognized at the time of shipment 
contracts with oem s do not include price protection or product return rights 
revenue for equipment sold to distributors  whereby the distributor is responsible for installation  is recognized at shipment 
revenue for equipment sold to distributors whereby the company is responsible for installation  for which the installation is not deemed inconsequential  is recognized upon completion of installation and customer acceptance 
contracts with distributors do not include price protection or product return rights  however the company may elect in certain circumstances to accept returns for product 
revenue for installation services is recognized after installation has occurred 
revenue related to service maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the duration of the particular contract 
revenue for training and support services is recognized upon completion of the training and services 
certain fees and other reimbursements are recognized as revenue when the related services have been performed or the revenue otherwise earned 
deferred revenue includes certain customer advances received as a result of the company s distribution agreements and service maintenance agreements 
this revenue is recognized as product is shipped or services are performed 
the company may enter into multiple element arrangements and follows emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple arrangements 
based upon the criteria contained in eitf no 
 the company has determined that its deliverables within multiple elements revenue arrangements represent separate units of accounting 
revenue is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative fair values of the individual units of accounting 
a general right of return or cancellation does not exist once the product is delivered to the customer 
the company accounts for shipping and handling fees passed on to customers as revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts presstek evaluates its accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific customer circumstances and on its historical rate of write offs 
we include any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible  along with a general reserve  in an overall allowance for doubtful accounts 
after reasonable attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts as of january  is adequate 
however  actual write offs might exceed the recorded allowance 
product warranties presstek warrants its products against defects in material and workmanship for various periods  determined by the product  generally from a period of ninety days to a period of one year from the date of installation 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we assess the recoverability of inventory to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory that is in excess of future requirements is written down to its estimated value based upon forecasted demand for its products 
if actual demand is less favorable than what has been forecasted by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets presstek has goodwill and net intangible assets excluding patents of million at january  we are required to evaluate the impairment annually of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets and property and equipment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets 
an impairment charge would be recorded if such as assessment were to indicate that the fair value of such assets was less than the carrying value 
judgment is required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 
factors that could indicate that an impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  strategic changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
we must make assumptions about future cash flows  future operating plans  discount rates and other factors in the models and valuation reports 
different assumptions and judgment determination could yield different conclusions that would result in an impairment charge to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
for purposes of the annual impairment test  which will occur on july   goodwill of million has been assigned to the precision business segment and million has been assigned to the abdick business segment 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
to do this  we estimate our actual current tax liabilities  while also assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and expense accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
to the extent we reverse any portion of the valuation allowance  we must recognize a benefit within the tax provision in the statement of operations or to additional paid in capital for the benefit of deductions for stock option exercises 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in determining whether to establish a valuation reserve for its deferred tax loss assets presstek considered its historic lack of substantial taxable profits  its internal projections concerning future taxable operations  the assumptions underlying such projections and the likelihood of achieving such future taxable operations 
presstek determined that there is sufficient uncertainty with respect to its ability to achieve profitable operations in future periods that we cannot justify the recording of an income tax asset and  accordingly  we established a valuation reserve in the full amount of its deferred tax assets 
as a result of the acquisitions of precision and abdick  we recorded a deferred tax liability that relates to the us goodwill which is considered indefinite lived 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  sfas no 
amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and spoilage 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal which was the criterion specified in arb no 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of the production be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
this pronouncement is effective for the company beginning october  the company has not yet assessed the impact of adopting this new standard 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 

table of contents sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  the company is currently evaluating the two methods of adoption allowed by sfas r  the modified prospective transition method and the modified retrospective transition method 
adoption of sfas r will materially increase stock compensation expense and decrease net income 
in addition  sfas r requires that the excess tax benefits related to stock compensation be reported as a cash inflow from financing activities rather than as a reduction of taxes paid in cash from operations

we are substantially dependent on heidelberg for a portion of our revenue and the loss of heidelberg as a customer or a significant reduction in revenue from sales to heidelberg would adversely affect our business 
we have had an important long term relationship with heidelberg 
since entering into our strategic alliance with heidelberg  our sales of products to heidelberg have constituted a material portion of our total revenue 
for our  and fiscal years our sales to heidelberg accounted for approximately   and  respectively of our total revenue 
there can be no assurance that our relationship with heidelberg will continue 
the loss of heidelberg as a customer  or a material decrease in the revenue we receive from direct imaging kit sales or consumable sales to heidelberg  would have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
heidelberg is marketing a competitive plate product  as an alternative to presstek s pearldry for the quickmaster di 
the introduction of a competitive plate could reduce the revenue generated by presstek under its agreements with heidelberg  including the oem agreements entered into in july it could also lead to downward pricing pressure on our full line of spooled consumable products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we currently have no orders from heidelberg for direct imaging kits used in the quickmaster di 
heidelberg has recently indicated  as a result of the global economic slowdown  that it had a sufficient inventory of direct imaging kits on hand to support its production requirements for six months 
we have no reason to believe that orders for direct imaging kits will resume in fiscal 
table of contents we are substantially dependent on our strategic alliance  as well as our manufacturing and distribution relationships to develop and grow our business 
the loss or failure of one or more of our strategic partners could significantly harm our business 
our business strategy to date has included entering into strategic alliances with major companies in the graphic arts industry and other markets 
the implementation of this strategy has included  among other things  licensing our intellectual property  developing specialized products based on our proprietary technologies and manufacturing imaging systems for inclusion in other manufacturers products 
our strategy has also involved identifying strategic manufacturing and distribution partners to aid in developing new market channels for our products 
this strategy led to the development of our relationship with heidelberg 
it also led to the development of relationships with other strategic partners  including kba  ryobi and kpg 
we are dependent on many of these partners for future sales of both existing and planned products 
this means that the timetable for finalizing development  commercialization and distribution of both existing and planned products is dependent upon the needs and circumstances of our strategic partners 
we have experienced and will continue to experience technical difficulties from time to time  which may prevent us from meeting certain production and distribution targets 
any delay in meeting production and distribution targets with our strategic partners may harm our relationships with them and may cause them to terminate their relationship with us 
our strategic partners may not develop markets for our products at the pace or in the manner we expect  which may have an adverse effect on our business 
they may also terminate their relationships with us for circumstances beyond our control  including factors unique to their businesses or their business decisions 
in addition  we may mutually agree with one or more of our partners to terminate our relationship with them for a variety of reasons 
for example  in march  we agreed with xerox to terminate our supply and distribution agreement with them for docucolor di presses 
as a result  xerox no longer sells the docucolor di  the docucolor di and the docucolor di presses and related consumables 
while we do not believe the termination of our relationship with xerox has had a material adverse impact on our business  we cannot assure you that the termination of any of our other relationships with our strategic partners will not have an adverse impact on our business in the future 
we are also unable to control factors related to the businesses of our strategic partners 
as an example  in february  adast  a past manufacturing partner of ours  announced that it had joined a bankruptcy petition filed by its creditors 
as a result of this development  we adjusted our fiscal fourth quarter net income and balance sheet to include an additional write off of approximately million to cover prepayments made to adast for work in progress 
there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur with our other strategic partners 
given the uncertainties surrounding many of our strategic partners  there can be no assurance that our existing strategic relationships will prove successful 
there can also be no assurance that our existing relationships with heidelberg  kba  ryobi  or kpg or any of our other strategic  manufacturing or distribution partners will be successful 
the loss of heidelberg  kba  ryobi  kpg or other principal customers or strategic partners could have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
while we continue to explore possibilities for additional strategic relationships and alliances  there can be no assurance we will be successful in this regard 
our failure to develop new relationships and alliances could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
our acquisition of abdick may affect our relationship with our third party distribution and service partners  which may negatively affect our sales and distribution channels 
prior to the addition of abdick  distribution and service of our ctp products was performed by our third party partners  including pitman and xpedex and a series of independent dealers 
additionally  the distribution and service of our di products were provided by oem and other third party partners  including heidelberg  kba and kpg 
with the addition of abdick  we plan to utilize our newly acquired distribution and service organization as a new channel through which to sell and service our products  as a supplement to our existing distribution network 
at this time  we are not aware of any conflicts between our existing channel and or oem partners associated with the initiation of this channel 
however  there can be no guarantees that the establishment of this new distribution channel will not cause conflict with our existing distribution and oem partners  which could have an adverse effect on our relationship with our distribution and or oem partners  which could result in our sales being negatively affected 

table of contents any failure by us to manage acquisitions successfully could harm our financial results  business and prospects 
the operations of presstek have substantially changed over the last twelve months as a result of the acquisitions of precision and abdick and will continue to evolve through as we integrate these two businesses 
as part of our business strategy  over the next few years  we may further expand our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses worldwide 
we cannot assure you that we will be able successfully to integrate any future acquisitions  which could adversely impact our long term competitiveness and profitability 
any future acquisitions will involve a number of risks that could harm our financial condition  results of operations and competitive position 
in particular the integration process could disrupt the activities of the businesses that are being combined 
the combination of the businesses or plants may require  among other things  coordination of administrative and other functions and consolidation of production capacity 
plant consolidation may strain our ability to deliver products of acceptable quality in a timely manner from consolidated facilities 
we may experience attrition among the skilled labor force at the companies acquired in reaction to being acquired and in reaction to our consolidation of plants 
the execution of our integration plans may divert the attention of our management from operating our existing business 
we may assume known and unanticipated liabilities and contingencies 
future acquisitions could cause a reduction of our reported earnings because of the use of capital  the issuance of additional securities or debt  increased interest expense  goodwill write offs and an increased income tax rate 
with respect to our strategic plan to grow in part through acquisitions  we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions at acceptable prices or that we will have access to sufficient capital to take advantage of desirable acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that our future acquisitions will have revenues  profits or productivity comparable to those of our past acquisitions 
future acquisitions may require substantial capital 
although we expect to use borrowings under our senior credit facility to pursue these opportunities  we cannot assure you that such borrowings will be available in sufficient amounts or that other financing will be available in amounts and on terms that we deem acceptable 
our financial performance and the condition of the capital markets will affect the value of our common stock  which could make it a less attractive form of consideration for making acquisitions 
our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict when or if sales will occur and therefore we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues 
our products have a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our operating results 
customers view the purchase of our products as a significant capital outlay and  therefore  a strategic decision 
as a result  customers generally evaluate our products and determine their impact on existing infrastructure over a lengthy period of time 
our sales cycle has historically ranged from approximately one to six months based on the customer s need to rapidly implement a solution and whether the customer is new or is extending an existing implementation 
the sale of our products may be subject to delays if the customer has lengthy internal budgeting  approval and evaluation processes 
we may incur significant selling and marketing expenses during a customer s evaluation period 
larger customers may purchase our products as part of multiple simultaneous purchasing decisions  which may result in additional unplanned administrative processing and other delays in the recognition of our revenues 
if revenues forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized or are delayed to another quarter  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
we may not be able to increase revenues if we do not expand our sales and distribution channels 
we will need to expand our global sales operations in order to increase market awareness and acceptance of our line of products and generate increased revenues 
we market and distribute our products indirectly through our global partner and distributor network and directly in europe through our abdick uk subsidiary 
we believe that our future success is dependent upon expansion of global distribution channels 
we cannot be certain that we will be 
table of contents able to maintain our current relationships or establish new relationships with additional distribution partners on a timely basis  or at all 
with the addition of abdick  we plan to utilize our newly acquired distribution and service organization as a new channel through which to sell and service our products  as a supplement to our existing distribution network 
at this time  we are not aware of any conflicts between our existing channel and or oem partners associated with the initiation of this channel 
however  there can be no guarantees that the establishment of this new distribution channel will not cause conflict with our existing distribution and oem partners  which could have an adverse effect on our relationship with our distribution and or oem partners  which could result in our sales being negatively affected 
in march  we expanded our product offerings to select dealers in our european distribution channel to include the sale of quickmaster di consumables 
in connection with this offering  we reduced pricing on our full line of spooled consumables distributed through this distribution channel by up to 
while the expected lost revenue resulting from the price reduction may be offset by increased revenue from increased volume of spooled consumable sales derived from additional presses installed and increased usage of spooled consumables  there can be no assurance that the expected lost revenue will be offset 
in addition  market conditions may require us to expand the regions in which we offer reduced prices  or to further reduce our spooled consumable prices  which could further reduce our revenues in and beyond 
though this has not had a material adverse effect on our business  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
our growth strategy may include licenses or acquisitions of technologies or businesses  which entail a number of risks 
as part of our strategy to grow our business  we may pursue licenses of technologies from third parties or acquisitions of complementary products lines or companies  and such transactions entail a number of risks 
we may expend significant costs in investigating and pursuing such transactions  and such transactions may not be consummated 
if such transactions are consummated  we may not be successful in integrating the acquired technology or business into our existing business to achieve the desired synergies 
integrating acquired technologies or businesses may also require a substantial commitment of our management s time and attention 
we may expend significant funds to acquire such technologies or businesses  and we may incur unforeseen liabilities in connection with any acquisition of a technology or business 
for instance  as a result of our acquisition of certain assets from the abdick company completed in november  we expect to incur an additional million in integration and restructuring costs over the next several quarters  in addition to the million in acquisition related expenses already incurred 
any of the foregoing risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial conditions 
we face risks associated with our efforts to expand into international market and such risks could result in diversion of our management s attention from our existing business and or cause us to incur additional expected and unexpected costs associated with penetrating  operating in and servicing such markets  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 
we intend to expand our global sales operations and enter additional international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
international sales are subject to a variety of risks  including difficulties in establishing and managing international distribution channels  in serving and supporting products sold outside the united states and in translating products and related materials into foreign languages 
international operations are also subject to difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  staffing and managing personnel and enforcing intellectual property rights 
other factors that can adversely affect international operations include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates  changes in import export duties and quotas  introduction of tariff or non tariff barriers and economic or political changes in international markets 
if our international sales increase  our revenues may also be affected to a greater extent by seasonal fluctuations resulting from lower levels of sales that typically occur during the summer months in europe and other parts of the world 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have experienced losses in the past  could incur substantial losses in the future  and may not be able to maintain profitability 
we have incurred substantial net losses from continuing operations in three of the past five fiscal years 
we incurred net losses from continuing operations of approximately million for fiscal  and million for fiscal as of january  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 
table of contents million 
we may need to generate significant increases in revenues to maintain profitability  and we may not be able to do so 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate  due to potential competitive pricing pressures  or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenues  our business will be materially adversely affected 
even if we maintain profitability in the future on a quarterly or annual basis  we may not be able to sustain or increase such profitability 
failure to sustain profitability may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are sometimes difficult to predict  have varied in the past  and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
we typically realize a significant percentage of our revenues for a fiscal quarter in the third month of the quarter 
accordingly  our quarterly results may be difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter 
any inability to obtain sufficient orders or to fulfill shipments in the period immediately preceding the end of any particular quarter may cause the results for that quarter to fail to meet our revenue targets 
in addition  we base our current and future expense levels in part on our estimates of future revenues 
our expenses are largely fixed in the short term and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly if our revenues fall short of our expectations 
accordingly  a revenue shortfall in a particular quarter would have an adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate for many reasons  including  without limitation a long and unpredictable sales cycle  changes in demand for our products and consumables  including seasonal differences  and changes in the mix of our products and consumables 
we are dependent on third party suppliers for critical components and our inability to maintain an adequate supply of advanced laser diodes and other critical components could adversely affect us 
we are dependent on third party suppliers for critical components and our increased demand for these components may strain the ability of our third party suppliers to deliver such critical components in a timely manner 
for example  our requirements for advanced technology laser diodes for use in products incorporating our di technology has increased and is expected to further increase in the future 
although we have established our subsidiary  lasertel  to help us meet our demand for laser diodes  we are still dependent on other third party manufacturers to supply us with other necessary components 
if we are unable for any reason to secure an uninterrupted source of other critical components at prices acceptable to us  our operations could be materially adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that lasertel will be able to manufacture advanced laser diodes in quantities that will fulfill our future needs  or with manufacturing volumes or yields that will make our operation cost effective 
likewise  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain alternative suppliers for our laser diodes or other critical components should our current supply channels prove inadequate 
our manufacturing capabilities may be insufficient to meet the demand for our products 
if demand for our products grows beyond our expectations  our current manufacturing capabilities may be insufficient to meet this demand  resulting in production delays and a failure to deliver products in a timely fashion 
we may be forced to seek alternative manufacturers for our products 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully be able to do so 
as we introduce new products  we may face production and manufacturing delays due to technical and other unforeseen problems 
any manufacturing delay could have an adverse effect on our business  the success of any product affected by the delay  and our revenue  and may harm our relationships with our strategic partners 
recently introduced products that incorporate our technology may not be commercially successful and may not gain market acceptance 
achieving market acceptance for any products incorporating our technology requires substantial marketing and distribution efforts and expenditure of significant sums of money and allocation of significant resources  either by us  our strategic partners or both 
we may not have sufficient resources to do so 
additionally  there can be no assurance that products introduced by our strategic partners  such as the karat di presses  and the kpg di presses  or our product offerings such as our anthem plates  and dimension and dimension platesetters  will achieve widespread market acceptance or that any of our other current products or any future products that we may develop or any future products produced by others that 
table of contents incorporate our technologies will achieve market acceptance or become commercially successful 
we recently announced the commercial release of our new applause plate 
there can be no assurance that this plate will  or that will achieve market acceptance 
if our new product offerings do not achieve anticipated market acceptance  we may not achieve anticipated revenue 
recently introduced products that incorporate our technology may result in substantial support costs and warranty expenditures 
introducing new products carries substantial risk 
while we do substantial testing on our new products before introducing them to our customers  no amount of testing can replace or approximate actual field conditions at our customer locations 
as a result  when we introduce new products we can incur increased expenditures in ensuring that the new product meets and performs in accordance with its specifications 
we cannot  however  always estimate precisely the expected costs that may arise out of new product installations 
as an example of this  we incurred increased warranty and support costs in fiscal and due to unanticipated product performance issues associated with our new dimension product line 
there can be no assurance that we will not incur increased warranty  support and other costs associated with new product introductions in the future 
in addition  the occurrence of these expenditures may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if the united states and global economies slow down  the demand for our products could decrease and our revenue may be materially adversely affected 
the demand for our products is dependent upon various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for example  general economic conditions affect or delay the overall capital spending by businesses and consumers  particularly for capital equipment such as presses 
an economic slowdown in the us and abroad could result in a decrease in spending and spending projections on capital equipment that could impact the demand for our products 
if  as a result of general economic uncertainty or otherwise  companies reduce their product spending levels  such a decrease in spending could substantially reduce demand for our products  substantially harm our business  and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the price of our common stock may be negatively affected 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires that we report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
among other things  we must perform systems and processes evaluation and testing 
we must also conduct an assessment of our internal controls to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in connection with the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting for this form k  while no material weaknesses were identified  deficiencies in areas of our internal controls which need improvement were discovered 
in addition  in the future  our continued assessment  or the subsequent assessment by our independent registered public accounting firm  may reveal additional deficiencies  or material weaknesses in our internal controls which need to be disclosed in future reports 
as our assessment of internal control over financial reporting in connection with this form k excluded abdick and precision  the subsequent assessment of internal controls including abdick and precision may reveal such deficiencies and or material weaknesses 
disclosures of material weaknesses could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reporting and may negatively affect the price of our common stock 
moreover  effective internal controls are necessary to produce reliable financial reports and to prevent fraud 
if we have deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting  it may negatively impact our business and operations 
the expansion of lasertel into areas other than the production of laser diodes for our printing business may be unsuccessful 
lasertel  which was formed for the purpose of supplying us with laser diodes  has also explored other markets for its laser technology 
these efforts to develop other markets were scaled back  in part  in june  as we announced a repositioning of lasertel in order to reduce its costs and focus its efforts on supplying us with high quality laser diodes 
while the plans to market its laser products to the telecommunications industry were delayed  lasertel has developed laser products for the defense industry and has continued its plans to develop laser prototypes for qualification in the defense and industrial industries 
there can be no assurance that these products or prototypes will gain acceptance in these industries and likewise  there can be no assurance that these products will be commercially successful 
our executive team has limited experience in the 
table of contents telecommunications  defense and industrial industries and there can be no assurance that lasertel will be able to successfully exploit any opportunities that may arise 
the failure of lasertel to develop  commercialize or sell its products or future products to various other industries could distract its managements attention and or have an adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations  any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition 
conversely  any success that lasertel achieves in developing  commercializing or selling its products or future products to various other industries could cause delays in manufacturing of the laser diodes that it supplies to us  which could harm our business and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
lasertel may require additional working capital infusions from us  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
lasertel has required and may continue to require a significant amount of capital investment by presstek in order to fund its operations 
for the fiscal year ended january   lasertel recorded a net loss of million 
lasertel continues to require us to advance cash and resources in order to ensure its continued operation 
lasertel has only had sales to a limited number of third parties to date  and any loss of such customers or significant reduction in their purchases from lasertel could increase its reliance upon us for capital and resources 
further  lasertel has advanced million to one of its customers  the loan being secured by  among other things a lien on the assets of the customer 
failure by this customer to repay this advance could have a adverse affect on lasertel s operations 
lasertel s capital and working capital needs may exceed our ability to provide such funds  requiring us to borrow against our credit facilities or seek to obtain outside financing for lasertel s operations 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success is dependent on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary rights 
our future success will depend  in large part  upon our intellectual property rights  including patents  trademarks  trade secrets  proprietary know how  source codes and continuing technological innovation 
we have been issued a number of us and foreign patents and we intend to register for additional patents where we deem appropriate 
we also hold seven registered trademarks and we may register additional trademarks where we deem appropriate 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the issuance of any additional patents or trademarks or the breadth or degree of protection that our patents  trademarks or other intellectual property may afford us 
the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not adequately prevent misappropriation or ensure that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
further  the laws of certain territories in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
there is rapid technological development in the electronic image reproduction industries  resulting in extensive patent filings and a rapid rate of issuance of new patents 
although we believe that our technology has been independently developed and that the products we market do not infringe the patents or violate other proprietary rights of others  it is possible that such infringement of existing or future patents or violation of proprietary rights may occur 
in this regard  third parties may in the future assert claims against us concerning our existing products or with respect to future products under development by us 
in such event  we may be required to modify our product designs or obtain a license 
no assurance can be given that we would be able to do so in a timely manner  upon acceptable terms and conditions or even at all 
the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
furthermore  we have agreements with several of our strategic partners which require us to indemnify the strategic partner from claims made by third parties against our intellectual property  and to defend the validity of the patents or otherwise ensure the technology s availability to the strategic partner 
an indemnification claim under any such agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in august  the company was served with a purported securities class action lawsuit filed on june  in the united states district court for the districts of new hampshire against the company and two of its former officers 
this lawsuit was dismissed by the court on october  however  the plaintiffs in the case have appealed the court s dismissal on november  on january   the plaintiffs of this matter withdrew their appeal and the matter was permanently closed in presstek s favor 

table of contents in march  presstek filed an action against creo  inc  in the united states district court for the district of new hampshire for patent infringement 
in this action  presstek alleges that creo has distributed a product that violates a presstek us patent 
presstek seeks an order from the court that creo refrain from offering the infringing product for sale  from using the infringing material or introducing it for the named purposes  or from possessing such infringing material  and for the payment of damages associated with the infringement 
in september  presstek filed an action against fuji photo film corporation  ltd  in the district court of mannheim  germany for patent infringement 
in this action  presstek alleges that fuji has manufactured and distributed a product that violates presstek european patent registered under number de with the german patent and trademark office 
presstek seeks an order from the court that fuji refrain from offering the infringing product for sale  from using the infringing material or introducing it for the named purposes  and from possessing such infringing material 
we may take legal action to determine the validity and scope of third party rights or to defend against any allegations of infringement 
in the course of pursuing or defending any of these actions we could incur significant costs and diversion of our resources 
due to the competitive nature of our industry  it is unlikely that we could increase our product prices to cover such costs 
there can be no assurance that we will have the financial or other resources necessary to successfully defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action 
moreover  we may be unable  for financial or other reasons  to enforce our rights under any patents we may own 
as an example of the cost and uncertainty of patent litigation  in august creo filed an action in the united states district court for the district of delaware against us seeking a declaration that creo s products do not and will not infringe any valid and enforceable claims of any of our patents in question 
we counterclaimed against creo for patent infringement of certain of our patents 
the matter went to trial in june  and in september  the court affirmed the validity and enforceability of our on press imaging patents  but held that the current creo dop system did not infringe on our patents 
creo appealed the court s decision that our patents were valid and enforceable  and we cross appealed the finding of non infringement by the current creo dop system 
on september   the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the lower court s decision that our patents are valid and enforceable  but that they are not infringed by the current creo dop system 
we incurred higher than expected legal expenses in fiscal and fiscal due to this litigation 
any similar litigation in the future is expected to be costly  yield uncertain results and could have a material effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also rely on proprietary know how and employ various methods to protect the source codes  concepts  trade secrets  ideas and documentation relating to our proprietary software and laser diode technology 
however  such methods may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop such know how or obtain access to our know how or software codes  concepts  trade secrets  ideas and documentation 
although we have and expect to have confidentiality agreements with our employees and appropriate vendors  there can be no assurance  however  that such arrangements will adequately protect our trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we face substantial competition in the sale of our products 
we compete with manufacturers of conventional presses and products utilizing existing plate making technology  as well as presses and other products utilizing new technologies  including other types of direct to plate solutions such as companies that employ electrophotography as their imaging technology 
canon inc  hewlett packard company  kodak and xerox corporation are companies that have introduced color electrophotographic copier products 
various companies are marketing product versions manufactured by these companies 
we are also aware that there is a trend in the graphic arts industry to create stand alone computer to plate imaging devices for single and multi color applications 
most of the major corporations in the graphic arts industry have developed and or are developing and marketing off press computer to plate imaging systems 
to date  devices manufactured by our competitors  for the most part  utilize printing plates that require a post imaging photochemical developing step  and in some cases  also require a heating process 
potential competitors in this area include  among others  agfa gevaert nv  dai nippon screen manufacturing ltd  heidelberg and creo 

table of contents we also anticipate competition from plate manufacturing companies that manufacture printing plates  or have the potential to manufacture digital thermal plates 
these companies include agfa gevaert nv  kpg and fuji photo film co  ltd 
heidelberg is marketing a competitive plate product as an alternative to presstek s pearldry for the quickmaster di 
the introduction of a competitive plate could reduce the revenue generated by presstek under its relationship with heidelberg  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
products incorporating our technologies can also be expected to face competition from conventional methods of printing and creating printing plates 
most of the companies marketing competitive products  or with the potential to do so  are well established  have substantially greater financial  marketing and distribution resources than us and have established reputations for success in the development  sale and service of products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 
while we believe we have strong intellectual property protection covering many of our technologies  there is no assurance that the breadth or degree of such protection will be sufficient to prohibit or otherwise delay the introduction of competitive products or technologies 
the introduction of competitive products and technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to adequately respond to changes in technology affecting the printing industry 
our continuing product development efforts have focused on refining and improving the performance of our pearl and di technology and our consumables and we anticipate that we will continue to focus such efforts 
the printing and publishing industry has been characterized in recent years by rapid and significant technological changes and frequent new product introductions 
current competitors or new market entrants could introduce new or enhanced products with features  which render our technologies  or products incorporating our technologies  obsolete or less marketable 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to use leading technologies effectively  continue to develop our technical expertise and patented position  enhance our current products and develop new products that meet changing customer needs  time new product introductions in a way that minimizes the impact of customers delaying purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product releases  adjust the prices of our existing products to increase customer demand  successfully advertise and market our products  and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
we must respond to changing technology and industry standards in a timely and cost effective manner 
we may not be successful in effectively using new technologies  developing new products or enhancing our existing products and technology on a timely basis 
our new technologies or enhancements may not achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of new technologies may require substantial time and expense 
we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change 
these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept 
finally  we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge 
ongoing litigation could have an adverse impact on our business 
from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  we may be subject to lawsuits 
for instance  on september   presstek filed an action against fuji photo film corporation  ltd 
in the district court of mannheim  germany for patent infringement 
also  in august  the company was served with a purported securities class action lawsuit filed on june  in the united states district court for the districts of new hampshire against the company and two of its former officers 
this lawsuit was dismissed by the court on october  the plaintiffs have appealed the court s dismissal on november  on january   the plaintiffs of this matter withdrew their appeal and the matter was permanently closed in presstek s favor 
while the foregoing suit was resolved in favor of presstek  an unfavorable outcome in connection with a future lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

presstek is party to other litigation that it considers routine and incidental to its business however it does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operation or financial condition 
the loss or unavailability of our key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the success of presstek is largely dependent on the personal efforts of our senior management team 
we have recently entered into three year employment agreements with ed marino  our president and chief executive officer  and moosa e 
moosa  our executive vp and chief financial officer 
the loss or interruption of the services of either or both of messrs 
marino or moosa could have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 
our success may also be dependent on our ability to hire and retain additional qualified engineering  technical  sales  marketing and other personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry can be intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel 
our stock price has been and could continue to be extremely volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations 
the securities markets  and the nasdaq national market in particular  have experienced  and are likely to experience in the future  significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements by us or other industry participants  changes in national or regional economic conditions  changes in securities analysts estimates for us  our competitors or our industry or our failure to meet analysts expectations  and general market conditions 
these factors may materially and adversely affect our stock price  regardless of our operating performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our acquisition of abdick  we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
any foreign currency transactions  defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  will be reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period 
the primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on the balance sheet 
therefore  the change in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we also have some exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a limited number of our sales and purchase transactions are denominated in the european euro and the japanese yen 
in addition  some of our customers and strategic partners are not located in the united states 
as a result  these customers and strategic partners are themselves subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
if their home country currency were to decrease in value relative to the united states dollar  their ability to purchase and market our products could be adversely affected and our products may become less competitive to them 
this may have an adverse impact on our business 
likewise  some of our suppliers are not located in the united states 
table of contents and thus  such suppliers are subject to foreign exchange rate risks in transactions with us 
decreases in the value of their home country currency  versus that of the united states dollar  could cause fluctuations in supply pricing which could have an adverse effect on our business 
we also are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities  and to a lesser extent  our investing activities 
our long term borrowings are in variable rate instruments  with interest rates tied to either the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor 
a basis point change in these rates would have an impact of approximately  on our annual interest expense  assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held as of the end of fiscal
