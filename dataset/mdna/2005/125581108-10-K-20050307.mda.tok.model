item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion uses financial terms that we believe to be relevant to our business 
a glossary of other key terms used in our business can be found in part i item business section 
introduction our primary sources of revenue are interest and rental income related to collateralized lending and equipment leasing 
finance receivables loans and capital leases and operating lease equipment operating leases are the two major asset types that generate this revenue 
in the case of finance receivables which are financial assets  the substantive risks and rewards of equipment and other collateralized asset ownership belong to the customer and we retain predominantly the borrower credit risk 
with operating lease equipment  we retain the substantive risks and rewards of equipment ownership  including depreciation benefits and the risk of damage or obsolescence 
we fund our leasing and lending activity via the global capital markets  using commercial paper  unsecured term debt  and securitizations 
we refer to the excess of our interest and rental income over our interest expense as net finance margin 
this revenue is supplemented by other non spread sources of revenue  such as syndication fees  gains from dispositions of equipment  factoring commissions  servicing of loans and other fees 
we measure our overall level of profitability with the following metrics o net income as a percentage of average earning assets aea  o net income per common share eps  o net income as a percentage of average tangible equity rote  and o net income as a percentage of average equity roe 
we believe that the keys to enhancing profitability in our business are as follows net interest margin our ability to lend money at rates in excess of our cost of borrowing 
we measure this with the following ratios o finance income as a percentage of aea  and o net finance income as a percentage of aea 
funding and market rate risk management our ability to access funding sources at competitive rates  which depends on maintaining high quality assets  strong capital ratios and high credit ratings 
this profitability key is also a function of interest rate and currency rate risk management  where the goal is to substantially insulate our interest margins and profits from movements in market interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we gauge our funding and interest rate risk management activities with various measurements  including the following o interest expense as a percentage of aea  o net finance margin as a percentage of aea  and o various interest sensitivity and liquidity measurements that are discussed in net finance margin and risk management 
equipment and residual risk management our ability to evaluate collateral risk in leasing and lending transactions and to remarket equipment at lease termination 
we measure these activities with the following o operating lease margin as a percentage of average leased equipment  o gains and losses on equipment sales  and o equipment utilization value of equipment off lease 
credit risk management our ability to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers  both during the credit granting process and after the advancement of funds  and to maintain high quality assets while balancing income potential with adequate credit loss reserve levels 
we assess our credit risk management activities with the following measurements o net charge offs as a percentage of average finance receivables  o delinquent assets as a percentage of finance receivables  o non performing assets as a percentage of finance receivables  o reserve for credit losses as a percentage of finance receivables  of delinquent assets  and of non performing assets  and o concentration risk management 
expense management our ability to maintain efficient operating platforms and infrastructure in order to run our business at competitive cost levels 
we track our efficiency with the following measurements o efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of salaries and general operating expenses to operating margin excluding the provision for credit losses  and o operating expenses as a percentage of average managed assets ama 
asset generation and growth our ability to originate new business and build our earning assets in a focused and prudent manner 
we measure our performance in these areas with the following o origination volumes  o levels of financing and leasing assets  and managed assets including securitized finance receivables that we continue to manage  and o levels of non spread and other revenue 
capital management our ability to maintain a strong capital base 
we measure our performance in these areas with the following o tangible capital base  and o tangible equity to managed assets ratio 
profitability and key business trends profitability measurements for the respective periods are presented in the table below years ended three months december  ended year ended december  september  net income per diluted share net income as a percentage of aea return on average tangible equity managed assets grew during to billion  following growth in consistent with  our focus in was on prudent growth  as we continued to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions that integrated well with existing business platforms 
aided by an improving economy  this approach to growth and risk management led to continued declines in delinquency  non performing assets and charge off levels from the ratio of tangible stockholders equity to managed assets strengthened to at december   versus and at the end of the prior two years 
during  we also executed on our strategy to allocate capital to businesses with higher risk adjusted returns through the continued liquidation of non strategic portfolios 
as part of this strategy  during the fourth quarter of  we contracted to sell over million of manufactured housing receivables and approximately million of venture capital fund investments 
these actions were consistent with similar sale and syndication initiatives earlier in and in including the impact of the recently announced student lending business acquisition and the fourth quarter accelerated liquidations  we believe that our capital is adequate 
expense efficiency measurements for deteriorated from the prior year  reflecting increases in both revenue generation costs expenses related to acquired businesses  incentive based compensation  enhancement maintenance costs related to aerospace and rail operating lease assets and administrative costs professional services and other compliance related costs  credit and collection expenses 
improvement in expense efficiency is a primary corporate goal for accordingly  several initiatives are underway to reduce costs  including systems consolidations and process efficiency reviews 
the following table summarizes the impact of various items for the respective reporting periods that affect the comparability of our financial results under gaap 
we are presenting these items as a supplement to the gaap results to facilitate the comparability of results between periods

during and  we recognized a gain on the redemption of certain debt instruments 
in  we took specific reserving actions and recorded other charges 
a portion of the remaining specific reserves were reduced through net income in the exclusion of these transactions aids in the analysis of results over the periods presented 
the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in october introduced goodwill impairment charges 
the impairment charge in the period ended september  was a non cash charge and did not impact our tangible capital 
the tch results relate to a tyco acquisition company that had temporary status with respect to tyco s acquisition of cit 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk contain certain non gaap financial measures 
see non gaap financial measurements for additional information 
the sections that follow analyze our results by financial statement caption and are referenced back to the profitability keys that are discussed in introduction 
results by business segment the tables that follow summarize selected financial information by business segment  based upon a fixed leverage ratio across business units  the allocation of most corporate expenses and exclude tch results of operations in millions 
years ended three months december  ended year ended december  september  net income loss specialty finance commercial specialty finance consumer total specialty finance commercial finance equipment finance capital finance total commercial finance total segments corporate  including certain charges  total  return on aea specialty finance commercial specialty finance consumer total specialty finance commercial finance equipment finance capital finance total commercial finance total segments corporate  including certain charges total beginning in  management will be measuring segment performance using risk adjusted capital  applying different leverage ratios to each business using market and risk criteria 
our segment reporting was modified in two ways in first  in order to align better with the market place and improve efficiency  the former structured finance segment was merged with capital finance  and at the same time the telecommunications and media portfolio was moved to the business credit unit of commercial finance 
secondly  our specialty finance consumer unit was broken out as a separate segment 
all prior periods have been conformed to these changes and this updated presentation is consistent with the reporting to management during versus results results by segment were as follows o specialty finance commercial reflected profitability improvement in the small mid ticket leasing and the continuation of strong returns in the vendor programs  which were offset in part by the loss related to the accelerated liquidation of the manufactured housing portfolio 
o specialty finance consumer results reflected higher net income and the continuation of good returns in the home lending unit 
home lending profitability also reflected lower securitization gains in o commercial finance earnings benefited from continued high returns in both the factoring and asset based lending businesses 
the improvement from the prior year was particularly strong in the factoring unit  as current year results benefited from acquisitions completed in the latter part of o equipment finance returns  while still below management s expectations  improved from the low level  reflecting lower charge offs  improved funding costs and higher equipment gains 
profitability improvement was across business lines in both the us and canada 
o similar to equipment finance  capital finance returns rebounded from disappointing results in  reflecting some improvement in aerospace rentals and continued strong rail rentals  as well as increased non spread revenue 
versus results the improvement in the bottom line return on aea in versus was due to the goodwill impairment charge in and reduced corporate charges in segment returns for versus the periods were reduced by the allocation of all borrowing costs to the segments in noteworthy trends by segment are as follows o specialty finance return on aea  while below  was in line with the corporate return on equity targets for specialty finance performance for included improved earnings in international operations and strong earnings from vendor programs  offset by slightly higher charge offs and reduced securitization gains from levels 
o commercial finance earnings remained very strong  benefiting from continued high returns in both the factoring and asset based lending businesses 
o equipment finance returns reflected soft margins  offset in part by reduced charge offs in relation to o capital finance earnings were dampened by the lower aerospace rental rates and the waste to energy project charge off 
corporate included amounts as shown in the table below after tax years ended three months december  ended year ended december  september  unallocated expenses specific telecommunication argentine provisions gain on debt redemption venture capital operating losses  net goodwill impairment  total  venture capital operating net losses include realized and unrealized gains and losses related to venture capital investments as well as interest costs and other operating expenses associated with these portfolios 
the increase in unallocated corporate operating expense in was due primarily to increased performance based compensation  professional services and other compliance related costs as well as higher unallocated funding costs 
net finance margin an analysis of net finance margin is set forth below in millions years ended three months december  ended year ended december  september  finance income loans and capital leases    rental income on operating leases    interest expense    net finance income    depreciation on operating lease equipment   net finance margin    average earnings asset aea     as a of aea finance income loans and capital leases rental income on operating leases interest expense net finance income depreciation on operating lease equipment net finance margin as a of aol rental income on operating leases depreciation on operating lease equipment net operating lease margin average operating lease equipment aol     versus results o for the year ended december   net finance margin improved by million or basis points as a percentage of aea from  due primarily to reduced borrowing costs 
o finance income on loans and capital leases  while up in amount from  declined as a percentage of assets  as the portfolio continued to reprice in the relatively low rate environment 
o the trend in net finance margin as a percentage of aea  excluding the impact of operating lease rentals  reflects a greater decline in interest expense than in finance income yield  primarily due to the narrowing improvement of our credit spreads and the refinancing of higher cost debt 
the increase in aea reflects growth in the latter part of and in o operating lease rentals decreased by million or basis points as a percentage of average operating leases from the prior year period  reflecting a higher proportion of aerospace and rail assets in capital finance and the continued soft aerospace rentals though we have experienced some recent improvement 
these longer lived assets have lower rental rates as a percentage of the asset base than small to mid ticket leasing assets in specialty finance and equipment finance 
o depreciation expense declined similarly from  reflecting the asset mix change to longer lived from shorter term assets 
as a result operating lease margin as a percentage of operating lease assets was up modestly from the prior year 
see concentrations operating leases for additional information regarding our operating lease assets 
versus results o finance income for reflected the continued decline in market interest rates 
however  interest expense did not decline proportionally with the drop in market interest rates due to the use of bank lines drawn in for part of  term debt issued in at wider credit spreads and excess cash maintained for liquidity purposes 
therefore  net finance margin as percentage of aea decreased in from the prior periods 
o finance income as a percentage of aea declined in each period since this primarily reflected the drop in us treasury rates of approximately basis points from the first quarter of through the second quarter of reduced operating lease rentals also contributed to the decline 
o interest expense as a percentage of aea also declined since  as the favorable impact of lower market interest rates was partially offset by wider borrowing spreads and the resultant higher cost of funding transactions executed following the funding base disruption in at december   billion in outstanding commercial paper was fully supported by undrawn bank facilities 
at december  and september   commercial paper outstanding was billion and billion  respectively  while drawn commercial bank lines were billion and billion  respectively 
we regularly monitor and simulate our degree of interest rate sensitivity by measuring the repricing characteristics of interest sensitive assets  liabilities  and derivatives 
the capital committee reviews the results of this modeling periodically 
the interest rate sensitivity modeling techniques we employ include the creation of prospective twelve month baseline and rate shocked net interest income simulations 
at the date that interest rate sensitivity is modeled  baseline net interest income is derived considering the current level of interest sensitive assets  the current level of interest sensitive liabilities and related maturities  and the current level of derivatives 
the baseline simulation assumes that  over the next successive twelve months  market interest rates as of the date of simulation are held constant and that no new loans or leases are extended 
once the baseline net interest income is calculated  market interest rates  which were previously held constant  are raised instantaneously basis points across the entire yield curve  and a rate shocked simulation is run 
interest rate sensitivity is then measured as the difference between calculated baseline and rate shocked net interest income 
an immediate hypothetical basis point increase in the yield curve on january  would reduce net income by an estimated million after tax over the next twelve months 
a corresponding decrease in the yield curve would cause an increase in net income of a like amount 
a basis point increase in the yield curve on january  would have reduced net income by an estimated million after tax  while a corresponding decrease in the yield curve would have increased net income by a like amount 
although management believes that this measure provides an estimate of our interest rate sensitivity  it does not account for potential changes in the credit quality  size  composition and prepayment characteristics of the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net income 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the estimated outcomes of our simulations 
further  such simulations do not represent management s current view of future market interest rate movements 
a comparative analysis of the weighted average principal outstanding and interest rates on our debt before and after the effect of interest rate swaps is shown in the following table in millions

excluding the impact of the reduction to the specific telecommunications reserve in the fourth quarter of  the risk adjusted margin as a percentage of aea was for the year ended december  excluding the additional credit provisions in to establish reserves for the telecommunications and argentine exposures  risk adjusted margin as a percentage of aea was for the twelve months ended september  other revenue the components of other revenue are set forth in the following table in millions 
years ended three months december  ended year ended december  september  fees and other income factoring commissions gains on sales of leasing equipment gains on securitizations total other revenue other revenue as a percentage of aea we continue to emphasize growth and diversification of other revenues to improve our overall profitability 
o fees and other income include securitization related servicing fees and accretion  syndication fees  miscellaneous fees and gains from asset sales 
securitization related fees declined in other fees in were essentially flat with the prior year 
the drop in securitization related fees  which includes accretion related to our retained interest net of impairment charges and servicing fees  corresponds to the decline in securitized assets during the emphasis on funding home lending receivables on balance sheet results in a shift of securitization related revenues to both interest margin and provision for credit losses 
fees and other income were reduced by a million loss related to accelerated liquidation of the manufactured housing portfolio in the fourth quarter of o the trend of higher factoring commissions reflects strong volumes  benefiting from two large acquisitions completed during the latter part of o gains on sales of equipment improved sharply from prior periods as we saw some firming of equipment prices  and higher gains across virtually all leasing businesses 
the improvement was most notable in equipment finance and in the international unit of specialty finance commercial 
o securitization gains decreased in  due to both a lower volume of receivables securitized and reduced gains on amounts securitized 
the volume decline included a million drop in specialty finance commercial assets sold 
additionally  in  we continued to fund home lending growth entirely on balance sheet  versus million of home lending assets that were securitized in the lower gain as a percentage of volume in is primarily due to a higher proportion of  and tighter spreads on  vendor receivables sold 
securitization gains were of pretax income in  down from in we continue to target securitization gains at a maximum of of pretax income

reserve for credit losses finance receivables the reserve for credit losses is determined based on three key components specific reserves for collateral and cash flow dependent loans that are impaired under sfas  reserves for estimated losses inherent in the portfolio based upon historical and projected credit trends and reserves for economic environment and other factors 
the reserve included specific reserves  excluding telecommunication accounts  relating to impaired loans of million  million  and million at december   and the portion of the reserve related to inherent estimated loss and estimation risk reflects our evaluation of trends in our key credit metrics  as well as our assessment of risk in certain industry sectors  including commercial aerospace 
the consolidated reserve for credit losses is intended to provide for losses inherent in the portfolio  which requires the application of estimates and significant judgment as to the ultimate outcome of collection efforts and realization of collateral values  among other things 
therefore  changes in economic conditions or credit metrics  including past due and non performing accounts  or other events affecting specific obligors or industries may necessitate additions or reductions to the consolidated reserve for credit losses 
management continues to believe that the credit risk characteristics of the portfolio are well diversified by geography  industry  borrower and equipment type

based on currently available information  management believes that our total reserve for credit losses is adequate 
reserve for credit losses telecommunications in light of the improved performance of cit s competitive local exchange carriers clec portfolio and the telecommunications industry generally  as well as the continued reduction in outstanding receivables  the specific reserve related to the telecommunications portfolio was reduced by million during the quarter ended december   reflecting lower non performing loans  lower risk of loss remaining in the portfolio and improved market valuations 
the december quarter marked the first period since the establishment of the specific telecommunications reserve that there were no charge offs recorded against that reserve during a quarter 
cit originally added million to its reserve for credit losses during the quarter ended june  in light of deterioration in the telecommunications sector  particularly with respect to cit s clec portfolio 
in subsequent periods  cit recorded net charge offs of million against this specific reserve 
our telecommunications portfolio is included in communications in the industry composition table included in note concentrations to the consolidated financial statements 
this portfolio includes lending and leasing transactions to the telecommunications sector 
lending and leasing of telecommunication equipment to non telecom companies is conducted in our specialty finance business and is categorized according to the customer s obligor s industry in the industry composition table

with the completion of this transaction  we transferred the remaining specific reserve of million to the reserve for credit losses finance receivables 
in the first half of  we established a million specific reserve for argentine exposure to reflect the geopolitical risks associated with collecting our peso based assets and repatriating them into us dollars that resulted from the argentine government instituting certain economic reforms 
when established  the reserve was about two thirds of our combined currency and credit exposure 
during the fourth quarter of  based on the substantial progress with collection and work out efforts  we recorded a million charge off against this specific reserve and transferred million to the reserve for credit losses finance receivables

these improvements were in part offset by approximately million in charge offs taken with respect to customers of norvergence  inc  a bankrupt vendor 
o commercial finance charge offs were below the prior year reflecting the stronger economy 
while occurring in both the asset based lending and factoring businesses  the decline was particularly notable in business credit 
in conjunction with the combination of the former structured finance into capital finance  the communications and media portfolio was transferred to the commercial finance segment 
as a result  charge offs against the specific telecommunications reserve are reflected in this segment 
see discussion in reserve for credit losses regarding the specific reserve for telecommunications 
o equipment finance improvement continued throughout reduced charge offs across all product lines in both the us and canada reflected lower non performing assets and strengthening collateral values 
o capital finance charge offs for were primarily in the project finance portfolio 
o specialty finance consumer home lending charge offs  while up in amount  were down as a percentage of average finance receivables from the prior year  reflecting portfolio growth

charge offs in included amounts associated with several loan work outs due to the weaker economic trends  while amounts included significant charge offs in the telecommunication portfolio 
o equipment finance improvement was considerable in relation to due to reductions across all product lines in both the us and canada 
o the increased capital finance charge offs were primarily the result of an million charge off recorded to write down the value of a waste to energy project following bankruptcy proceedings and the renegotiation of the related contracts

improvement in the small business lending portfolio was offset by an increase in the vendor programs 
o commercial finance past due levels were down modestly from due to improvement in the business credit asset based lending unit and in the telecommunications portfolio 
an increase in factoring delinquency primarily one large credit offset these declines 
o equipment finance delinquency reflected continued improvement across virtually all product lines in relation to o capital finance improvement from included lower delinquency in the project finance portfolio  though delinquency was up in the regional aerospace portfolio 
o specialty finance consumer home lending delinquency was up in dollar amount but down as a percentage of finance receivables from  reflecting a return to on balance sheet funding of the home lending portfolio 
delinquency on a managed basis has been relatively stable in percentage terms over the periods presented 
similarly  the rate of improvement in non performing assets slowed in  reflecting the same trends discussed above 
the more dramatic improvement in capital finance non performing assets reflected the work out of a significant project finance account 
non performing telecommunications accounts in commercial finance totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
trends the december  delinquency rate of marked the fifth consecutive quarter of improvement and was the lowest level since december past due loans were down across virtually all segments with the greatest improvement in equipment finance 
the fluctuations in equipment finance and specialty finance commercial also reflect the transfer in march of small business loans and leases from equipment finance to specialty finance commercial 
past due accounts related to these transferred portfolios approximated million  million and million at december   december  and september   respectively 
prior periods have not been restated to reflect this transfer 
o absent the transfer  specialty finance commercial delinquency improved  reflecting the continued decline in past dues in international portfolios  including european operations where servicing was centralized during o the commercial finance decline from both periods was due to improvements in both the commercial services factoring and business credit asset based lending units 
o capital finance delinquency improved million during  due to the return to earning status of a waste to energy project and lower delinquency in the aerospace portfolio 
o though up in amount from  specialty finance consumer home lending delinquency as a percentage of finance receivables improved  reflecting a return to on balance sheet growth in this portfolio during this is in contrast to when higher quality consumer assets were securitized to meet funding requirements 
as shown in the table below  consumer delinquency on a managed basis has been relatively stable in percentage over the periods presented 
non performing assets also declined and reached the lowest level since  reflecting the same trends discussed above  namely considerable improvement in the equipment finance and capital finance segments 
in addition to the above mentioned waste to energy project  the capital finance reduction from december  also reflected the conversion of united airlines receivables million to short term operating leases following the carrier s december chapter bankruptcy filing

salaries and general operating expenses the efficiency ratio and the ratio of salaries and general operating expenses to average managed assets ama are summarized in the following table in millions 
years ended three months december  ended year ended december  september  salaries and employee benefits other general operating expenses salaries and general operating expenses  efficiency ratio salaries and general operating expenses as a percentage of ama average managed assets     efficiency ratio is the ratio of salaries and general operating expenses to operating margin  excluding the provision for credit losses 
ama means average managed assets  which is average earning assets plus the average of finance receivables previously securitized and still managed by cit 
the september  data excludes expenses relating to tch  a tyco acquisition company that had temporary status with respect to tyco s acquisition of cit 
salaries and general operating expenses for the year ended december  increased from primarily due to the following higher incentive based compensation including restricted stock awards  increase in professional fees  including higher compliance related costs related to the sarbanes oxley act  increased benefit expense  increased maintenance expenses related to operating lease equipment and higher marketing expenses 
salaries and general operating expenses for the year ended december  increased from the prior periods primarily due to incentive based compensation and other employee benefit expenses  as well as from expenses associated with our return to public ownership 
personnel totaled approximately  at december  compared to  at december    at december   and  at september  the increase during was primarily due to the european vendor finance business acquisition 
the efficiency ratio deteriorated for the year ended december  compared to  as the rate of expense increase outpaced revenue growth 
efficiency ratio improvements in both specialty finance segments in were offset by a modest increase in the other segments and higher corporate expense 
the deterioration in the efficiency ratio for the year ended december  and three months ended december  compared to september  is principally the result of lower revenues in the respective periods 
similarly  the deterioration in the ratio of salaries and general operating expenses to ama from the september  fiscal year reflects reduced levels of average managed assets 
business unit and corporate management monitor expenses closely  and actual results are reviewed monthly in comparison to business plan and forecast 
an approval and review procedure is in place for major capital expenditures  such as computer equipment and software  including post implementation evaluations 
improvement in the efficiency ratio is one of management s primary goals for and several initiatives are underway to reduce costs  including system consolidations and process efficiency improvements 
we have the capacity to grow assets without commensurate expense increases  and we expect compliance related expenses to decline from additionally  we remain focused on growing non spread revenue 
gain on redemption of debt in january and december  we called at par billion of long term debt securities 
these notes were listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbols cic and cip and were commonly known as pines public income notes 
the securities carried coupon rates of and  but were marked down to a market interest rate yield of approximately in our financial statements through purchase accounting 
in light of the high coupon rates  we called the securities for redemption pursuant to the terms outlined in the prospectuses 
the call of million of notes on january  resulted in a pretax gain of million million after tax in the first quarter of the december call of million of notes resulted in a pretax gain of million million after tax during the fourth quarter of income taxes the following table sets forth the certain information concerning our income taxes in millions years ended three months december  ended year ended december  september  provision for income taxes effective tax rate effective tax rate excluding goodwill impairment and tch results the effective tax rate exceeds the us federal tax rate of primarily due to state and local  and foreign income taxes 
at december   cit had us federal net operating losses of approximately billion  which expire in various years beginning in in addition  cit has various state net operating losses that will expire in various years beginning in federal and state operating losses may be subject to annual use limitations under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and other limitations under certain state laws 
management believes that cit will have sufficient taxable income in future years and can avail itself of tax planning strategies in order to utilize these federal losses fully 
accordingly  we do not believe a valuation allowance is required with respect to these federal net operating losses 
as of december   based on management s assessment as to realizability  the net deferred tax liability includes a valuation allowance of approximately million relating to state net operating losses 
cit has open tax years in the us  canada and other jurisdictions that are currently under examination by the applicable taxing authorities  and certain tax years that may in the future be subject to examination 
management periodically evaluates the adequacy of our related tax reserves  taking into account our open tax return positions  tax assessments received  tax law changes and third party indemnifications 
we believe that our tax reserves are appropriate 
the final determination of tax audits could affect our tax reserves 
we are currently evaluating certain provisions included in the american jobs creation act of that could result in an increase in our business activity in certain foreign jurisdictions 
these provisions  if implemented  could result in a reduction in our future effective tax rate

management strives to maximize the profitability of the lease equipment portfolio by balancing equipment utilization levels with market rental rates and lease terms 
equipment not subject to lease agreements totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the reduction was due to fewer commercial aerospace and rail assets off lease as well as the sale of a test equipment rental business 
the higher december  off lease equipment balance primarily reflects the higher level of commercial aircraft and rail assets off lease in capital finance at that time 
weakness in the commercial airline industry could adversely impact prospective rental and utilization rates 
leveraged leases the major components of net investments in leveraged leases include commercial aerospace transactions  including tax optimized leveraged leases  which generally have increased risk of loss in default for lessors in relation to conventional lease structures due to additional leverage and the third party lender priority recourse to the equipment in these transactions  project finance transactions  primarily in the power and utility sectors  and rail transactions

our aerospace assets include both operating leases and capital leases 
management monitors economic conditions affecting equipment values  trends in equipment values  and periodically obtains third party appraisals of commercial aerospace equipment  which include projected rental rates 
we adjust the depreciation schedules of commercial aerospace equipment on operating leases or residual values underlying capital leases when required 
aerospace assets are reviewed for impairment annually  or more often when events or circumstances warrant 
an aerospace asset is defined as impaired when the expected undiscounted cash flow over its expected remaining life is less than its book value 
both historical information and current economic trends are factored into the assumptions and analyses used when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow 
included among these assumptions are the following o lease terms o remaining life of the asset o lease rates supplied by independent appraisers o remarketing prospects o maintenance costs an impairment loss is recognized if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
aerospace depreciation expense for the year ended december  totaled million and included a million impairment charge taken in the second quarter to reduce certain older  out of production aircraft to estimated fair value 
the additional depreciation expense primarily related to aircraft with a single lessee with upcoming lease terminations and for which market rental rates have recently declined 
therefore  the projected cash flows no longer supported the corresponding carrying value  resulting in the additional depreciation charge 
commercial airline equipment utilization is high  with only two aircraft off lease with a book value of million at december   which demonstrates our ability to place aircraft 
despite some recent improvement in rental rates  current placements remain at compressed rental rates  which reflects current market conditions 
generally  leases are being written for terms between three and five years 
within the regional aircraft portfolio at december   there were aircraft off lease with a total book value of approximately million

risk management our business activities involve various elements of risk 
we consider the principal types of risk to be credit risk including credit  collateral and equipment risk and market risk including interest rate  foreign currency and liquidity risk 
managing risks is essential to conducting our commercial and consumer businesses and to our profitability 
accordingly  our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze key business risks  to set appropriate policies and limits  and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems  along with other policies and programs 
during  we further elevated the prominence of risk management throughout the organization with the establishment of the position of vice chairman chief risk officer within the office of the chairman 
we review and monitor credit exposures  both owned and managed  on an ongoing basis to identify  as early as possible  customers that may be experiencing declining creditworthiness or financial difficulty  and periodically evaluate the performance of our finance receivables across the entire organization 
we monitor concentrations by borrower  industry  geographic region and equipment type  and we set or modify exposure limits as conditions warrant  to minimize credit concentrations and the risk of substantial credit loss 
we have maintained a standard practice of reviewing our aerospace portfolio regularly and  in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 we test for asset impairment based upon projected cash flows and relevant market data with any impairment in value charged to earnings 
given the developments in the aerospace sector during and  performance  profitability and residual values relating to aerospace assets have been reviewed more frequently with the executive credit committee 
in conjunction with our capital allocation initiatives  we are in the process of enhancing our credit risk management practices  including portfolio modeling  probability of default analysis  further development of risk based pricing tools  and reserve for credit loss analysis 
our asset quality review committee is comprised of members of senior management  including the vice chairman chief risk officer  the vice chairman chief financial officer  the chief credit officer  the controller and the director of credit audit 
periodically  this committee meets with senior executives of our business units and corporate credit risk management group to review portfolio performance  including the status of individual financing and leasing assets  owned and managed  to obligors with higher risk profiles 
in addition  this committee periodically meets with the chief executive officer of cit to review overall credit risk  including geographic  industry and customer concentrations  and the reserve for credit losses 
credit risk management we have developed systems specifically designed to manage credit risk in each of our business segments 
we evaluate financing and leasing assets for credit and collateral risk during the credit granting process and periodically after the advancement of funds 
the corporate credit risk management group  which reports to the vice chairman and chief risk officer  oversees and manages credit risk throughout cit 
this group includes senior credit executives in each of the business units 
our executive credit committee includes the chief executive officer  the chief risk officer and members of the corporate credit risk management group 
the committee approves transactions which are outside of established target market definitions and risk acceptance criteria  corporate exceptions as delineated within the individual business unit credit authority and transactions that exceed the strategic business units credit authority 
the corporate credit risk management group also includes an independent credit audit function 
each of our strategic business units has developed and implemented a formal credit management process in accordance with formal uniform guidelines established by the credit risk management group 
these guidelines set forth risk acceptance criteria for o acceptable maximum credit lines  o selected target markets and products  o creditworthiness of borrowers  including credit history  financial condition  adequacy of cash flow  financial performance and quality of management  and o the type and value of underlying collateral and guarantees including recourse from dealers and manufacturers 
compliance with established corporate policies and procedures  along with the credit management processes at each strategic business unit are reviewed by the credit audit group 
the credit audit group examines adherence with established credit policies and procedures and tests for inappropriate credit practices  including whether potential problem accounts are being detected and reported on a timely basis 
commercial credit risk management the commercial credit management process other than small ticket leasing transactions begins with the initial evaluation of credit risk and underlying collateral at the time of origination and continues over the life of the finance receivable or operating lease  including collecting past due balances and liquidating underlying collateral 
credit personnel review a potential borrower s financial condition  results of operations  management  industry  customer base  operations  collateral and other data  such as third party credit reports  to thoroughly evaluate the customer s borrowing and repayment ability 
borrowers are graded according to credit quality based upon our uniform credit grading system  which considers both the borrower s financial condition and the underlying collateral 
credit facilities are subject to approval within our overall credit approval and underwriting guidelines and are issued commensurate with the credit evaluation performed on each borrower 
consumer and small ticket leasing lending for consumer transactions and small ticket leasing lending transactions  we employ proprietary automated credit scoring models by loan type that include customer demographics and credit bureau characteristics 
the profiles emphasize  among other things  occupancy status  length of residence  employment  debt to income ratio ratio of total installment debt and housing expenses to gross monthly income  bank account references  credit bureau information  combined loan to value ratio  length of time in business  industry category and geographic location 
the models are used to assess a potential borrower s credit standing and repayment ability considering the value or adequacy of property offered as collateral 
our credit criteria include reliance on credit scores  including those based upon both our proprietary internal credit scoring model and external credit bureau scoring  combined with judgment 
the credit scoring models are regularly reviewed for effectiveness utilizing statistical tools 
we regularly evaluate the consumer loan portfolio and the small ticket leasing portfolio using past due  vintage curve and other statistical tools to analyze trends and credit performance by loan type  including analysis of specific credit characteristics and other selected subsets of the portfolios 
adjustments to credit scorecards and lending programs are made when deemed appropriate 
individual underwriters are assigned credit authority based upon their experience  performance and understanding of the underwriting policies and procedures of our consumer and small ticket leasing operations 
a credit approval hierarchy also exists to ensure that an underwriter with the appropriate level of authority reviews all applications 
equipment residual risk management we have developed systems  processes and expertise to manage the equipment and residual risk in our commercial segments 
our process consists of the following setting residual value at transaction inception  systematic residual reviews  and monitoring of residual realizations 
reviews for impairment are performed at least annually 
residual realizations  by business unit and product  are reviewed as part of our ongoing financial and asset quality review  both within the business units and by senior management 
market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in values of financial instruments  and includes interest rate risk  foreign exchange risk  derivative counterparty credit risk and liquidity risk 
we engage in transactions in the normal course of business that expose us to market risks 
we conduct what we believe are appropriate management practices and maintain policies designed to effectively mitigate such risks 
the objectives of our market risk management efforts are to preserve the economic and accounting returns of our assets by matching the repricing and maturity characteristics of our assets with that of our liabilities 
strategies for managing market risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates are an integral part of the process  because those strategies affect our future expected cash flows as well as our cost of capital 
our capital committee sets policies  oversees and guides the interest rate and currency risk management process  including the establishment and monitoring of risk metrics  and ensures the implementation of those policies 
other risks monitored by the capital committee include derivative counterparty credit risk and liquidity risk 
the capital committee meets periodically and includes the chief executive officer  vice chairman and chief financial officer  vice chairman and chief risk officer  vice chairman specialty finance  vice chairman commercial finance  treasurer  and controller  with business unit executives serving on a rotating basis 
interest rate and foreign exchange risk management interest rate risk management we monitor our interest rate sensitivity on a regular basis by analyzing the impact of interest rate changes upon the financial performance of the business 
we also consider factors such as the strength of the economy  customer prepayment behavior and re pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
we evaluate and monitor various risk metrics o margin at risk mar  which measures the impact of changing interest rates upon interest income over the subsequent twelve months 
see net finance margin section for discussion and results of this simulation 
o value at risk var  which measures the net economic value of assets by assessing the duration of assets and liabilities 
we offer a variety of financing products to our customers  including fixed and floating rate loans of various maturities and currency denominations  and a variety of leases  including operating leases 
changes in market interest rates  relationships between short term and long term market interest rates  or relationships between different interest rate indices ie  basis risk can affect the interest rates charged on interest earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and can result in an increase in interest expense relative to finance income 
we measure our asset liability position in economic terms through duration measures and sensitivity analysis  and we measure the effect on earnings using maturity gap analysis 
our asset portfolio is generally comprised of loans and leases of short to intermediate term 
as such  the duration of our asset portfolio is generally less than three years 
we target to closely match the duration of our liability portfolio with that of our asset portfolio 
as of december   our liability portfolio duration was slightly longer than our asset portfolio duration 
a matched asset liability position is generally achieved through a combination of financial instruments  including commercial paper  medium term notes  long term debt  interest rate and currency swaps  foreign exchange contracts  and through securitization 
we do not speculate on interest rates or foreign exchange rates  but rather seek to mitigate the possible impact of such rate fluctuations encountered in the normal course of business 
this process is ongoing due to prepayments  refinancings and actual payments varying from contractual terms  as well as other portfolio dynamics 
we periodically enter into structured financings involving the issuance of both debt and an interest rate swap with corresponding notional principal amount and maturity to manage liquidity and reduce interest rate risk at a lower overall funding cost than could be achieved by solely issuing debt 
as part of managing exposure to interest rate  foreign currency  and  in limited instances  credit risk  cit  as an end user  enters into various derivative transactions  all of which are transacted in over the counter markets with other financial institutions acting as principal counterparties 
derivatives are utilized for economic hedging purposes only  and our policy prohibits entering into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
to ensure both appropriate use as a hedge and to achieve hedge accounting treatment  whenever possible  substantially all derivatives entered into are designated according to a hedge objective against a specific or forecasted liability or  in limited instances  assets 
the notional amounts  rates  indices  and maturities of our derivatives closely match the related terms of the underlying hedged items 
cit utilizes interest rate swaps to exchange variable rate interest underlying forecasted issuances of commercial paper  specific variable rate debt instruments  and  in limited instances  variable rate assets for fixed rate amounts 
these interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and changes in fair value of these swaps  to the extent they are effective as a hedge  are recorded in other comprehensive income 
ineffective amounts are recorded in interest expense 
interest rate swaps are also utilized to convert fixed rate interest on specific debt instruments to variable rate amounts 
these interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges and changes in fair value of these swaps are effectively recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item  as the offsetting changes in fair value of the swaps and the hedged items are recorded in earnings 
the following table summarizes the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities before and after swaps before swaps after swaps fixed rate floating rate fixed rate floating rate december  assets liabilities december  assets liabilities total interest sensitive assets were billion and billion at december  and total interest sensitive liabilities were billion and billion at december  and foreign exchange risk management to the extent local foreign currency borrowings are not raised  cit utilizes foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge or mitigate currency risk underlying foreign currency loans to subsidiaries and the net investments in foreign operations 
these contracts are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges or net investment hedges and changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded in other comprehensive income along with the translation gains and losses on the underlying hedged items 
translation gains and losses of the underlying foreign net investment  as well as offsetting derivative gains and losses on designated hedges  are reflected in other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet 
cit also utilizes cross currency swaps to hedge currency risk underlying foreign currency debt and selected foreign currency assets 
these swaps are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges or foreign currency fair value hedges and changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded in other comprehensive income for cash flow hedges  or effectively as a basis adjustment including the impact of the offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item to the hedged item for fair value hedges along with the transaction gains and losses on the underlying hedged items 
other market risk management cit also utilizes treasury locks bond forwards to hedge interest rate risk associated with planned debt issuances and asset sales 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges of a forecasted transaction  with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded in other comprehensive income 
gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted transaction impacts earnings 
during  cit entered into credit default swaps to economically hedge certain cit credit exposures 
these swaps do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment and therefore are recorded at fair value  with both realized and unrealized gains or losses recorded in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income 
see note derivative financial instruments for further discussion  including notional principal balances of interest rate swaps  foreign currency exchange forward contracts  cross currency swaps  treasury locks  and credit default swaps 
derivative risk management we enter into interest rate and currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts as part of our overall market risk management practices 
we assess and manage the external and internal risks associated with these derivative instruments in accordance with the overall operating goals established by our capital committee 
external risk is defined as those risks outside of our direct control  including counterparty credit risk  liquidity risk  systemic risk  legal risk and market risk 
internal risk relates to those operational risks within the management oversight structure and includes actions taken in contravention of cit policy 
the primary external risk of derivative instruments is counterparty credit exposure  which is defined as the ability of a counterparty to perform its financial obligations under a derivative contract 
we control the credit risk of our derivative agreements through counterparty credit approvals  pre established exposure limits and monitoring procedures 
the capital committee  in conjunction with corporate risk management  approves each counterparty and establishes exposure limits based on credit analysis and market value 
all derivative agreements are entered into with major money center financial institutions rated investment grade by nationally recognized rating agencies  with the majority of our counterparties rated aa or better 
credit exposures are measured based on the current market value and potential future exposure of outstanding derivative instruments 
exposures are calculated for each derivative contract and are aggregated by counterparty to monitor credit exposure 
liquidity risk management liquidity risk refers to the risk of being unable to meet potential cash outflows promptly and cost effectively 
factors that could cause such a risk to arise might be a disruption of a securities market or other source of funds 
we actively manage and mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining diversified sources of funding and committed alternate sources of funding  and we maintain and periodically review a contingency funding plan to be implemented in the event of any form of market disruption 
additionally  we target our debt issuance strategy to achieve a maturity pattern designed to reduce refinancing risk 
the primary funding sources are commercial paper us  canada and australia  long term debt us and international and asset backed securities us and canada 
outstanding commercial paper totaled billion at december   compared with billion at december   and billion at december  our targeted us program size remains at billion with modest programs aggregating million to be maintained in canada and australia 
our goal is to maintain committed bank lines in excess of aggregate outstanding commercial paper 
we have aggregate bank facilities of billion with billion in multi year facilities 
we maintain registration statements with the securities and exchange commission sec covering debt securities that we may sell in the future 
at december   we had billion of registered  but unissued  debt securities available under which we may issue debt securities and other capital market securities 
term debt issued during totaled billion billion in variable rate medium term notes and billion in fixed rate notes 
consistent with our strategy of managing debt refinancing risk  the weighted average maturity of term debt issued in was approximately five years 
included with the fixed rate notes are issuances under a retail note program in which we offer fixed rate senior  unsecured notes utilizing numerous broker dealers for placement to retail accounts 
during the year  we issued billion under this program having maturities of between and years 
as part of our strategy to further diversify our funding sources  billion of foreign currency denominated debt was issued during we plan on continuing to utilize diversified sources of debt funding to meet our strategic global growth initiatives 
to further strengthen our funding capabilities  we maintain committed asset backed facilities and shelf registration statements  which cover a range of assets from equipment to consumer home lending receivables and trade accounts receivable 
while these are predominately in the us  we also maintain facilities for canadian domiciled assets 
as of december   we had approximately billion of availability in our committed asset backed facilities and billion of registered  but unissued  securities available under public shelf registration statements relating to our asset backed securitization program 
our committed asset backed commercial paper programs in the us and canada provide a substantial source of alternate liquidity 
we also maintain committed bank lines of credit to provide backstop support of commercial paper borrowings and local bank lines to support our international operations 
additional sources of liquidity are loan and lease payments from customers  whole loan asset sales and loan syndications 
we also target and monitor certain liquidity metrics to ensure both a balanced liability profile and adequate alternate liquidity availability as outlined in the following table 
december  december  december  liquidity measurement current target commercial paper to total debt maximum of short term debt to total debt maximum of bank lines to commercial paper minimum of aggregate alternate liquidity to short term debt minimum of aggregate alternative liquidity includes available bank facilities  asset backed conduit facilities and cash 
our credit ratings are an important factor in meeting our earnings and margin targets as better ratings generally correlate to lower cost of funds see net finance margin  interest expense discussion 
the following credit ratings have been in place since september  short term long term outlook moody s p a stable standard poor s a a stable fitch f a stable the credit ratings stated above are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
we have certain covenants contained in our legal documents that govern our funding sources 
the most significant covenant in cit s indentures and credit agreements is a negative pledge provision  which limits granting or permitting liens on our assets  but provides for exceptions for certain ordinary course liens needed to operate our business 
in addition  our credit agreements also contain a minimum net worth requirement of billion

off balance sheet arrangements securitization program we fund asset originations on our balance sheet by accessing various sectors of the capital markets  including the term debt and commercial paper markets 
in an effort to broaden funding sources and provide an additional source of liquidity  we use an array of securitization programs  including both asset backed commercial paper and term structures  to access both the public and private asset backed securitization markets 
current products in these programs include receivables and leases secured by equipment as well as consumer loans secured by residential real estate 
the following table summarizes data relating to our securitization balance and activity in millions

though we were well below this level in  at  management targets a maximum of of pre tax income from securitization gains 
under our typical asset backed securitization  we sell a pool of secured loans or leases to a special purpose entity spe  typically a trust 
spes are used to achieve true sale requirements for these transactions in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the special purpose entity  in turn  issues certificates and or notes that are collateralized by the pool and entitle the holders thereof to participate in certain pool cash flows 
accordingly  cit has no legal obligations to repay the securities in the event of a default by the spe 
cit retains the servicing rights of the securitized contracts  for which we earn a servicing fee 
we also participate in certain residual cash flows cash flows after payment of principal and interest to certificate and or note holders  servicing fees and other credit related disbursements 
at the date of securitization  we estimate the residual cash flows to be received over the life of the securitization  record the present value of these cash flows as a retained interest in the securitization retained interests can include bonds issued by the special purpose entity  cash reserve accounts on deposit in the special purpose entity or interest only receivables and typically recognize a gain 
assets securitized are shown in our managed assets and our capitalization ratios on a managed basis 
during  we successfully completed a consent solicitation to amend the negative pledge provision in our debt indenture 
this action conforms the debt indenture to our other agreements and provides flexibility in structuring our securitizations as accounting sales or secured financings 
in estimating residual cash flows and the value of the retained interests  we make a variety of financial assumptions  including pool credit losses  prepayment speeds and discount rates 
these assumptions are supported by both our historical experience and anticipated trends relative to the particular products securitized 
subsequent to recording the retained interests  we review them quarterly for impairment based on estimated fair value 
these reviews are performed on a disaggregated basis 
fair values of retained interests are estimated utilizing current pool demographics  actual note certificate outstandings  current and anticipated credit losses  prepayment speeds and discount rates 
our retained interests had a carrying value at december  of  million  including interests in commercial securitized assets of  million and consumer securitized assets of million 
the total retained interest as of december  is comprised of million in over collateralization  million of interest only strips  and million of cash reserve accounts 
retained interests are subject to credit and prepayment risk 
as of december   approximately of our outstanding securitization pool balances are in conduit structures 
these assets are subject to the same credit granting and monitoring processes which are described in the credit risk management section 
joint venture activities we utilize joint ventures organized through distinct legal entities to conduct financing activities with certain strategic vendor partners 
receivables are originated by the joint venture and purchased by cit 
the vendor partner and cit jointly own these distinct legal entities  and there is no third party debt involved 
these arrangements are accounted for using the equity method  with profits and losses distributed according to the joint venture agreement
