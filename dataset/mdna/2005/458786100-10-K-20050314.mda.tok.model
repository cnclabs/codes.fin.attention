on september   the company terminated and replaced its previously existing million revolving credit facility the old revolving facility and replaced it with the million  three year new revolving facility 
net of outstanding letters of credit and limitations on minimum availability  the company had borrowing capacity at december   of million under the new revolving facility and million million under the uk facility 
the company made no borrowings under the new revolving facility  the uk facility or the old revolving facility during  and as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under either the new revolving facility or the uk facility 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the financial covenants of each of these agreements 
the key terms of the new revolving facility are as follows the company s obligations under the new revolving facility are secured by substantially all the us assets of the company and its us subsidiaries and a pledge of of the stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries 
borrowings under the new revolving facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to at the company s option i libor plus an applicable margin ranging from to based on consolidated leverage  or ii the greater of the federal funds rate plus or the bank s prime rate  plus an applicable margin ranging from to based on consolidated leverage

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued management believes that cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with projected cash flow from operations and the sale of certain assets will provide adequate funding to meet its expected working capital  capital expenditure and restructuring cost requirements for the next twelve months 
projected cash flows from operations are largely based on the company s revenue estimates  cost estimates  and the related timing of cash receipts and cash disbursements 
if actual performance differs from estimated performance  cash flow from operations could be positively or negatively impacted 
additional sources of liquidity for the company include the revolving facility and the uk facility 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual commitments for continuing operations as of december  millions of dollars 
the table does not include amounts recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities 
long term debt and operating leases are discussed in the indicated notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt note b interest on long term debt purchase commitments operating leases note d total contractual obligations purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
the company is not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the company s purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons 
within the ias business  classified as discontinued operations  the majority of purchase orders are related to specific customer contracts 
as of december   the ias business had a backlog for signed customer contract orders totaling million 
there were no unconditional purchase obligations other than those related to inventory  services  tooling and property  plant and equipment purchased in the ordinary course of business 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  the company had aggregate off balance sheet letter of credit reimbursement agreements of million that relate to the company s performance on operating contracts with customers and generally expire within one year 
management does not believe that these letter of credit reimbursement agreements have a material effect on the company s financial condition  changes in the financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inflation in the opinion of management  inflation has not been a significant factor in the markets in which the company operates in  or and has not had a significant impact upon the results of its operations during these fiscal years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
significant estimates and assumptions were used to determine the provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable  excess and obsolete inventory  tax valuation allowances  recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  warranty costs  percentage of completion on long term contracts  retiree medical and pension obligations  estimated proceeds on businesses to be divested  estimated net realizable value of assets held for sale and litigation loss contingencies 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial position 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
changes in the financial condition of the company s customers could result in upward or downward adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory obsolescence 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolete or unsalable inventory based on assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than management s assumptions  additional inventory write downs could be required 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions could positively impact future operating results if previously written off inventory is sold 
income taxes 
the company considers future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the company operates and prudent  feasible and permissable tax planning strategies in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets 
if the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize a portion of its net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if the company were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for which there is currently a valuation allowance would be realized  the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company conducts business in various countries throughout the world and is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions 
as a result of its business activities  the company files a significant number of tax returns that are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
tax audits are often complex and may require several years to resolve 
the company records estimated tax liabilities to the extent the contingencies are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
such estimated tax liabilities are based on management s judgment and best estimate as to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
however  the company s future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the company s estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
as a result  the company s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
the company s effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because the company intends to reinvest such earnings permanently outside the united states 
as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements  the company s fiscal year results do not reflect the impact of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act 
the company has not fully evaluated the effects of the new repatriation provision contained in the jobs act 
material changes in the company s plan to reinvest certain undistributed foreign earnings permanently outside the u 
s could impact the company s future effective tax rate 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight line basis over the periods benefited 
all of the company s intangible assets pertain to the patent portfolio of the ads segment and have estimated useful lives of years 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually during the company s fourth fiscal quarter or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
the company establishes the fair value of reporting unit goodwill based on a discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flow is based on the company s strategic plans and long range planning forecasts  which include revenue and profit margin assumptions  based on management s best estimate 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its businesses are estimated 
however  actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
see note h to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if undiscounted expected cash flows to be generated by a long lived asset or asset group are less than its carrying amount  the company records an impairment to write down the long lived asset or asset group to its estimated fair value 
fair value is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued discontinued operations 
the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective january  this standard establishes accounting and reporting requirements for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for those businesses where management has committed to a plan to divest  each business is valued at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell 
if the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value  a loss is recognized 
the fair values are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a discounted cash flows model  earnings multiples  or indicative bids  when available 
a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques  including the forecasting of markets and market share  sales volumes and prices  costs and expenses  and multiple other factors 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made  however  the fair values that are ultimately realized upon the sale of the businesses to be divested may differ from the estimated fair values reflected in the financial statements 
businesses to be divested are classified in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
for businesses classified as discontinued operations  the balance sheet amounts and income statement results and cash flows are reclassified from their historical presentation to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets  to loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations  and to cash flows from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented 
additionally  segment information does not include the results of businesses classified as discontinued operations 
management does not expect any continuing involvement with these businesses following their planned sales  and these businesses are expected to be disposed of within one year 
pension benefits and other postretirement benefits 
the company has retirement and pension plans which cover most of its employees 
most of the company s us employees as well as the employees of certain us subsidiaries are covered by contributory defined benefit plans  under which employees may contribute up to of covered compensation annually 
annual employer contributions are made to the extent such contributions are actuarially determined to adequately fund the plans 
retiree benefits are based on the amount of participant contributions over the term of the participant s employment 
assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company s pension plans and other postretirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with an external actuary 
changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data  such as the rate of increase in compensation levels and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost projections are evaluated and updated annually 
note k to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates for the company s domestic and foreign plans 
the company believes the assumptions are appropriate 
however  these assumptions could vary materially from actual results due to economic events or different rates of retirement  mortality or withdrawal  positively or negatively impacting future results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the discount rate  used to discount future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date  reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments 
the discount rates for domestic and foreign plans as of december  were and  respectively  compared to and as of december  the decline in the discount rate used for foreign plans reflects lower interest rates in the current market 
the effect of one half percentage point decrease in the company s discount rate on pension cost would be an increase of million 
to determine the expected long term rate of return  the company uses historic market trends combined with current market conditions 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on its domestic and foreign plans was and respectively 
the effect on the company s pension cost of a one half percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would be an increase of million 
the company determines the expected rate of compensation increase based on historic trends and comparisons to external rates 
for domestic plans the company concluded that no adjustment to the expected rate of compensation increase was necessary and continued to use 
the company increased the rate used for foreign plans to annually for compared to annually for actuarial assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for other postretirement benefits include a discount rate of   and at december   and  respectively 
the effect on the company s postretirement benefit cost of one half percentage point decrease in the discount rate would be immaterial 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for fiscal year was and is projected to decrease over years to  where it is expected to remain thereafter 
the effect of a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost is not material 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the postretirement benefit obligation would result in an increase of approximately million  while a one percentage point decrease would result in a decrease of million 
revenue recognition 
revenues are generally recognized when products are shipped or services are rendered  the title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue is recorded when the revenue is earned  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
service and maintenance revenue is recognized as services are rendered  generally over the contract term  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  the entire revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
fair value for each element is established based on the sales price charged when the same element is sold separately 
the company reduces revenue for estimated customer returns  price protection  rebates and other offerings that occur under sales programs established by the company directly or with the company s distributors and resellers 
the company accrues the estimated cost of post sale obligations  including basic product warranties  based on historical experience at the time the company recognizes revenue 
long term contracts  principally within the ias business  classified as discontinued operations  are accounted for under the percentage of completion  cost to cost method of accounting  which requires the company to estimate total expected contract revenues and costs and record revenues and profits over the term of the contract 
estimated contract revenues and costs are based on contract specifications  expected requirements  and achievement of contract milestones  including deliveries 
the cumulative impact of changes in expected contract revenues and costs and any anticipated losses are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued contingencies 
the company assesses its exposure to loss contingencies  including environmental  legal and income tax matters  and provides for an exposure if it is judged to be probable and estimable 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from management s estimates  results of operations are adjusted upward or downward

rather  the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of original sfas on stock compensation awards rather than applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of opinion are disclosed in note k to the company s consolidated financial statements 
although such pro forma effects of applying original sfas may be indicative of the effects of adopting sfas r  the provisions of these two statements differ in some important respects 
the actual effects of adopting sfas r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model chosen by the company to value stock based awards  the assumed award forfeiture rate  the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition method chosen for adopting sfas r
