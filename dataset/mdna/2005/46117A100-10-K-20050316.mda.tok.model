item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background we provide infrastructure  systems and services  as well as innovative solutions for telecommunications providers and public safety organizations 
our core business is the support of the nation s emergency response infrastructure for wireline  wireless and voip networks 
the data we manage enables a call to be routed to the appropriate psap 
we provide callback data and the caller s location 
this critical information helps public safety organizations respond to calls for assistance 
in addition  this data allows the telecommunications carriers to meet state and federal regulatory mandates 
since we launched our data management services in  our data integrity infrastructure has provided virtually uninterrupted service to our telecommunications and public safety customers 
our customers include ilecs  clecs  wireless carriers  ixcs and a wide variety of state  local and federal government agencies 
segments effective january   we realigned our internal operating units by aggregating similar offerings with organizational supervision and decision making authorities 
as a result  we have historically identified and reported on three business units wireline  wireless and new markets 
beginning in  revenue and direct costs have been classified in the consolidated statements of operations by these three business units 
the change has not impacted our revenue recognition policies 
as a result of this change  revenue and direct costs for the year ended december  have been reclassified to conform to our current year presentation 
this change had no effect on our financial position  total revenue  total direct costs  net income loss or cash flows for any of the periods presented 
management further re aligned certain operating units in and will be reporting only two segments beginning in  wireline and wireless 
the following table identifies the business unit alignments and the respective years in which results of operations have been and will be reported going forward will include the following components included the following components wireline ilec  clec  texas  intellicast  voip and cdb products ilec  clec  texas  palladium and voip wireless wireless and bmd wireless and bmd wireless ag new markets no longer will be reported intellicast and cdb note components that were added to  or realigned to  the designated business unit are depicted in bold italics in the year impacted 
the ilec license business and palladium business were acquired from lpss in may we acquired bmd wireless ag business in february the voip product offering began to generate revenue in intellicast and commercial database  or cdb  product offerings will be transferred from new markets to wireline beginning in january  the palladium business will be discontinued in february and will be reported under discontinued operations in wireline results beginning in the first quarter of executive summary our revenue is derived from monthly data management services  ongoing software and hardware maintenance  sales of software enhancements  sales of new products and systems and professional services 
the majority of our revenue is derived from monthly data management services and ongoing maintenance of existing systems 
we consider this recurring revenue 
in  recurring revenue comprised million  or  of our total revenue of million 
in  recurring revenue accounted for million  or  of our million in total revenue 
in  recurring revenue represented million  or  of our total revenue of million 
the following is a summary level discussion of key business drivers in our segments 
a more detailed discussion is contained in the analysis of the results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources section 
the following table represents total revenue amounts in thousands and percentages by business unit year ended december  revenue percentage business unit wireline wireless new markets total the following table represents total operating income loss amounts in thousands and percentages by business unit year ended december  operating income loss percentage business unit wireline wireless new markets total we have made additional investments in facilities and infrastructure and have incurred additional personnel costs to support new market and product opportunities 
we have also reallocated resources when necessary to support our initiatives 
wireline the majority of our recurring revenue has been derived from our wireline segment 
we generally enjoy long term contractual relationships with our customers over terms up to years 
our revenue model in wireline is built on the basis of recurring fees and the number of records we either manage or support indirectly through licensing agreements 
we face limited competition in this segment 
the primary competitive risk we face is the possibility that our customers may decide to no longer outsource this service to us 
although we have long term contracts  our customers could decide to either not renew contracts or to cancel them prior to the end date and bring the services in house 
we have two primary customers in our ilec license business  and three primary customers in our ilec services business 
we renewed one of these ilec license agreements in our non recurring revenue for systems sales  software enhancements and sales of new products and services is dependent upon many factors  including length of sales cycles  market acceptance and product viability 
due to these uncertainties and the continued fiscal constraints facing customers  the frequency and magnitude of this incremental license revenue beyond recurring maintenance revenue can be difficult to predict 
we also face internal execution risk to identify  build and gain customer acceptance for these product and service offerings 
we expect the wireline segment to continue to provide the majority of our forecasted revenue  operating income and operating cash flows for the foreseeable future 
wireless revenue contribution in our wireless segment grew from million in to million in  an increase of 
we are executing strategies to deploy our services to the remaining contracted addressable market in a prudent fiscal and operational manner 
we believe our ability to successfully deploy our services to the remaining addressable market under contract could provide additional recurring revenue into the future  absent customer cancellations of our contracts  loss of market share to our competitors or material price erosion with existing customers 
competition in the wireless segment for our services is much more prevalent than in our wireline segment 
we have one primary competitor  telecommunications systems inc competitive pressures create pricing and execution risk to our existing business 
however  we believe we are well positioned to retain our existing customer base and acquire additional market share 
contracts in our wireless segment are typically three years in length 
given the uncertainty that exists in the wireless segment as a result of recent mergers and consolidations  it is difficult to predict the long term viability of our core products and services 
in  seven of our largest wireless customer contracts are set to expire 
we are currently in discussions with these customers to either renew or extend our contracts 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts  nor can we predict the length of any renewals or extensions or the price we will be able to charge in the event we are successful 
on february   we completed the acquisition of bmd wireless to expand our product offerings outside of the united states 
bmd wireless provides core network messaging solutions  enabling cross network mobile and application messaging traffic for a wide range of mobile operators and service providers 
bmd wireless will focus primarily on designing  building and delivering messaging platforms  tools and solutions for wireless service providers 
due to competitive pressure in europe and a longer sales cycle than expected at the time of the acquisition  the financial results for bmd were lower than expected in as a result  we expect a significantly slower path for bmd s technology to penetrate the european and north american markets 
based on these trends  we determined in the fourth quarter of that the five year earnings forecast for bmd required a substantial downward revision 
as a result of the downward revision and an impairment analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of while the forecast for bmd is lower than originally anticipated when acquired  we continue to believe there is a market for bmd technology in the growing wireless market and continue to support and pursue sales opportunities under a refined marketing and sales strategy 
new markets in our new markets segment  we are pursuing revenue and customer diversification efforts outside of our traditional product and service initiatives 
the historical new market revenue streams have been derived from intellicast and cdb services 
our new markets segment presents unique challenges and competitive pressures beyond those we have traditionally faced 
we believe the viability for our products exists  as evidenced by our existing customer base and recent customer wins 
however  the sales cycles have been longer than we originally anticipated 
intellicast we are pursuing intellicast sales at the federal  state and local government level 
our success to date in intellicast has been primarily at the city and county government level 
as of december   we had million billable telephone numbers in our database 
we need to increase the number of telephone numbers under contract  as well as build revenue with the federal and state governments  in order to achieve profitability in this market 
if this occurs  we expect to continue to leverage our existing operating expenses 
we currently have channel sales agreements with two major ilecs to jointly promote our products 
we intend to increase our sales efforts at the federal government level and we are pursuing further opportunities with agencies such as federal emergency management agency  national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the department of homeland security 
we have also partnered with the national center for missing and exploited children to promote our product offerings and to gain access to decision makers at the federal  state and local government levels 
current revenues are generated from ongoing data management services and event launches  such as the delivery of voice and tdd telephonic warnings about potential disasters and public safety issues to geographically targeted populations 
the successes with the product have provided momentum to our sales efforts 
however  sales cycles in intellicast are much longer than our traditional cycles and have proven to be more difficult to forecast due to unpredictable customer buying patterns and lack of available funding 
we believe recent legislation such as the burns clinton bill will provide a potential impetus to matching and direct governmental funding that could reduce the sales cycles among our target customers 
commercial database cdb we believe there are opportunities for us to leverage our long term customer relationships to gain entry and traction in the cdb markets 
we are engaged in a substantial effort to retool our cdb product offerings to serve the larger commercial data opportunities we have identified 
however  in the second quarter of we determined that  due to the continued limited visibility regarding the timing of forecasted revenue opportunities  it was necessary to impair the entire million of software assets 
when we evaluated the net realizable value of the product  we prepared a forward looking business case that assessed the future expected benefits to be derived from the asset against the direct costs associated with the delivery and ongoing support of the product to arrive at a contribution margin  defined as expected benefits less direct costs 
the contribution margin was then compared to the carrying value of the asset 
the expected contribution margin was significantly less than the asset carrying value  resulting in the impairment charge 
while we continue to believe there are market opportunities in this area  we have significantly lowered our revenue expectations until market conditions improve 
as a result  we also reduced operating expenses and re aligned resources to correlate with existing customer contracts 
if market penetration is obtained and additional contracts are signed in this area  we may make additional operating investments  but only when those opportunities actually materialize 
we continue to remain patient in our pursuit of both the intellicast and cdb market opportunities 
we continue to invest in product enhancements in both markets  albeit at a lower level than originally anticipated 
if sales conditions do not improve  we will further reduce our variable spending patterns to mitigate the impact of such conditions on our overall profitability 
we will be reporting results from both the intellicast and cdb product offerings as part of our wireline business unit beginning in the first quarter of critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
while preparing these financial statements  we made estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory  goodwill and intangible assets  capitalized software costs  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition amortization periods on remaining deferred revenue and cost balances as of december   we had approximately million in deferred revenue and million in deferred costs 
of these amounts  million of the deferred revenue balance and million of the deferred cost balance was classified as short term 
the majority of these balances relate to services previously provided to wireless customers and require deferral under staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition sab  since we have remaining service obligations 
it has been our policy to amortize these balances over the remaining future service period  which has historically been the remaining contractual life 
in most cases  we engage in renewal strategies well before the end of the contract 
however  we cannot estimate with any certainty which contracts will be extended and for how long 
this is especially relevant in the wireless segment  based on uncertainty that exists within the industry due to potential consolidation of carriers and the financial decisions our customers have made in the past or may make in the future related to utilizing our service offerings 
therefore  we have not extended the amortization periods for the remaining balances beyond the existing contractual life 
as there can be no assurances that the contracts will be extended  or  if extended  for what period of time  we continue to believe that the best estimate of the customer relationship period is the existing contractual life 
use of estimates and judgment related to recognizing revenue for percentage of completion and multiple element arrangements revenue is accounted for as either software revenue and related post contract support  product revenue  or services revenue in accordance with the guidelines provided by sop  software revenue recognition  sab  which superseded sab  and ftb accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
our policy is to recognize revenue when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met  which generally include the following persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we deliver products and services that are part of multiple element arrangements 
in addition to the above criteria from sab and sop  we also apply the guidance in emerging issues task force  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  which requires us to evaluate vendor specific objective evidence vsoe for contracts under sop and vendor objective evidence voe for contracts under sab to determine the fair value of elements delivered in situations where multiple elements exist 
the majority of our revenue is derived from long term service agreements with our customers and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract as services are performed 
revenues from monthly data management services include up front and monthly service fees 
our up front services consist primarily of the data cleansing of the customer s records  engineering services to enable the customer s legacy system to interface with our platform  thereby establishing network connectivity  public safety boundary mapping  customer training and testing 
the charges for these services are nonrefundable if the contract is cancelled after the services are performed 
after the initial up front services  data management customers often buy enhancements to these services  such as additional software engineering to improve system functionality or network services to make their network more effective enhancement services 
the fees received for up front services and certain enhancement services are deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract or the expected life of the customer relationship  whichever is longer  as these fees do not represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
we also receive a monthly service fee to provide the ongoing data management services required to keep the records current for all subscribers  to maintain and monitor network components and to support and maintain the software and systems required to provide the services 
the fees received for these monthly services are recognized as revenue in the period in which all of the above criteria have been met  which is generally the month services are provided 
for data management services we perform under our outsourced or licensed model  customers do not have a contractual right to take possession of our software  therefore  we account for these arrangements as service contracts 
maintenance contracts are sold to customers that either purchase or possess database and call handling systems 
the fees received for ongoing maintenance obligations are deferred and recognized as revenue over the contractual term of the arrangement 
systems and new products revenue represents revenue recognized from the sales of new database and call handling systems as well as customized solutions sold to existing customers 
software license revenue and related hardware sales are recognized upon execution of a contract and completion of delivery obligations  provided that no uncertainties exist regarding customer acceptance and that collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
professional services revenue is generated by providing consulting services and is recognized in the period in which all of the above criteria have been met 
in certain situations involving the delivery of products with significant customization or modification services  we also recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis  as prescribed by sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in these situations  we develop and utilize estimates to ratably recognize costs and revenue as work is completed relative to the total estimated time and costs to complete projects 
delays in completing projects or significant changes to original cost estimates could adversely impact future periods in that additional costs or amortization periods for both revenue and expenses may be necessary 
when reasonable estimates cannot be determined at the onset of an agreement due to unique acceptance criteria or other factors  revenue is recognized on a completed contract basis 
software capitalization as of december   we had million in net capitalized software assets 
capitalization of software under sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  requires judgment in determining when and if a project is in the application development stage  when the software is available for general release and its intended use  the expected benefits to be derived from the software product  the useful life of the software product  and the future recoverability of the capitalized amounts 
capitalization of software under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  requires judgment in determining when and if a project has reached technological feasibility  when the software is available for general release  the expected benefits to be derived from the software product  the useful life of the software product  and the future recoverability of the capitalized amounts 
in assessing the recoverability of our existing capitalized software assets  we rely on estimates and judgments to determine the net realizable value of each product 
when evaluating the net realizable value of a given product  we prepare a forward looking business case that includes an assessment of future expected benefits to be derived from the asset 
the expected benefits are compared to the direct costs associated with the delivery and ongoing support of the product to arrive at a contribution margin  defined as expected benefits less direct costs 
this contribution margin is compared to the current carrying value of the asset at the reporting date 
if the contribution margin exceeds the current asset carrying value plus any additional investments  such as hardware or additional development required to enhance or maintain the product  no impairment is recorded 
if the contribution margin is less than the carrying value  the asset carrying value is impaired to equal the expected contribution margin 
our ability to estimate future expected benefits to be derived from the asset  with a measured degree of probability  is the most significant factor in our impairment analysis 
if our ability to estimate the expected benefits changes significantly in any given period  we could record impairment charges for certain assets 
each quarter  we also assess the expected benefit period of the assets and amortize the related assets over the expected benefit period 
if our estimate of benefit period is impacted  we could adjust our estimated amortization periods accordingly  having either a positive or negative impact on earnings in the period the estimate is changed 
in we recorded million in software impairment charges 
goodwill and long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles or long lived assets  including property and equipment and goodwill  annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  or our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the estimated discounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition and compare the result to the asset s carrying amount 
any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
allowances we maintain allowances and reserves for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and for credit memos which may be granted to customers in future periods that relate to revenue recognized in current periods 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or concessions or discounts are granted in future periods which exceed our estimates  additional allowances and reserves may be required 
deterioration in the financial condition of our current customers may cause our allowance for doubtful accounts to increase and our future operating results to be adversely affected 
in the normal course of our business  we may be involved in billing disputes with certain customers 
the resolution of these disputes may result in the granting of credit memos to the customer 
deferred tax assets we follow sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
the current provision for income taxes represents actual or estimated amounts payable or refundable on tax returns filed each year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under sfas  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in enacted tax laws is recognized as an adjustment to the tax provision or benefit in the period of enactment 
the overall change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period is equal to the deferred tax expense or benefit for the period 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon the judgmental assessment of available evidence  it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments related to the recoverability of deferred tax assets as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
we currently do not have a reserve against our net deferred tax assets  with the exception of a valuation allowance of  that has been recorded against deferred tax assets in our intrado international  ltd 
subsidiary 
if expected taxable income is not generated in future years  it may be necessary to reverse some or all of the tax benefit recorded  adversely impacting tax expense and net income in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the third quarter of fiscal  beginning july  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  and we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our consolidated statements of operations reflected as a percentage of total revenue revenues costs and expenses direct costs sales and marketing general and administrative research and development total costs and expenses income from operations interest income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss direct costs includes goodwill and other asset impairment charges of million  or  in general and administrative expenses included million  or  in related to inventory impairment charges for assets acquired in the lpss acquisition in year ended december  compared to year ended december  total company revenues total revenues increased million to million in the increase is primarily attributable to increased revenue in the wireless unit of million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk to the extent that united states interest rates change due to inflation or other factors 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
the interest payable on our line of credit is determined based on the lower of prime rate plus or libor plus per annum  and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on our capital lease lines are dependent on interest rates in effect at the time the lease line is drawn upon 
total liabilities outstanding at december  under the line of credit and capital lease lines were approximately million 
based on amounts borrowed as of december   we would have a resulting decline in future annual earnings and cash flows of approximately  for every increase in prime lending rates 
we have no plans to use derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities
