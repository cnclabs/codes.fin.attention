management overview logo general dynamics designs  develops  manufactures and supports leading edge technology products and services for mission critical information systems and technologies  land and expeditionary combat systems  armaments and munitions  shipbuilding and marine systems  and business aviation 
the company s primary customers are the us military  other government organizations  the armed forces of allied nations and a diverse base of corporate and industrial buyers 
it operates through four primary business groups information systems and technology  combat systems  marine systems and aerospace and a small resources group 
the company has two primary business markets defense and business aviation 
the majority of the company s revenues derive from contracts with the us military 
current us policy is to pursue the global war on terrorism  encourage the spread of democratic institutions and significantly enhance homeland defense efforts 
us military doctrine provides that these diverse and demanding missions require us armed forces that are equipped and trained to prevail quickly in small and large scale conflicts around the world 
current policy also dictates that success will require the transformation of us forces so they are more strategically mobile  operationally lethal and tactically survivable 
these endeavors have driven steady funding increases for the us department of defense since for fiscal year  the congress appropriated billion for the department of defense  a percent increase in funding since this amount includes billion for procurement and research and development r d activities  an increase of percent since procurement and r d budgets provide the majority of the company s revenues 
their sustained increases demonstrate solid administration and congressional support 
with previously approved and recently announced supplemental funding  the congress is being asked to provide additional funding for operations in iraq and afghanistan  bringing the department of defense s total funding for fiscal year to over billion  approximately a percent increase since over percent of the supplemental spending will go toward additional procurement  as currently requested by the president 
the us army will receive billion of that request  and the us marine corps will get billion  assuming the congress approves the president s request 
for fiscal year  the president has requested that the congress appropriate billion for the department of defense  a percent increase over this includes billion for procurement and r d 
overall  while department of defense funding levels may change over time  the company expects the levels of funding available for its programs to remain consistent for and logo general dynamics annual report the global defense market is shaped largely by the demands of the us military 
many foreign governments remain committed to funding weapons and equipment modernization in the pursuit of interoperability with us and allied forces and flexible capabilities for peacekeeping and regional operations 
the company continues to focus on the needs of these customers and expects growing international sales 
the aerospace group is one of the world s leading designers and manufacturers of business jet aircraft and is a leader in the long range and ultra long range  large cabin business jet market  as well as in the business jet service and product support market 
the group s market is influenced in part by the capital goods sector and the demand for business aviation products by us and foreign businesses  the us and other governments  and high net worth individuals 
the business aviation market improved considerably during  with an increase in demand  a reduction in aircraft inventory both new and pre owned and a firming in pricing 
the increase in demand was across the aerospace group s customer base  reflecting the improved global economy and higher us corporate earnings 
the cost containment and efficiency initiatives that the company implemented in resulted in a marked increase in the group s earnings and margins in the company expects that the business aviation market will continue to improve and that the group will continue to benefit from that improvement and from its management and cost reduction initiatives 
general dynamics management is committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices  disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements 
the company has proven itself over the past years as an industry leader in generating strong cash flows  which have enabled it to enhance returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions  payment of dividends and share repurchases 
consolidated overview results of operations general dynamics net sales increased percent in over to billion 
this growth resulted from increased volume across all of the company s primary business groups and in part from acquisitions in the information systems and technology and combat systems groups 
the information systems and technology group provided the most significant contribution to the sales growth in as a result of strong demand for its communications and information technology products and services 
the company s performance followed sales growth of percent in the company s net sales increased to billion in from billion in this increase was driven by acquisitions in the information systems and technology and combat systems groups and increased volume in the company s defense businesses  reduced in part by lower sales of new aircraft in the aerospace group 
in  general dynamics focus on operations and program execution resulted in substantial improvement in the company s earnings and operating margins over operating earnings increased percent from  double the rate of sales growth  to billion in all of the company s major business units contributed to this performance 
the aerospace group improved its earnings significantly on effectively the same volume as the marine systems group experienced reduced losses in its commercial shipbuilding business compared with  which also contributed to higher earnings in overall  the company s operating margins increased to percent in from percent in  reflecting the increased demand for the company s products and services  the successful integration of businesses acquired in and improved processes that resulted in significant cost reductions 
operating earnings in decreased percent from to billion 
the impact of increased volume across the company and acquisitions in the information systems and technology and combat logo general dynamics annual report systems groups was offset by decreased earnings in the marine systems and aerospace groups 
earnings were down in those groups in due to performance problems on commercial shipbuilding contracts and reduced sales of new aircraft and market pricing pressures at gulfstream 
the company generated substantial cash flow from operating activities in and  significantly exceeding net earnings in each year 
in  cash flow from operating activities approximated net earnings 
net cash provided by operating activities was billion in compared with billion in and billion in the company used its cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures  repurchase its common stock  pay dividends and reduce debt 
general and administrative g a expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to percent in compared with percent in and percent in g a was billion in  billion in and in in  the company had net expense from non operating items of compared with income of in in  income from non operating items was  which included a gain from the sale of certain assets of combat systems space propulsion operation 
net interest expense increased to in from in because of a higher average borrowing balance from the company s issuance of additional debt in used to fund acquisitions 
net interest expense was in the company s effective tax rate was percent in  percent in and percent in the tax rate was lower than the other years because of the settlement of the to audit cycle with the internal revenue service and the resolution of some outstanding state tax disputes 
these events resulted in non cash benefits in totaling  favorably impacting the company s tax rate by percent 
in  general dynamics reviewed its businesses to identify operations that were not core to the company and could be divested 
as a result  the company completed the sale of two businesses in and entered into definitive agreements to sell two additional businesses  both of which closed in the first quarter of the company s reported net sales for all periods presented exclude the revenues associated with these businesses 
their earnings  however  are included as discontinued operations  net of income taxes  for all periods 
for additional discussion of these divestiture activities  see note c to the consolidated financial statements 
the company exited its undersea fiber optic cable laying business in the fourth quarter of because of substantial overcapacity in the market and a lack of contract backlog 
the results of this business operations in are included as discontinued operations  net of income taxes 
the company recognized an after tax loss of  including an after tax charge of for ship lease obligations and the write down of assets to net realizable value upon disposal of this business 
logo general dynamics total backlog reached its highest level ever  billion  and the funded backlog grew percent over to billion at december  each of the company s business groups experienced significant new order activity in  resulting in total new orders of billion during the year 
the total backlog for the company s defense businesses was billion at the end of  up billion over year end the defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts 
the funded portion of this backlog grew percent in to billion 
this includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer  as well as commitments by international customers that are also approved and funded by their governments 
the unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated 
the backlog does not include work awarded under indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
the total potential value of these contracts  which may be realized over the next years  was approximately billion as of december  the aerospace group s total backlog at december   was billion  an increase of percent over perhaps more important  the aerospace funded backlog  which is an indicator of near term demand  increased percent in to billion 
this growth reflects the increase in demand for new aircraft throughout the year that culminated in a record number of orders in the fourth quarter 
the funded backlog includes orders for which the company has definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer 
the unfunded backlog of billion at year end consists of options to purchase new aircraft and agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 
the resources group s backlog was at year end  of which was funded 
general dynamics annual report review of operating segments information systems and technology results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the information systems and technology group s sales and earnings increased significantly in compared with the group enjoyed growing demand in all of its markets tactical and strategic mission systems  intelligence mission systems  and network infrastructure and information technology it services including communication products  such as the bowman program for the united kingdom s armed forces and the warfighter information network tactical win t program for the army  global mission solutions  including the intelligence information  command and control equipment and enhancements ice contract for the us air force  surveillance and reconnaissance systems  and network infrastructure and wireless systems 
acquisitions in and were the other major driver of the sales growth  contributing about half of the increase over the group s operating margins were down slightly from because of a change in the mix of program deliveries through the year and lower margin businesses acquired in the second half of of note  the group s overall margins improved in over the fourth quarter of as it continued to integrate these businesses 
during  the company completed two acquisitions in the group spectrum astro  inc  in july and tripoint global communications inc  in september 
these acquisitions enhance the group s offerings in space vehicle integration and mobile communications 
the company expects the information systems and technology group to experience single digit sales growth in operating margins should remain similar to average margins in  though margins may fluctuate from period to period based on contract mix and timing of deliveries 
the group will continue to focus on operations and program performance and the integration of the businesses acquired in year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin in  the group experienced significant sales and earnings growth over as a result of increased volume in several areas of the business  including infrastructure and it support services  communications systems  ruggedized computing equipment and high speed encryption products 
the acquisitions of veridian corporation and digital system resources  inc  in the third quarter of also contributed significantly to the sales and earnings growth  though the lower margins associated with these businesses reduced the group s overall operating margins as discussed above 
logo the information systems and technology group s backlog grew to a record billion in  an increase of percent over the group s funded backlog  representing over percent of the total backlog  increased by billion in unlike the company s other defense businesses  the information systems and technology group s backlog is made up primarily of a large number of mid size contracts and programs 
however  saw an unusually high number of awards for large scale  long term programs in the defense market for communications and it products and services 
the group received many of these significant awards during the year  leading to the substantial increase in backlog 
the army selected the information systems and technology group as the prime contractor for its win t program 
win t is the army s key initiative designed to transform its tactical communications network from the current general dynamics annual report system to support the future force 
the entire win t program has a potential value of billion through  and work is expected to be shared evenly with the company s principal subcontractor 
the group was also awarded cluster of the joint tactical radio system jtrs  a contract worth to develop small  lightweight software defined radios for use by all branches of the usmilitary in systems ranging from handhelds to unattended sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles 
the jtrs program is designed to transform joint service operations by providing communication flexibility and adaptability to fighting forces 
if all options are exercised  the contract has a potential value of over billion through the group is part of a team that was selected by the us navy to build the mobile user objective system muos  a narrowband tactical satellite communications system 
the information systems and technology group will lead the segments of the muos program that supply network management  satellite control and a secure ground network  as well as a jtrs compliant terminal solution 
the subcontract is valued at over the group is also a member of a team that was selected as canada s maritime helicopter project mhp provider 
the mhp program calls for the replacement of canada s aging fleet of marine helicopters with state of the art helicopters to be used for anti submarine patrols  surveillance  search and rescue and disaster relief 
the company has been selected to provide the integrated mission systems for the new helicopters and related support for years under a subcontract arrangement with a potential value of up to billion 
the information systems and technology group was also awarded a five year contract valued at approximately to continue its support of the us joint forces command s joint experimentation program and joint futures lab  which develops new warfighting concepts  organizational structures and emerging technologies 
the company has supported this program for the past six years  providing services such as r d  engineering  and formulation and analysis of joint operational concepts 
the information systems and technology group s backlog at the end of also includes several international programs  reflecting the demand for its products and services overseas 
the group s most significant international contract is the bowman program  a secure digital voice and data communications system for the uk armed forces 
the group s year end backlog includes approximately billion for the bowman program 
the group s backlog does not include approximately billion of potential contract value awarded under idiq contracts 
idiq contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed 
these agreements set forth the majority of the contractual terms  including prices  but are funded as delivery orders are placed 
a significant portion of this idiq value represents contracts for which the company has been designated as the sole source supplier over several years to design  develop  produce and integrate complex products and systems for the military or other government agencies 
management believes that the customers intend to fully implement these systems 
however  because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders  the company recognizes these contracts in backlog only when they are funded 
the company was awarded several significant idiq contracts during  including one of four contracts under the air force s network centric solutions netcents program 
under the netcents program  the company will provide information technology  networking  and voice  video and data communications products and services to support the air force s global information requirements 
the multiple award idiq program has a three year base period with two one year options and a potential value of billion 
in addition  the information systems and technology group was awarded one of information technology systems support itss iii contracts by the us department of justice doj to provide state of the art it services and project related hardware to doj organizations and other federal agencies 
this multiple award idiq program has a performance period of seven years and a ceiling value of approximately billion 
combat systems results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the combat systems group posted solid increases in net sales and operating earnings in compared with strengthened by acquisitions completed in  the group s volume increased in as demand for its products grew both in the united states and abroad 
in particular  the group s sales of armored vehicles in europe  including leopard tanks  ulan infantry fighting vehicles and piranha combat vehicles  increased significantly in in addition  the group experienced increased activity on its contract to develop manned ground vehicles for the army s future combat systems fcs program and in its munitions and armaments businesses 
these gains were partially offset by lower volume on some combat vehicle production programs  including fewer m abrams tank upgrades and reduced deliveries on the stryker program due to the timing of customer requirements 
operating earnings increased at almost double the rate of the group s sales growth in a shift in contract mix and improved performance on general dynamics annual report a number of the group s programs  including fcs  stryker and tactical air munitions contracts  contributed to the strong earnings performance 
the company expects the combat systems group s sales to increase significantly in based on the group s solid backlog and opportunities for growth in the united states and internationally 
operating margins in should approximate those achieved in year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin in  the combat systems group experienced substantial growth in net sales and operating earnings due largely to several acquisitions during the year 
in  the company acquired general motors defense  intercontinental manufacturing company and steyr daimler puch spezialfahrzeug aktiengesellschaft company kg 
in addition  increased activity on the leopard tank production program  growing contributions to the army s fcs program and solid performance in the company s munitions and armaments businesses augmented the contributions of acquired businesses 
this growth was reduced in part by fewer m abrams main battle tank upgrades and reduced deliveries of the pizarro advanced infantry fighting vehicle in spain 
logo the combat systems group s total backlog increased in to billion at year end 
the group s funded backlog grew by percent to reach billion at the end of the group s backlog consists primarily of long term production contracts with scheduled deliveries through the group s backlog at year end includes approximately for the production of stryker wheeled combat vehicles 
in  combat systems received orders from the army for vehicles valued at approximately to complete the fourth stryker brigade 
the group also was awarded three delivery orders worth for additional stryker combat vehicles  including the first production of the mobile gun system and nuclear  biological  and chemical reconnaissance variants 
in the first quarter of  the army ordered additional vehicles  valued at over  to equip the fifth stryker brigade 
the stryker program  which currently calls for a total of six brigades by  is a key component of the ongoing army transformation 
the army also awarded the combat systems group several contracts to extend the company s m abrams main battle tank program 
the first was a delivery order valued at under a contract to upgrade ma abrams tanks to the ma system enhancement program sep configuration 
through this program  the company retrofits ma tanks with improved electronics  command and control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank s effectiveness 
in january  the army awarded the company a modification worth to upgrade an additional ma abrams tanks 
during  the company was also awarded a delivery order for ma abrams integrated management aim material sets to be delivered by june in addition  the company was awarded a contract modification valued at to provide ma hardware kits for the egyptian co production program 
another significant award for the combat systems group in was a delivery order initiating a contract for the production of joint biological point detection systems jbpds 
the jbpds is a self powered instrument suite that rapidly detects and identifies biological warfare agents such as airborne viruses  bacteria and toxins 
this contract has a potential value of for approximately  systems through if all options are exercised 
internationally in  the government of portugal conducted a competition for armored vehicles and in december selected the group s pandur ii vehicle and funded the program 
a contract valued at over to produce armored combat vehicles was finalized and added to the backlog in the first quarter of in addition to the contract awards discussed above  combat systems backlog at year end includes several significant ongoing programs 
the group is contributing to the army s fcs program through the development of manned ground vehicles and the autonomous navigation system for unmanned and manned ground vehicles 
the group s backlog at the end of includes billion for this aspect of the fcs program 
the information systems and technology group is also participating in this program  providing the integrated computer system  sensor data management and mission planning and preparation services 
the fcs program has been restructured to deliver newly developed technologies to existing forces as soon as they are available  rather than waiting until all planned technology innovations are complete 
with this acceleration of new technologies  the army plans to focus on networking capabilities  unattended munitions  unmanned systems and manned ground vehicles 
general dynamics annual report the combat systems group s leopard program is a long term battle tank manufacturing contract for the spanish army under license from a german company 
the year end backlog includes billion for the production of leopard tanks  with deliveries scheduled through the group also produces pizarro advanced infantry fighting vehicles for the spanish army 
the group s backlog at the end of includes over for the production of pizarro vehicles scheduled for delivery through another key program in the combat systems group is the marine corps expeditionary fighting vehicle efv contract 
in  the company was awarded a contract modification to continue the system development and demonstration phase of the efv program  which deferred the beginning of low rate initial production from to the group s backlog at year end includes approximately for this effort 
program production  which currently calls for over  vehicles  is scheduled to begin in and continue into the combat systems year end backlog also includes over billion in armament  munitions and composite structures programs 
the ammunition programs include the production of hydra mm rockets  motors and warheads 
in  the group received orders worth approximately from the usarmy aviation and missile command for the hydra program 
these orders extended deliveries through and brought the total contract value to date to also in  the usarmy joint munitions command awarded the group worth of modifications to a contract for the production of mk series bomb bodies 
the contract has a total potential value of  and deliveries are scheduled through marine systems results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin in  the marine systems group s net sales grew as a result of higher activity on engineering and repair contracts and several early stage production and development programs  including the t ake combat logistics ships  the conversion of trident ballistic missile submarines to a conventional strike configuration ssgn and the virginia class submarine program 
the growth in sales was partially reduced by lower volume on commercial shipbuilding contracts and mature production programs  including the delivery of the final seawolf class submarine 
the group s operating earnings and margins improved significantly in compared with because of improved results on the company s commercial shipbuilding programs in relative to the company experienced losses in the first quarter of on the construction of two roll on roll off cargo ships 
the two ships were delivered later in the year with no additional write offs 
later in  the group recorded losses on the first of four double hull oil tankers 
the losses totaled and were the result of labor hour and material cost growth 
the company s estimates to complete the tankers remained firm through the first half of however  after the first ship was delivered in the third quarter of  the company identified additional performance problems related to schedule delays and subcontractor difficulties 
as a result  the company recorded additional losses on the contract of in the second half of the second and third double hull tankers are scheduled for delivery in  with the fourth to be delivered in management continues to monitor the program closely in order to mitigate the risk of further cost growth 
the company expects the marine systems group s sales in to approximate the group s results in with slightly improved margins  assuming no further deterioration on the commercial tanker contract 
year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin in  the marine systems group s net sales increased over from increased activity on a number of design and early stage production contracts  including the virginia class  ssgn and t ake programs  as well as growth in engineering and repair work 
this growth was offset partially by lower activity on several mature ship construction programs 
earnings and margins declined in as a result of the performance issues on the two commercial shipbuilding programs discussed above 
logo general dynamics annual report the marine systems group s backlog at the end of was billion  consisting of numerous long term submarine and ship construction programs  along with repair and engineering contracts 
the group s funded backlog grew by billion  or percent  in  reaching billion at year end 
this backlog provides for shipbuilding programs through while the navy s future shipbuilding plan fluctuates over time  the group s current shipbuilding and submarine programs are well funded through the next several years 
the group s most significant contract in backlog is the virginia class submarine construction program 
the company has nine virginia class submarines under contract following the delivery of the lead ship in the class  the virginia  in october at year end  the group s backlog includes billion for the construction of these submarines 
the current navy plan calls for one submarine to be delivered per year 
the company is the prime contractor on this program  and construction is shared equally with its teaming partner 
the group s backlog at the end of includes billion for arleigh burke class ddg destroyers scheduled for delivery through this includes in funding awarded to the company in in january  the navy awarded the company an additional  which funded the final destroyer under contract in the ddg program 
during  the navy exercised options worth approximately for the fifth and sixth ships in the t ake program  a new class of combat logistics ships 
the group s backlog includes billion at year end for the construction of the first six ships with deliveries scheduled from through in january  the navy exercised additional options worth approximately for two more ships  bringing the total contract value to billion

the group also received approximately in contract modifications from the navy in to provide design  engineering  material and logistics support for strategic and attack submarines  r d for submarine research vehicles  and planning  scheduling and technical support for submarine maintenance activities 
these awards modify a contract awarded in march that has a potential value of billion over five years if all options are exercised 
in  the group received in modifications to its contract to convert four trident ballistic missile submarines to an ssgn configuration  a multi mission submarine optimized for conventional tactical strike and special operations support 
these awards modify a contract that the navy awarded to the marine systems group in and bring the total program value to over billion 
in january  the navy awarded the group an additional contract modification to continue the conversion 
the marine systems group leads one of two teams selected for the final stage of development for the littoral combat ship lcs  the navy s newest class of high speed surface combatants designed to operate in coastal areas against terrorist threats  high speed swarm boats  mines and diesel submarines 
in  the navy awarded the group an option worth to continue development of its proposed design for the lcs 
aerospace results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin aircraft deliveries in units green completion the aerospace group s sales increased slightly in compared with new aircraft deliveries and aircraft services activity were up while pre owned aircraft sales were lower 
the group s earnings and margins in grew considerably over this increase resulted from three factors substantial cost reductions  positive earnings on pre owned aircraft sales versus losses in and a combination of additional new aircraft deliveries and a more favorable mix of deliveries 
in  the company initiated a series of cost containment efforts and process improvements in response to declining market conditions and an oversupply of aircraft in the business jet market 
these steps removed significant costs from the group s new aircraft manufacturing process 
in addition  the company implemented a more disciplined approach to pre owned aircraft activity 
as a result  sales of pre owned aircraft in resulted in earnings of compared with losses of in these factors  combined with the increased volume and improved mix of aircraft deliveries  resulted in the significant rise in earnings and margins for the group in business jet market conditions improved significantly in demand for new aircraft increased steadily throughout the year  and there was a marked improvement in pricing in the order activity late in the year 
the group finished with a record number of orders in the fourth quarter and for the full year  excluding orders from fractional fleet customers 
with the production schedule substantially sold out  the company expects moderate sales growth in the aerospace group in with improving operating margins 
general dynamics annual report year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin aircraft deliveries in units green completion net sales and operating earnings decreased in compared with because of deterioration in the business jet market during the second half of and the first half of lower demand for new aircraft and oversupply of new and pre owned aircraft for sale in the market resulted in downward pricing pressures 
these factors lowered the group s sales and caused earnings and margins to decline in summary of aircraft statistical information sales contracts for new aircraft usually have two major milestones the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft s completion  which includes exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics 
the company records revenues when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer  and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 
the following table summarizes key unit data for the aerospace group s orders and backlog year ended december new orders options exercised firm orders a cancellations a total orders new options a firm contracts in backlog options in backlog total aircraft in backlog completions in backlog b a excludes fractional activity  because these orders are made under master agreements that the customer draws down over several years 
the company received orders for aircraft and options in and cancellations for seven aircraft in from fractional fleet customers 
b represents aircraft that have moved from green production to the completion process as of year end 
backlog includes only the value of the completion effort on these aircraft 
logo logo the aerospace group s backlog reached billion at year end approximately percent of the group s backlog  or billion  was funded at year end 
in  the group received the largest number of new aircraft orders in the company s history  excluding orders from fractional fleet customers 
the backlog includes aircraft deliveries scheduled through a significant portion of the group s backlog is with netjets inc netjets  a unit of berkshire hathaway and the leader in the fractional aircraft market 
the group s funded backlog at year end includes billion with netjets  representing firm contracts for aircraft  including green aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in the unfunded backlog includes billion for aircraft options from netjets  constituting all of the options in backlog 
netjets also represents percent of the maintenance and support services in unfunded backlog 
deliveries of aircraft to netjets are scheduled from through and represent as little as percent and as much as percent of projected new aircraft sales in those years 
general dynamics annual report the group s remaining billion of funded backlog at year end consists of contracts with a broad range of customers from a variety of industries and includes approximately of contracts with government customers 
logo resources the company s resources group principally consists of two businesses a coal mining company and an aggregates company that supplies the construction industry 
results of operations year ended december variance net sales operating earnings net sales in were down compared with as a result of decreased volume in the coal business offset in part by a slight increase in activity in the aggregates business 
the group s operating earnings were lower than because the earnings in were favorably impacted by the reduction of surface reclamation obligations in the company s coal mining operations 
year ended december variance net sales operating earnings net sales in decreased versus because of lower volume in the coal and aggregates businesses from unfavorable seasonal conditions 
the operating earnings were down from due to the volume decline and reduced earnings in the company s commercial pension plan 
in addition  the earnings were favorably impacted by the resolution of contingency reserves that had previously been established  due to an improved long term outlook for some of the coal operation s contracts 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources in the mid s  general dynamics embarked on a strategy of disciplined capital deployment  focusing on strong cash flow generation to enable a series of strategic and tactical acquisitions designed to grow the company beyond its core platform businesses 
these acquisitions incorporated new products and technologies and expanded the company s customer base 
since  the company has acquired businesses at a total cost of over billion 
this has resulted in a larger  more diversified company while preserving a strong balance sheet and sustained financial flexibility 
in  the company continued its strong performance of cash generation  with net cash provided by operating activities far surpassing net earnings for the second year in a row 
the company employed this cash to complete three niche acquisitions  continue its trend of annual dividend increases and pay down debt to further enhance an already strong balance sheet 
the company ended with a cash balance of  total debt of billion and a debt to capital ratio of percent 
free cash flow from operations totaled billion for both and  compared with in management defines free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
management believes free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors  because it portrays the company s ability to generate cash from its core businesses for such purposes as repaying maturing debt  funding business acquisitions and paying dividends 
the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities  as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows year ended december net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow from operations cash flows as a percentage of net earnings net cash provided by operating activities free cash flow from operations as discussed above  the company uses its free cash flow from operations in a disciplined capital deployment process to invest internally  make acquisitions  pay dividends and repurchase the company s shares in the open market 
with free cash flow from operations projected to approximate net earnings in  the company expects to continue to generate funds in excess of its short and long term liquidity needs 
management believes that the company has adequate funds on general dynamics annual report hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute its financial and operating strategy 
the following is a discussion of the company s major operating  investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended december   as classified on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
operating activities the company generated strong cash flow from operating activities in net cash provided by operating activities was billion in  billion in and billion in in each year  net earnings was the primary driver of the company s cash flow 
in  cash from operating activities exceeded net earnings primarily due to taxes paid being lower than the tax provision 
in  the increase in cash flow was attributable to substantial reductions in both new and pre owned aircraft inventory in the aerospace group and an influx of customer advances near the end of the year 
in  cash provided by operating activities approximated net earnings 
termination of a program 
as discussed further in note o to the consolidated financial statements  litigation on the a program termination has been ongoing since if  contrary to the company s expectations  the default termination is ultimately sustained  the company and the boeing company could collectively be required to repay the us government as much as billion for progress payments received for the a contract  plus interest  which was approximately billion at december  in this outcome  the government contends the company s liability would be approximately billion pretax  or after tax 
the company believes that it has sufficient resources to pay such an obligation  if required  while still retaining ample liquidity 
investing activities cash used in investing activities was in  compared with billion in and in the primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures

general dynamics annual report application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to long term contracts and programs  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  workers compensation  warranty obligations  pre owned aircraft inventory  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application revenue recognition government contracts 
the company accounts for sales and earnings under long term defense contracts and programs using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the company follows the guidelines of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  except that revisions of estimated profits on contracts are included in earnings under the reallocation method  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  rather than the cumulative catch up method 
under the reallocation method  the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining life of the contract  while under the cumulative catch up method such impact would be recognized immediately 
if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract  the company recognizes the loss in the period it is identified 
anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts  including g a expenses 
the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit evenly over the remaining life of the contract based on either input eg  costs incurred or output eg  units delivered measures  as appropriate to the circumstances 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion  and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
these estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years  including future labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the timing of product deliveries 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company s contracts 
the company reviews its contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 
business aircraft 
the company accounts for contracts for aircraft certified by the faa in accordance with statement of position these contracts usually provide for two major milestones the manufacture of the green aircraft ie  before exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics and its completion 
the company records revenue at two points when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 
the company does not recognize revenue at green delivery unless a contract has been executed with the customer and the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer 
pre owned aircraft inventories 
in connection with orders for new aircraft  the company routinely offers customers trade in options 
under these options  if exercised  the company will accept trade in aircraft at a predetermined price based on estimated fair value 
it is the company s policy to limit its investment in pre owned aircraft inventory at any point in time to  unless specifically authorized 
once acquired in connection with a sale of new aircraft  the company records pre owned aircraft at the lower of trade in value or estimated net realizable value 
the company treats any excess of the trade in price above the net realizable value as a reduction of revenue upon the recording of the new aircraft sales transaction 
the company also regularly assesses the carrying value of pre owned aircraft in inventory and adjusts the carrying value to net realizable value when appropriate 
the company determines net realizable value by using both internal and external aircraft valuation information 
these valuations involve estimates and assumptions about many factors  including current market conditions  future market conditions  the age and condition of the aircraft and the availability of the aircraft in the market 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment 
gross margins on sales of pre owned aircraft can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of aircraft sold and current market conditions 
general dynamics annual report commitments and contingencies 
the company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business or arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment 
the company records a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when the company s exposure is reasonably estimable 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
deferred contract costs 
certain costs incurred in the performance of the company s government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts 
such costs include a portion of the company s estimated workers compensation  other insurance related assessments  retirement benefits and environmental expenses 
these costs will become allocable to contracts when they are paid 
in accordance with aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  the company defers these costs in contracts in process until they are paid  at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government 
the company expects to recover these costs through ongoing business  including both existing backlog and probable follow on contracts 
this business base includes numerous contracts for which the company is the sole source or one of two suppliers on long term defense programs 
the company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs under its current and probable follow on contracts 
this assessment requires the company to make assumptions about future contract costs  the extent of cost recovery under the company s contracts and the amount of future contract activity 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment 
if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs  the profitability of the company s remaining contracts could be adversely affected 
pension plans 
the company makes assumptions about discount rates and long term rates of return on plan assets to determine its net periodic pension cost in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment  including consideration of both current and future market conditions 
the company considers both internal and external evidence to determine the appropriate assumptions 
in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted  future pension cost as determined under sfas could increase or decrease 
if the assumed rate of return on plan assets increased or decreased by basis points  the company s net pension income associated with its commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately in likewise  had the interest rate used to discount the company s projected pension obligation increased or decreased by basis points  the net pension income associated with the commercial plans would have increased or decreased by approximately in the company s contractual arrangements with the usgovernment provide for the recovery of contributions to the company s government plans 
in accordance with aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  the company has deferred recognition of the cumulative earnings in its government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses 
as such  the company s future income is not subject to the consequences of changes in the assumptions associated with these plans 
management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value 
sfas r is effective in the third quarter of the company expects the adoption of sfas r to reduce its net earnings by approximately in general dynamics annual report item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed rate long term debt obligations  variable rate commercial paper and short term investments 
as of december   the company had no short term investments 
fixed rate debt obligations issued by the company are generally not putable and are not actively traded by the company in the market 
therefore  exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for the company s fixed rate debt 
a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates applicable to the company s commercial paper balances would not have a material effect on its results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
at december   no interest rate swap agreements were in effect 
the company also is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers  payments to suppliers  long term debt and certain inter company transactions in foreign currencies 
the company principally uses foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments  receipts and inter company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities 
foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   a percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized loss of pretax and an incremental unrealized loss of pretax 
consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  such realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains  respectively  in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk
