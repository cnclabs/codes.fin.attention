revenue recognition revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to the dealer or distributor 
historically  product returns  whether in the normal course of business or resulting from repurchases made under the floorplan financing program have not been material 
however  polaris has agreed to repurchase products repossessed by the finance companies up to certain limits 
polaris financial exposure is limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance companies and the amount received on the resale of the repossessed product 
no material losses have been incurred under these agreements 
polaris has not historically recorded any significant sales return allowances because it has not been required to repurchase a significant number of units 
however  an adverse change in retail sales could cause this situation to change 
sales promotions and incentives polaris generally provides for estimated sales promotion and incentive expenses  which are recognized as a reduction to sales  at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor 
examples of sales promotion and incentive programs include dealer and consumer rebates  volume discounts  retail financing programs and sales associate incentives 
sales promotion and incentive expenses are estimated based on current programs and historical rates for each product line 
polaris records these amounts as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
at december  and  accrued sales promotions and incentives were million and million  respectively  reflecting a slight decrease in the atv sales promotions and incentives environment during late partially offset by increased dealer inventory levels 
actual results may differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if the customer usage rate varies from historical trends 
adjustments to sales promotions and incentives accruals are made from time to time as actual usage becomes known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to generate consumer demand based on market conditions as of the balance sheet date 
historically  sales promotion and incentive expenses have been within the company s expectations and differences have not been material 
dealer holdback programs polaris provides dealer incentive programs whereby at the time of shipment polaris withholds an amount from the dealer until ultimate retail sale of the product

polaris standard warranties require the company or its dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer 
the warranty reserve is established at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor based on management s best estimate using historical rates and trends 
polaris records these amounts as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
at december  and  the warranty reserve was million and million  respectively 
adjustments to the warranty reserve are made from time to time based on actual claims experience in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while management believes that the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
product liability polaris is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
polaris self insures its product liability claims 
the estimated costs resulting from any losses are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable 
the company utilizes historical trends and actuarial analysis tools to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels 
at december  and the company had accruals of million and million  respectively  for the possible payment of pending claims 
these accruals are included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
while management believes the product liability reserve is adequate  adverse determination of material product liability claims made against the company could have a material adverse effect on polaris financial condition

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inflation  foreign exchange rates and interest rates polaris does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on the results of its operations in however  the changing relationships of primarily the us dollar to the canadian dollar  euro and japanese yen have had a material impact from time to time 
during  purchases totaling percent of polaris cost of sales were from japanese yen denominated suppliers 
the weakening of the us dollar in relation to the japanese yen has resulted in higher raw material purchase prices during polaris cost of sales in was negatively impacted by the japanese yen exchange rate fluctuation when compared to the prior year 
in view of the foreign exchange hedging contracts entered into in early  polaris anticipates that the yen dollar exchange rates will have a slightly negative impact on cost of sales during the hedged periods of when compared to polaris operates in canada through a wholly owned subsidiary 
sales of the canadian subsidiary comprised percent of total polaris sales in from time to time  polaris utilizes foreign exchange hedging contracts to manage its exposure to the canadian dollar 
the us dollar weakened in relation to the canadian dollar in which resulted in a positive financial impact on polaris gross margins when compared to the same periods in in view of the foreign exchange hedging contracts currently in place  polaris anticipates that the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rates will have a favorable impact on net income during compared to for the hedged periods 
in the past  polaris has been a party to  and in the future may enter into  foreign exchange hedging contracts for the japanese yen  euro  and the canadian dollar to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations within each year

at december   the company had no japanese yen or euro foreign exchange hedging contracts in place 
the fair values of the canadian dollar hedge contracts at december  represent an unrealized loss of million 
a ten percent fluctuation in the currency rates as of december  would have resulted in a change in the fair value of the canadian dollar hedge contracts of approximately million 
however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged
