words such as expects  anticipates  targets  goals  projects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this report under the section entitled factors that may affect future results and elsewhere  and in other reports the company files with the securities and exchange commission sec  specifically the most recent reports on form q and the joint proxy prospectus included in the registration statement on form s filed with the sec and declared effective on march  the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  warranty costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long term assets  especially goodwill and intangible assets  contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
overview of the results of operations to aid in understanding our operating results for the years ended december   and  we believe an overview of the significant events that affected those periods and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses is helpful 
significant events in april  we completed our acquisition of netscreen technologies  inc netscreen in order to expand our customer base and portfolio of products 
netscreen developed  marketed and sold a broad array of integrated network security solutions for enterprises  carriers and government entities 
we have included in our results of operations the results of netscreen beginning on april   therefore  revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses are significantly greater during compared to and as a result of the netscreen acquisition  we expanded our customer base and portfolio of products  which resulted in two categories of networking products infrastructure products  which consist predominately of the original juniper networks products  and security products  which consist predominately of the former netscreen products 
in july  we completed our acquisition of unisphere  a subsidiary of siemens corporation  which is a subsidiary of siemens ag siemens 
since the acquisition siemens has been one of our significant resellers 
unisphere developed  manufactured and sold data networking equipment optimized for applications at the edge of service provider networks 
the acquisition enabled us to expand our 
table of contents customer base and add a complementary product to our existing infrastructure product line without any need to reorganize or modify our existing organizational or cost structure 
we have included in our results of operations for the results of unisphere from july  the unisphere acquisition impacted revenue  cost of revenues and all operating expenses for the second half of the results for include a full year of results of the combined companies 
we have implemented several restructuring plans over the last four years as a result of the economic slowdown  which began in  and the acquisitions of unisphere and netscreen 
in connection with the acquisitions of unisphere and netscreen  we initiated plans to eliminate certain duplicative activities  focus on strategic product and customer bases  reduce cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions 
during the three months ended september   we announced that we would no longer develop our g series cmts products and recorded a charge that was comprised of workforce reduction costs  non inventory asset impairment  costs associated with vacating facilities and terminating contracts and other related costs 
during  we adjusted our restructuring reserves for changes in estimates  primarily related to changes in lease and sublease assumptions as our needs changed as a result of the netscreen acquisition and as the real estate markets changed 
during the three months ended june   we issued million of zero coupon convertible senior notes due june  senior notes 
from january  through december   we paid million to retire all of our remaining convertible subordinated notes due march  subordinated notes 
these transactions affected our cash  cash equivalents  investments  interest income and interest expense 
nature of expenses netscreen had a significant distribution channel in place at the time of the acquisition and we are using that channel to target new customers and increase sales 
we plan to increase the volume of sales that go through our distribution channel during compared to prior years 
this shift to selling more products through a distribution channel may impact gross margins 
most of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers  accordingly  most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs 
the independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications  quality assurance programs and standards that we establish 
controls around manufacturing  engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale  california and westford  massachusetts 
our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in wisconsin  canada and malaysia 
generally  our contract manufacturers retain title to the underlying components and finished goods inventory until our customers take title to the assembled final product upon shipment from the contract manufacturer s facility 
the contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts  we may be  and have been in the past  liable for carrying or obsolete material charges 
carrying and obsolete charges have decreased each of the past two years as the global economy and our product revenue improved 
employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue 
employee related costs include items such as wages  commissions  bonuses  vacation  benefits and travel 
we added over employees across all functions as a result of the netscreen acquisition 
we added approximately employees from the unisphere acquisition in july we had   and  employees as of december   and  respectively 
facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount 
these departmental costs have increased each of the last two years due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from acquisitions and additional infrastructure systems to support the company s growth 
we expect these costs to continue to increase during as our headcount increases 

table of contents research and development expenses include the costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products  outside services for such services as certifications of new products  equipment used for testing and patent related costs 
several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures  such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment  the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
we plan to increase our investment in research and development during compared to prior years to further advance our competitive advantage 
sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services  demonstration equipment and advertisements 
these costs vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues  product launches and marketing initiatives 
we plan to further develop our distribution channel and increase our sales and marketing costs in an effort to expand and grow our presence in new markets  serving both private and public networks with a full portfolio of networking security products 
general and administrative expenses include professional fees  bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses 
professional fees include legal  audit  tax  accounting and certain corporate strategic services 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these policies include revenue recognition  estimating future warranty costs and the valuation of exposures associated with the contract manufacturing operations  both of which impact cost of product revenues and gross margins  the provision for income taxes  which impacts our income tax expense  and tax related accruals  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which impacts general and administrative expenses  and the initial and continuing valuation of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  the impairment of which would impact operating expenses 
we have other important accounting policies and practices  however  once adopted  these other policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy and not a judgment as to the policy itself 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and also on assumptions that we believe are standard and reasonable 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ from those estimates for various reasons including those described in factors that may affect future results 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured  unless we have future obligations for such things as customer acceptance  in which case revenue and related costs are deferred until those obligations are met 
in most cases  we recognize product revenue upon shipment to our customers  including value added resellers var  as it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a var 
we defer revenues on sales to our distributors until we have information indicating that the distributor has sold the products to its customers 
we recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation 
a majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into service contracts 
service contracts are typically for one year renewable periods and are for services such as hour customer support  non specified updates and hardware repairs 
in addition to service contracts  we also provide professional and educational services 
on arrangements where products and services are bundled  we determine whether the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting 
we allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual deliverables either based on their relative fair values or using the residual method  as circumstances dictate 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition 
this process requires us to make judgments whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and whether we have established objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than the fair values 
in addition  our ability to recognize revenue in the future will be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers and by our assessment of collectibility 
we assess the probability of collection by reviewing our customers payment history  financial condition and credit report 
if the probability of collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until the payment is collected 
the amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is also impacted by our judgments made in establishing our reserve for potential future product returns 
although our arrangements with end users and vars generally do not include any contractual rights of return  and our general policy is that we do not accept returns  under certain circumstances we have accepted  and may in the future accept  product returns from our customers 
therefore  we do provide a reserve for our estimate of future returns against revenue in the period the revenue is recorded 
our estimate of future returns is based on such factors as historical return data and current economic condition of our customer base 
in addition  we get input from our sales and support organizations on potential product returns relating to specific customer issues 
the amount of revenue we recognize will be directly impacted by our estimates made to establish the reserve for potential future product returns 
in addition  our agreements with distributors provide for limited stock rotation and price protection rights 
stock rotation rights provide distributors with the right to exchange unsold inventory for alternate products of equal or greater value 
price protection rights grant distributors the right to a credit on certain purchases in the event of decreases in the prices of our products 
we accrue for these credits based on our estimates of expected stock rotation and price protection obligations 
these reserves require us to exercise judgment in determining if historical experience applies to new products and to new distributors 
if our estimate of returns and exchanges is too low  additional charges will be incurred in future periods and these additional charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our resellers and distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs  and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs 
if actual amounts paid to our resellers and distributors for these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates  which are based on inputs from our channel marketing department and historical experience  our revenue could be adversely affected 

table of contents warranty reserves we generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products 
the warranty generally includes parts and labor obtained through our hour service center 
on occasion  the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary 
we accrue for warranty costs based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations  including material costs  technical support labor costs and associated overhead 
the warranty accrual is included in our cost of revenues and is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims  costs per claim and estimated support labor costs and the associated overhead 
our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim are primarily based on historical information and future forecasts 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
if actual warranty claims are significantly higher than forecast  or if the actual costs incurred to provide the warranty is greater than the forecast  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
contract manufacturer exposures we outsource most of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them 
our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our build forecasts 
these forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products  which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations  adjusted for overall market conditions 
if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast  which may be caused by factors outside of our control  we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers  such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures  that would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
provision for income taxes and tax related accruals estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under sfas  accounting for income taxes  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable 
accordingly  a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the us domestic net deferred tax assets has been established to reflect uncertainty regarding future realization of these assets  in part  due to the potential impact of future stock option deductions 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed  a further charge to expense would result 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than previously seen 
we also consider our historical level of credit losses 
our reserves historically have been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
if actual credit losses were to be significantly greater than the reserves we have established  our general and administrative expenses would increase 
conversely  if actual credit losses were to be significantly less than our reserves  our general and administrative expenses would decrease 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization of purchased intangibles is computed using the straight line method over the related expected useful lives of between four and seven years 
goodwill is carried at fair value 
we perform goodwill impairment tests annually and on an interim basis in certain circumstances 
we performed an impairment analysis in november and determined that there was no impairment of the goodwill at that time 
in addition  on a quarterly basis we assess if there have been any impairment indictors during the past quarter that could have impacted the carrying value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
when valuing goodwill and purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment  we estimate the assets and liabilities of our two reporting units infrastructure and security  the market value of each reporting unit  future cash flows applicable to each reporting unit  and the useful lives 
these estimates include using our revenue and earnings multiples as of the test date  discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units and the periods of time with which the products will be in demand 
any changes in key assumptions about the business  reporting units and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
results of operations net revenues the following table shows product and service net revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  product net revenues service net revenues total net revenues our net revenues for each of the last three years have increased primarily as a result of the improving global economy  which resulted in increases in our customers capital expenditures for our products 
beginning in mid  the overall global economy deteriorated and most of our customers reduced their capital expenditure budgets 
we began to see these factors improve in  as was evidenced by the increases in infrastructure chassis revenue units and ports shipped 
the following table shows infrastructure revenue units and ports shipped for each of the last three years year ended december  infrastructure chassis revenue units infrastructure ports shipped infrastructure products contributed million to product net revenues during we track infrastructure revenue units and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth 
our infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular  with the chassis serving as the base of the platform 
each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces 
the modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media 
the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port 
the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module 
chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period 

table of contents security products contributed million to product net revenues during based on approximately  units and the acquisition enabled us to cross sell infrastructure and security products to both customer bases 
as we have expanded our market share and entered more markets in  we have begun to experience increased price competition 
this price competition has been limited to date  as evidenced by our increase in revenue dollars and product gross margins compared to the year ago period 
we expect to see increasing price competition and downward pressure on our product gross margins in the future 
service net revenues increased each of the last two years as a result of a larger installed base of customers and products 
a majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into service contracts 
siemens accounted for greater than of our net revenues during and ericsson ab ericsson accounted for greater than of our net revenues during and the following table shows net revenue by geographic region in thousands year ended december  americas europe  middle east and africa asia pacific total net revenues we experienced a shift in net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues from the americas region to europe and asia from to as our customers spending in the americas region declined  however  as our customers spending improved from to  the americas region grew as a percentage of total net revenues 
given the current environment  we expect the split among the americas and international regions to remain relatively consistent from to cost of revenues the following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin gm percentages for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  gm gm gm cost of product revenues cost of service revenues total cost of revenues the six point increase in product gross margins from to was primarily due to cost cutting initiatives that resulted in standard costs and manufacturing support costs increasing at a lesser rate than product net revenues in terms of absolute dollars for the same periods 
in addition  the standard margins on the security products are more favorable than the standard margins on the infrastructure products 
the improvement in gross margins was also a result of a million reduction in carrying and obsolescence charges from to as our historical charges paid to the contract manufacturers have decreased 
the increase in gross margins was partially offset by acquisition charges related to the netscreen acquisition  which increased cost of product revenues by million  for an inventory write up adjustment and the amortization of the order backlog intangible asset 

table of contents the five point increase in product gross margins from to was primarily due to savings in outsourced manufacturing costs as a result of improved efficiencies and cost cutting initiatives at our contract manufacturers 
the increase in product gross margins was also due to a million decrease in carrying and obsolete material charges from to in addition  included a charge of million related to the unisphere acquisition for backlog orders and an inventory write up adjustment 
service gross margins increased three points from to and seven points from to as a result of improved efficiencies and economies of scale that were a direct result of a larger installed base  and thus a more leveraged service organization 
this increased leverage is evidenced by the fact that total employee related expenses have decreased as a percentage of service revenue in each of the last two years for  for and for  however  in absolute dollars  employee related expenses increased million from to and million from to the increases in absolute dollars were due to the netscreen and unisphere acquisitions 
in addition  in absolute dollars  the outside services costs increased million from to  primarily due to the netscreen acquisition 
finally  the costs associated with spare parts decreased as a percent of service revenue from to and remained approximately the same in terms of absolute dollars  however the costs of spare parts increased as a percent of service revenue from to as the costs increased million in terms of absolute dollars 
research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the following table shows research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  research and development sales and marketing general and administrative research and development expenses increased million in compared to  but decreased as a percent of total net revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee related expenses increasing million year over year as a result of the netscreen acquisition 
the increase in research and development expenses was also the result of a million increase in expensed equipment primarily used in test activities and a million increase in prototype expense 
the increase in expensed equipment was due to additional research and development requirements resulting from the netscreen acquisition 
prototype expenses are closely tied to product launches because of the testing and certification needed before a product can be offered to the public  and the amounts reported in a given period can vary depending on the product being developed and the timing of the release 
research and development expenses increased million in compared to  but decreased as a percent of total net revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to a million increase in employee related expenses as a result of a full year of operations after the acquisition of unisphere 
in addition  we stopped paying bonuses in as part of our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives  however  we started to accrue employee bonuses in the second half of as our financial results improved 
offsetting the increase in employee related expenses was a million decrease in consulting and contractor services due to our overall corporate cost cutting initiatives and a million decrease in prototype expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million in compared to and increased as a percent of total net revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to employee related expenses increasing million year over year as a result of the netscreen acquisition and the increase in revenue 
marketing related expenses increased million due to the netscreen acquisition  the branding of the combined companies and the development of a distribution channel and 
table of contents channel sales 
outside services increased million due to professional services related to marketing activities 
in addition  demonstration equipment increased million due to the netscreen acquisition and the related purchase of security demonstration products for our direct sales force and resellers 
demonstration equipment is expensed immediately and is closely tied to product launches 
to date  we have not incurred significant advertising expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million in compared to  but decreased as a percent of total net revenues 
the majority of the increase in absolute dollars was a million increase in employee related expenses in the sales organization 
in addition  customer facing expenses such as marketing events and customer programs increased million 
offsetting the increases was a decrease of million for demonstration equipment 
general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to and remained at of total net revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars was driven by a million increase in professional services and a million increase in employee related expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million and as a percent of total net revenues in compared to the majority of the decrease was due to a million reduction in bad debt expense in compared to this reduction was a result of more successful than expected collection efforts and the absence of any significant customer bankruptcies 
the decrease in bad debt expense was partially offset by a million increase in professional services related to certain strategic consulting activities 
other operating expenses the following table shows other operating expenses for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred stock compensation restructuring costs in process research and development integration costs amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation the amortization expense of intangible assets increased million in compared to due to the intangible assets purchased in the netscreen acquisition 
the amortization expense of intangible assets increased million in compared to due to the intangible assets purchased in the unisphere acquisition 
see note in item for more information on our purchased intangible assets 
the amortization expense of deferred stock compensation increased million in compared to due to the netscreen acquisition 
amortization expense of deferred stock compensation was million and million in and  respectively 
see note in item for more information on our deferred stock compensation 
restructuring and other we have implemented several restructuring plans over the last four years as a result of the economic slowdown  which began in and began to improve in  and the acquisitions of unisphere and netscreen 
during  we reduced previously established restructuring reserves by 
table of contents million for changes in estimates  primarily related to changes in lease and sublease assumptions 
we found our needs changed as a result of the netscreen acquisition and as the real estate markets changed 
this reduction was offset by a restructuring charge of million during the three months ended june  primarily related to the netscreen acquisition 
the restructuring charge recorded in has been completely paid out 
the remaining restructuring charges from prior years are primarily for facility leases 
the following is a summary of the restructuring plans  the related charges and the remaining obligations at the time of the netscreen acquisition  we accrued for restructuring charges of million primarily related to professional services  severance and facility charges 
these charges were recorded as part of the acquisition and did not impact the statement of operations 
there is approximately million remaining to be paid  primarily for facility leases that extend through during the third quarter of  we announced that we are no longer developing our g series cmts products and recorded a charge of approximately million that was comprised of workforce reduction costs  non inventory asset impairment  vacating facilities costs  the costs associated with termination of contracts and other related costs 
there is approximately million remaining to be paid  primarily for a facility lease that extends through july during the third quarter of  in connection with the acquisition of unisphere  we recorded restructuring expenses of approximately million  associated primarily with workforce related costs  costs of vacating duplicative facilities  contract termination costs  non inventory asset impairment charges and other associated costs 
there is approximately million remaining to be paid  primarily for facility leases that extend through april at the time of the unisphere acquisition  we accrued for restructuring charges of million primarily related to professional services  severance and facility charges 
these charges were recorded as part of the acquisition and did not impact the statement of operations 
there is approximately million remaining to be paid  primarily for facility leases that extend through march we recognized a charge of approximately million during the third quarter of related to the land acquired in january located in sunnyvale  california 
the charge was primarily for costs of exiting certain contractual obligations associated with the land 
we currently have no plans to develop the land in the foreseeable future 
see note in item for a complete description of all restructuring charges and the amounts remaining to be paid 
in process research and development the allocation of the netscreen purchase price included million to in process research and development ipr d and was expensed in the second quarter of projects that qualify as ipr d represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
at the time of acquisition  netscreen had multiple ipr d efforts under way for certain current and future product lines 
these efforts included developing and integrating secure routers with embedded encryption chips  as well as other functions and features such as next generation internet protocol ip  wireless and digital subscriber line connectivity and voice over ip capability 
at the time of the netscreen acquisition  it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eighteen months at an estimated cost of approximately million 
as of december   it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next nine months at an estimated cost of approximately million 
the unisphere acquisition included million of ipr d 
these development efforts were completed as of december  
table of contents integration we incurred integration expenses of approximately million related to the netscreen acquisition and million related to the unisphere acquisition 
integration expenses are incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies 
the integration expenses consisted principally of workforce related expenses for individuals transitioning their positions and professional fees 
other income and expenses the following table shows other income and expenses for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  interest and other income interest expense write down of investments gain loss on redemption of convertible subordinated notes gain on sale of investments equity in net loss of joint venture interest and other income decreased million from to and million from to both decreases were the result of lower rates of return realized from our investments and less realized gains  partially offset by a gain of million during from a non recurring engineering contract 
interest expense decreased million from to and million from to  almost entirely due to interest saved from the retirement of our subordinated notes 
we have certain minority equity investments in privately held companies that are carried at cost  adjusted for any impairment  as we do not have a controlling interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies 
we wrote down these investments by million and million in and  respectively  for changes in market value that we believed were other than temporary 
we spent million  million and million during  and  respectively  to retire our subordinated notes 
we recognized net losses of million and million during and  respectively 
we recognized a gain of million during the losses and gains were a result of the difference between the carrying value of the subordinated notes at the time of their retirement  including unamortized debt costs  and the amount paid to extinguish such notes 
during the first and second quarters of  we sold some of our marketable equity securities classified as available for sale  which had a cost basis of million  and recognized gains of million 
during the second quarter of  we entered into a joint venture agreement with ericsson to develop and market products for the wireless internet infrastructure market 
we recognized our portion of the net loss in this joint venture with ericsson in the amount of million during as of december   we had no further capital funding obligations to this joint venture 

table of contents provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased to million in from million in due to the increase in income before income taxes 
the effective rates were approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to in process research and development expenses related to an acquisition that were not deductible for tax purposes 
the effective tax rate reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions  the benefit of tax credits and the inability to benefit from certain charges and losses 
the effective rate reflects taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions  the benefit of research credits and capital loss carryforwards and the inability to benefit from certain charges and losses 
the internal revenue service irs has concluded an audit of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years and during  we received a notice of proposed adjustment nopa from the irs 
while the final resolution of the issues raised in the nopa is uncertain  we believe we have made adequate provisions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that the irs has proposed with respect to these tax returns 
in conjunction with the irs income tax audit  certain of our us payroll tax returns are currently under examination for fiscal years  and we received a second nopa in the amount of million for employment tax assessments primarily related to the timing of tax deposits related to employee stock option exercises 
we intend to dispute this assessment with the irs and resolve the issue at the appeals level 
we currently do not believe that it is probable that any final assessment will be sustained nor do we believe that a liability can be reasonably estimated at this time 
in the event that this issue is resolved unfavorably  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
liquidity and capital resources overview we have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities 
the following table shows our capital resources in thousands as of december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments restricted cash working capital certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
see note in item for more information 
working capital increased million from to primarily due to cash provided by operations of million 
the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable  reduced by accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next months 
in addition  there are no transactions  arrangements  and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources 

table of contents cash requirements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than more than total year years years years operating leases  net of committed subleases a senior notes b other contractual obligations c total a we occupy approximately million square feet world wide under operating leases 
the majority of our office space is in north america  including our corporate headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
our longest lease expires in may b our principal commitment as of december  was our outstanding zero coupon convertible senior notes due june  senior notes 
the senior notes were issued in june and are senior unsecured obligations  rank on parity in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt  and rank senior to all of our existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes 
the senior notes bear no interest  but are convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to certain conditions  at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by juniper networks 
the conversion rate is shares per each  principal amount of convertible notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
c our other contractual obligations consist primarily of an agreement to purchase a portfolio of patents for million  which was paid in january these patents will be amortized over their useful lives  which average years 
we do not have firm purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers 
in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply  the contract manufacturers place non cancelable  non returnable ncnr orders  which were valued at million as of december   based on our build forecasts 
we do not take ownership of the components and the ncnr orders do not represent firm purchase commitments pursuant to our agreements with the contract manufacturers 
the components are used by the contract manufacturers to build products based on purchase orders we have received from our customers 
we do not incur a liability for products built by the contract manufacturer until it fulfills our customer s order and the order ships 
however  if the components go unused  we may be assessed carrying charges or obsolete charges 
as of december   we had accrued million based on our estimate of such charges

the emerging issues task force issued eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf  during september eitf states that all issued securities that have embedded conversion features that are contingently exercisable upon occurrence of a market price condition should be included in the calculation of diluted eps  regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
the eitf consensus must be applied by retroactive restatement based on the terms in effect and amounts outstanding on the last day of the fiscal period in 
table of contents which the consensus becomes effective 
eitf was effective for us beginning in the fourth quarter of eitf applied to our senior notes that were issued in june the application of eitf reduced the diluted earnings per share by one cent 
we have restated our diluted shares and earnings per share for the year ended december  factors that may affect future results investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies involve significant risks 
the market price of our stock reflects a higher multiple of expected future earning than many other companies 
accordingly  even small changes in investor expectations for our future growth and earnings  whether as a result of our actual financial results  acquisitions  industry changes or other factors  could trigger significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors  including but not limited to the following factors  that could affect our stock price 
we face intense competition that could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our financial results 
competition is intense in the markets that we address 
the ip infrastructure market has historically been dominated by cisco systems  inc  with other companies such as alcatel sa  nortel networks corporation and huawei technologies providing products to a smaller segment of the market 
in addition  a number of other small public or private companies have products or have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our products address 
in the security products market  we face intense competition from a broader group of companies including appliance vendors such as cisco systems  inc  sonicwall  inc  and watchguard technologies and software vendors such as checkpoint software technologies and symantec corporation 
we also compete with various emerging private companies and low cost network hardware suppliers that may position their products as replacements for ours 
if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors on the basis of product offerings or price  we could experience a loss in market share and revenues and or be required to reduce prices  which could reduce our gross margins  and which could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we rely on value added resellers and distribution partners to sell our products  and disruptions to or our failure to effectively develop and manage our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 
our future success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of value added reseller and distribution partners 
the majority of our revenues are derived through value added resellers and distributors  most of which also sell competitors products 
our revenues depend in part on the performance of these distributors and value added resellers 
the loss of or reduction in sales to these value added resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues 
our competitors may in some cases be effective in incentivizing resellers or potential resellers to favor their products or to prevent or reduce sales of our products 
if we fail to maintain relationships with these distribution partners  fail to develop new relationships with value added resellers and distributors in new markets or expand the number of resellers in existing markets  fail to manage  train or incent existing value added resellers and distributors effectively or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer 
in addition  we recognize a substantial portion of our revenue based on a sell through model using information provided by our distributors 
if those distributors provide us with inaccurate or untimely information  the amount or timing of our revenues could be adversely impacted 

table of contents further  in order to develop and expand our distribution channel  we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support it  and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and inherently difficult to manage 
our failure to successfully manage and develop our distribution channel and the processes and procedures that support it could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 
integration of past acquisitions and future acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and stock price and may dilute the ownership of our stockholders 
we have made  and may continue to make  acquisitions in order to enhance our business 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire 
the integration of businesses that we have acquired has been  and will continue to be  a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
for example  although we completed the acquisition of netscreen in april  integration of the products  product roadmap  operations  and personnel is a continuing activity and will be for the foreseeable future 
acquisitions may also require us to issue common stock that dilutes the ownership of our current stockholders  assume liabilities  record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  and incur large and immediate write offs and restructuring and other related expenses  all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  if we fail in our integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices  our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 
a limited number of our customers comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results 
a substantial majority of our net revenues depend on sales to a limited number of customers and distribution partners 
siemens accounted for greater than of our net revenues during and ericsson ab accounted for greater than of our net revenues during and any downturn in the business of these customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers  which could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations 
in addition  there has been and continues to be consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example  the recently announced planned acquisitions of at t and mci by sbc and verizon  respectively 
this consolidation may cause our customers who are involved in these acquisitions to suspend or indefinitely reduce their purchases of our products or have other unforeseen consequences 
we expect gross margin to vary over time and our recent level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 
our recent level of product gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors  including product mix shifts  increased price competition in one or more of the markets in which we compete  increases in material or labor costs  excess inventory or obsolescence charges from our contract manufacturers  increased costs due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if our forecasts do not accurately anticipate product demand  or our introduction of new products or entry into new markets with different pricing and cost structures 

table of contents we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components  which makes us susceptible to shortages or price fluctuations in our supply chain and we may face increased challenges in supply chain management in the future 
with the current demand for electronic products  component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited 
growth in our business and the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and to establish optimal component levels 
if shortages or delays persist  the price of these components may increase  or the components may not be available at all 
we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner and our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed 
we currently purchase numerous key components  including application specific integrated circuits asics  from single or limited sources 
the development of alternate sources for those components is time consuming  difficult and costly 
for example  ibm is our sole asic supplier for our infrastructure products and toshiba america electronic components  inc is our sole asic supplier for our security products 
in addition  the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules 
in the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from these suppliers  we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner 
if  as a result  we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver product to our customers  which would seriously impact present and future sales  which would  in turn  adversely affect our business 
in addition  the development  licensing or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management 
failure to effectively manage the supply of key components and products would adversely affect our business 
if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays which would harm our business 
we provide demand forecasts to our contract manufacturers 
if we overestimate our requirements  the contract manufacturers may assess charges or we may have liabilities for excess inventory  each of which could negatively affect our gross margins 
conversely  because lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and the demand for each component at a given time  if we underestimate our requirements  the contract manufacturers may have inadequate materials and components required to produce our products  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and deferral or loss of revenues 
we are dependent on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have long term supply contracts  and changes to those relationships  expected or unexpected  may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships 
we depend on independent contract manufacturers each of whom is a third party manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products 
although we have contracts with our contract manufacturers  those contracts do not require them to manufacture our products on a long term basis in any specific quantity or at any specific price 
in addition  it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement additional contract manufacturer relationships 
therefore  if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays  disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations  or we had to change or add additional contract manufacturers  our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed 
also  the addition of manufacturing locations or contract manufacturers would increase the complexity of our supply chain management 
for example  one of our contract manufacturers has recently begun manufacturing in malaysia 
each of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial results 
the fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period and a shortfall in revenues may harm our operating results 
our revenues depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete 
economic weakness  customer financial difficulties and constrained spending 
table of contents on network expansion has previously resulted for example  in and  and may in the future result  in decreased revenues and earnings and could also negatively impact our ability to forecast and manage our contract manufacturer relationships 
economic downturns may also lead to restructuring initiatives and associated expenses and impairment of investments 
in addition  our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are  and will continue to be  fixed in the short term 
uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
future economic weakness  customer financial difficulties and reductions in spending on network expansion could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and consequently on our results of operations and stock price 
our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected software or hardware errors  our business could be adversely affected and we might have to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 
our products are highly technical and complex  are critical to the operation of many networks and  in the case of our security products  provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information 
our products have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors  defects or security vulnerabilities 
some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by end customers 
any errors or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition  loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost  any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  we could face claims for product liability  tort or breach of warranty 
defending a lawsuit  regardless of its merit  is costly and may divert management s attention 
in addition  if our business liability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all  our financial condition could be harmed 
if our products do not interoperate with our customers networks  installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business 
our products are designed to interface with our customers existing networks  each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors 
many of our customers networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved 
our products will be required to interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers requirements 
if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers networks  we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware  which could be costly and negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers networks  orders for our products could be cancelled or our products could be returned 
this could hurt our operating results  damage our reputation and seriously harm our business and prospects 
traditional telecommunications companies and other large companies generally require more onerous terms and conditions of their vendors 
as we seek to sell more products to such customers  we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business 
traditional telecommunications companies and other large companies  because of their size  generally have had greater purchasing power and  accordingly  have requested and received more favorable terms  which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors 
as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer  we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions  which may include terms that affect our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
for example  many customers in this class have purchased products from other vendors who promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such functionality and or had products that caused problems and outages in the networks of these customers 
as a result  this class of customers may 
table of contents request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products 
these additional requests and penalties  if we are required to agree to them  may affect our ability to recognize the revenues from such sales  which may negatively affect our business and our financial condition 
if we do not successfully anticipate market needs and develop products and product enhancements that meet those needs  or if those products do not gain market acceptance  we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate the market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements to meet those needs  such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales of our present and future products  which would significantly harm our business and financial results 
even if we are able to anticipate and develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements  there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance 
any failure of our products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect our business and financial results 
our ability to develop  market and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel 
our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of key executive  engineering  sales  marketing and support personnel 
the supply of highly qualified individuals  in particular engineers in very specialized technical areas  is limited and competition for such individuals is intense 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees  the inability to attract or retain key personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers  could delay the development and introduction of new products  and negatively impact our ability to market  sell  or support our products 
recent rulemaking by the financial accounting standards board will require us to expense equity compensation given to our employees and will significantly harm our operating results and may reduce our ability to effectively utilize equity compensation to attract and retain employees 
we historically have used stock options as a significant component of our employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
the financial accounting standards board has adopted changes that will require companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives beginning july  by causing us to incur significantly increased compensation costs  such accounting changes will reduce our reported earnings and will require us to reduce the availability and amount of equity incentives provided to employees  which may make it more difficult for us to attract  retain and motivate key personnel 
each of these results could materially and adversely affect our business 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights may be time consuming  expensive and require a significant amount of resources to prosecute  defend or make our products non infringing 
third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our products 
for example  in  toshiba corporation filed a lawsuit against us  alleging that our products infringe certain toshiba patents 
the asserted claims and or initiated litigation may include claims against us or our manufacturers  suppliers  or customers  alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our products 
regardless of the merit of these claims  they can be time consuming  result in costly litigation and may require us to develop non infringing technologies or enter into license agreements 
furthermore  because of the potential for high awards of damages that are not necessarily predictable  even arguably unmeritorious claims may be settled for significant amounts of money 
if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made 
table of contents against us by any third party is successful  if we are required to settle litigation for significant amounts of money  or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license required proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we are a party to lawsuits  which  if determined adversely to us  could require us to pay damages which could harm our business and financial condition 
we and certain of our current and former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits 
there can be no assurance that actions that have been brought against us or may be brought against us will be resolved in our favor 
regardless of whether they are in our favor  these lawsuits are  and any future lawsuits to which we may become a party will likely be  expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve 
such costs of defense and any losses resulting from these claims could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow 
the long sales and implementation cycles for our products  as well as our expectation that some customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times  may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a customer s decision to purchase certain of our products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process 
as a result  the sales cycle may be lengthy 
throughout the sales cycle  we may spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
even after making the decision to purchase  customers may deploy our products slowly and deliberately 
timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer  the size of the network deployment  the complexity of the customer s network environment and the degree of hardware and software configuration necessary to deploy the products 
customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis 
accordingly  we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis 
these long cycles  as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times  may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
our products incorporate and rely upon licensed third party technology and if licenses of third party technology do not continue to be available to us or become very expensive  our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected 
we integrate licensed third party technology into certain of our products 
from time to time  we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements 
third party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
our inability to maintain or re license any third party licenses required in our products or our inability to obtain third party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements  could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost  any of which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a breach of network security could harm public perception of our security products  which could cause us to lose revenues 
if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in the network of a customer of our security products  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed 
this could cause us to lose current and potential end customers or cause us to lose current and potential value added resellers and distributors 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 

table of contents due to the global nature of our operations  economic or social conditions or changes in a particular country or region could adversely affect our sales or increase our costs and expenses  which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
we conduct significant sales and customer support operations directly and indirectly through our distributors and value added resellers in countries outside of the united states and also depend on the operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers that are located outside of the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including  among others  political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries  service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue  costs  expenses and financial condition 
our success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions 
past restructuring efforts may prove to be inadequate or may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 
our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process to enable us to effectively scale our business and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions 
in periods of market expansion  we have increased investment in our business by  for example increasing headcount and increasing our investment in research and development and other parts of our business 
conversely  during and  in response to downward trending industry and market conditions  we restructured our business and reduced our workforce 
in addition  we expect that we will have to change our facilities in certain locations and we may face difficulties and significant expenses identifying and moving into suitable office space and subleasing or assigning any surplus space 
these changes and other similar actions taken to respond to fluctuating market and economic conditions have placed  and our anticipated future operations will continue to place  significant demands on our management resources 
this may increase the potential likelihood of other risks  and our business may suffer if we fail to effectively manage changes in the size and scope of our operations 
we may not be able to successfully implement the initiatives we have undertaken in restructuring our business in the past and  even if successfully implemented  these initiatives may not be sufficient to meet the changes in industry and market conditions 
furthermore  our workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 
lastly  costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may be higher than the estimated costs of such actions and or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings  all of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results and cash flows 
because a majority of our business is conducted outside the united states  we face exposure to adverse movements in non us currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 
the majority of our revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars 
we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the japanese yen  hong kong dollar  british pound and the euro  related to our sales and service operations outside of the united states 
an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in us dollars  and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

table of contents currently  we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful  our net income could be adversely impacted 
our quarterly results are inherently unpredictable and subject to substantial fluctuations and  as a result  we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
the factors that may affect the unpredictability of our quarterly results include limited visibility into customer spending plans  changing market conditions  including some customer and potential customer bankruptcies  changes in the mix of products sold  long sales and implementation cycles  regional economic and political conditions and seasonality 
for example  many companies experience seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns  particularly in the st and rd quarters 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily a good indication of what our future performance will be 
it is likely that in some future quarters  our operating results may be below one or more of the expectations of securities analysts and investors in which case the price of our common stock may decline 
such a decline could occur  and has occurred in the past  even when we have met our publicly stated revenue and or earnings guidance 
if we fail to adequately evolve our financial and managerial control and reporting systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business will be negatively affected 
our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market depends upon an effective planning and management process 
we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage our business effectively in the future 
if we fail to continue to implement improved systems and processes  our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be negatively affected 
we sell our products to customers that use those products to build networks and ip infrastructure and  if the network and ip systems do not continue to grow  then our business  operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the growth of ip infrastructure and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of ip services 
as a result of changes in the economy and capital spending  which have in the past particularly affected telecommunications service providers  spending on ip infrastructure can vary  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our revenues 
the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls  export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies  especially encryption technology 
in addition  from time to time  governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology  such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys 
governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports  or our failure to obtain required export approval of encryption technologies could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues 

table of contents while we believe that we currently have adequate internal controls over financial reporting  we are exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements 
we expect to incur significant expenses and management resources to section compliance on an ongoing basis 
in the event that our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine in the future that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section  investor perceptions may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 
we are subject to risks arising from our international operations 
we derive a majority of our revenues from our international operations  and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future 
as a result of our international operations  we are affected by economic  regulatory and political conditions in foreign countries  including changes in it spending generally  the imposition of government controls  changes or limitations in trade protection laws  unfavorable changes in tax treaties or laws  natural disasters  labor unrest  earnings expatriation restrictions  misappropriation of intellectual property  acts of terrorism and continued unrest in many regions and other factors  which could have a material impact on our international revenues and operations 
in particular  in some countries we may experience reduced intellectual property protection 
moreover  local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the united states 
in many foreign countries  particularly in those with developing economies  it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or united states regulations applicable to us 
although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies  there can be no assurance that all of our employees  contractors and agents will not take actions in violations of them 
violations of laws or key control policies by our employees  contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems  fines  penalties  prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
regulation of the telecommunications industry could harm our operating results and future prospects 
the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by the changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications industry 
currently  there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on ip networks 
we could be adversely affected by regulation of ip networks and commerce in any country where we operate 
such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using internet protocol  encryption technology  and access charges for service providers 
the adoption of such regulations could decrease demand for our products  and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating result and financial condition 
changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands fair value valuation of securities given an as of valuation of securities given an interest interest rate decrease of x basis points bps december rate increase of x bps bps bps bps  bps bps bps government treasury and agencies corporate bonds and notes asset backed securities and other total these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps  which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts it is our policy to use derivatives to partially offset our market exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
we recognize these derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses  denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen  and british pound 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges  and have maturities between one and two months 
we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy financial institutions 
for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction  is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates 
we record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments  which was immaterial during the years ended december   and  in other income expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income expense on the consolidated statement of operations at that time 
for the years 
table of contents ended december   and  there were no material net gains or losses recognized in other income expense relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur 
additionally  we use foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense 
changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange contracts are largely offset by remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
these foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the foreign exchange contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of december   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
