see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of interstate hotels and resorts  inc and all our consolidated subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates 
the evaluation of impairment of certain long lived assets and intangible assets with determinable lives  the evaluation of impairment of goodwill  estimation of valuation allowances  especially those related to deferred income tax assets and receivables  and revenue recognition 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets which include our intangible assets with determinable useful lives may be impaired  we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the asset 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the asset is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses 
we review long lived assets for impairment when one or more of the following events have occurred current or immediate short term future months projected cash flows are significantly less than the most recent historical cash flows  a significant loss of management contracts without the realistic expectation of a replacement  the unplanned departure of an executive officer or other key personnel  which could adversely affect our ability to maintain our competitive position and manage future growth  a significant adverse change in legal factors or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  which could affect the value of the goodwill or other long lived assets  or events that could cause significant adverse changes and uncertainty in business and leisure travel patterns 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  annually  or as circumstances warrant  we perform an analysis to determine whether the goodwill carrying value has been impaired 
to test goodwill for impairment  we perform an analysis to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we make estimates of the discounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the reporting unit 
if the analysis indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we do an analysis to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses 
aside from testing upon the occurrence of trigger events  we also test goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter 
we did not recognize any impairment losses for goodwill in  or valuation allowances we use our judgment in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at december   we have a valuation allowance of  to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
this is an allowance against some  but not all  of our recorded deferred tax assets 
we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
our estimates of taxable income require us to make assumptions about various factors that affect our operating results  such as economic conditions  consumer demand  competition and other factors 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
based on actual results or a revision in future estimates  we might determine that we would not be able to realize additional portions of our net deferred tax assets in the future  if that occurred  we would record a charge to the income tax provision in that period 
the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards will be limited by the provisions of the internal revenue code 
the valuation allowance we recorded included the effect of the limitations on our deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss carryforwards 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our judgment in determining the ability and willingness of hotel owners to make required payments 
our judgments in determining customer ability and willingness to pay are based on past experience with hotel owners and our assessment of the current and future operating environments for hotel owners 
if a customer s financial condition deteriorates or a management contract is terminated in the future  this could decrease a hotel owner s ability or obligation to make payments 
if that occurred  we might have to make additional allowances  which could reduce our earnings 
revenue recognition we earn revenue from hotel management contracts and related services  corporate housing operations and operations of our wholly owned hotel 
our management and other fees consist of base and incentive management fees received from third party owners of hotel properties and fees for other related services we provide 
through the second quarter of  we had recorded incentive management fees in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and method no 
of eitf topic no 
d  accounting for management fees based on a formula in which incentive management fees are accrued as earned based on the profitability of the hotel  subject to the specific terms of each individual management agreement 
the application of method no 
resulted in the accrual of incentive management fees during interim reporting periods throughout the annual measurement period 
the accrual would be reduced or eliminated in subsequent interim reporting periods if the profitability of the hotel missed performance thresholds later in the annual measurement period 
in the third quarter of  with an effective date of january   we began recording the incentive management fees in the period that it is certain the incentive management fees are earned  which for annual incentive fee measurements is typically in the last month of the annual contract period 
this newly adopted accounting principle is preferable because the new method eliminates the potential that incentive management fee revenue will be recognized in one interim reporting period and reduced or eliminated in a future interim reporting period 
this methodology is designated as method no 
in eitf topic no 
d method no 
is the securities and exchange commission staff s preferred method of accounting for incentive management fees 
bridgestreet recognizes revenue from our corporate housing services in metropolitan markets located in the united states  the united kingdom and paris 
we recognize fees when earned in accordance with the individual leasing contract 
and industry assessment hotel operations have improved significantly in as compared with and through the end of  the sluggish economy  the conflict in iraq  fear of terrorist acts  health concerns for travelers  and delays and difficulties in travel due to heightened security measures at airports had a significant negative impact on our operating results 
in  revpar improved  occupancy rose and average daily rate adr increased  all compared to the same period of the prior year 
these statistics exclude rooms at florida properties that were affected by the recent hurricanes during the third quarter of 
these improvements are primarily attributable to the improvement in the us economy reflecting the increase in the gross domestic product of in we are encouraged by these improvements and expect that our results of operations will improve if these trends continue 
in our corporate housing division during and  the weak economy  the conflict in iraq  traveler health concerns corporate housing due to sars and fears of terrorism also negatively impacted the demand for corporate relocations and long term travel assignments  two primary drivers of our operations 
the months ended demonstrated encouraging improvement compared to months ended  as we continue to focus on stronger markets such as new york  washington  dc  chicago and london 
in addition  we have reduced our inventory in areas where demand is weak or declining  a strategy that resulted in disposal of the toronto market in june  where long term leases did not permit us to adjust our inventory as demand changed 
our goal going forward is to shorten the length of our lease commitments where possible and look for more opportunities to convert higher risk apartment blocks into management arrangements 
the disposal of the toronto operation eliminated a significant drag on our corporate housing operations 
our plans to improve our operations include the following continue to improve the operations of our managed properties which will generate additional base and incentive fees for us 
secure additional management contracts on quality properties 
increase the number of our investments in hotels  resorts and conference centers through the creation of joint ventures and or real estate funds  where we will invest alongside other real estate investors and manage the acquired properties 
the goal of these investments is to enable us to increase our equity in earnings from the profits of these investments  as well as provide revenues from management fees from the associated properties 
improve our inventory management and control costs within our existing markets in our corporate housing segment  increase our focus on high growth markets such as new york  washington  dc  chicago and london and increase our sales efforts in our primary national segments 
we may also add additional markets in north america if the conditions are favorable

in january  we negotiated a transfer of that carrier s current policies to a new carrier 
we are working with the prior carrier to facilitate a timely and efficient close out of the claims outstanding under the prior carrier s casualty policies 
the prior carrier has primary responsibility for settling those claims from its assets 
if the prior carrier s assets are not sufficient to settle these outstanding claims  and the claims exceed amounts available under state guaranty funds  we may be required to settle those claims

we derived approximately and of our revenues excluding reimbursed expenses from managed properties for the years ended december  and  respectively  from services performed in canada  the united kingdom  france  russia  and portugal 
our foreign currency translation gains and losses were for the year ended december   and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our statement of operations 
to date  since most of our foreign operations have been largely self contained or dollar denominated  we have not been exposed to material foreign exchange risk 
therefore  we have not entered into any foreign currency exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in the event that we have large transactions requiring currency conversion we would reevaluate whether we should engage in hedging activities
