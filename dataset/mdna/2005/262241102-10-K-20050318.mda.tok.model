revenues 
we generate revenue primarily from product sales and shipping fees 
in  we reported consolidated total net sales of million  which reflected a million  or  increase over our net sales growth was driven by a increase in our total order volume  to million orders  and  to a lesser extent  a increase in our average net sales per order  to our revenues experienced strong growth in our flagship otc and mail order pharmacy segments  which grew by including wholesale otc and  respectively  over our revenues also benefited from the addition of million in net sales attributable to the acquisition of vision direct and million in net sales attributable to our wholesale otc fulfillment agreement with amazon

assuming that we are able to  among other things  successfully implement our growth strategies relating to our investments in brand development  marketing and technology and manage our expenses  we anticipate total net sales in to be in the range of million to million 
we expect our growth to be primarily driven by our otc and mail order pharmacy segments 

table of contents expenses

marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales declined by basis points to of net sales 
this increased marketing efficiency is reflected in a increase in our trailing month number of active customers and a increase in the average annual spend per active customer for in addition  increased utilization of our primary distribution center reduced our fulfillment expenses to of total net sales in  down from in we also reduced technology expenses to of net sales in  from in  and held general and administrative and other operating expenses relatively flat

significant accounting judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the securities and exchange commission  or sec  has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the significant accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies that involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
additional information about our significant accounting policies is included in note of our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
in addition  any significant unanticipated changes in any of our assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
revenues from sales of mail order pharmacy  otc and vision products delivered to customers net of promotional discounts  cancellations  rebates and returns allowances are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to the customer 
return allowances  which reduce product sales by our estimate of expected product returns  are estimated using historical experience 
if our estimate of return allowances is too high  our revenues will be understated  if our estimate of these allowances is too low  our revenues will be overstated 
historically  product returns  and differences between our estimates and actual returns  have not been significant 

table of contents revenues from sales of prescription products ordered online or by telephone through the drugstore 
com web store or the riteaid 
com web store which is powered by the drugstore 
com web store for pick up at a rite aid store  including co payments received and collected on our behalf by rite aid  are recognized when the customer picks up the product 
in these circumstances  we utilize rite aid as our fulfillment partner 
according to the criteria outlined in emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or eitf  we record revenues in our local pick up pharmacy segment on a gross basis  because we believe we act as a principal  based on the fact that  among other things  we bear both inventory risk and credit and collection risk associated with these sales 
for insured prescriptions in both our local pick up and mail order segments  the co payment and the insurance reimbursement which together make up the amount owed by the customer constitute the full value of the prescription drug sale  and we receive this entire amount as cash 
we therefore recognize the entire amount as revenue when the order is shipped to the customer for mail order prescriptions or picked up by the customer for local pick up prescriptions 
revenues from sales of otc products ordered through the amazon 
com website and fulfilled by drugstore 
com are recognized when the products are shipped from our distribution center 
according to the criteria outlined in eitf  we record fees and revenues generated by the amazon 
com agreement in our otc segment on a gross basis  because we believe we act as a principal  based on the fact that we bear general inventory risk associated with these sales 
periodically  we provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases 
such offers include discounts on specific current purchases  or future rebates based upon a percentage of the current purchase  as well as other offers 
discounts  when accepted by our customers  are treated as a reduction to the sales price of the related transaction and are presented as a net amount in net sales 
rebates are treated as a reduction to sales price based on estimated redemption rates 
redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar offers 
historically  our redemption rates  which are adjusted quarterly  have not differed materially from our estimates 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost using the weighted average cost method or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a reserve for shrinkage and slow moving  damaged and expired inventory  which is recorded as the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on management s assumptions about future demand for the products we offer and market conditions 
we use a variety of methods to reduce the quantity of slow moving inventory  including reducing sales prices on our websites  negotiating returns to vendors  and liquidating inventory through third parties 
if our estimates of future product demand or our assumptions about market conditions are inaccurate  we will understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
historically  the market value of our inventory has not differed materially from our estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangibles  or sfas  we do not amortize goodwill but instead test for impairment at least annually 
we test for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter or whenever indicators of impairment occur 
the first phase of the test screens for impairment 
if impairment is determined  the second phase measures the impairment by comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value 
fair value is determined using either a discounted cash flow methodology or methodology based on comparable market prices 
if our estimates of revenue growth or future cash flows prove to be inaccurate  we may have a future impairment of goodwill 

table of contents the carrying values of our amortized long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  are reviewed whenever an indicator of impairment occurs 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  we perform an evaluation of recoverability 
the determination of whether impairment exists is based on any excess of the carrying value over the expected future cash flows  as estimated through undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges 
we measure any resulting impairment charge based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value  as estimated through expected future discounted cash flows  discounted at a rate of return for an alternate investment 
legal proceedings we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
see note  commitments and contingencies  for a description of our material legal proceedings

as a result  we evaluated the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas and sfas in accordance with sfas  we reviewed the carrying values of our amortized long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets 
the determination of whether impairment exists is based on any excess of the carrying value over the expected future cash flows  as estimated through undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges 
any resulting impairment charge is measured based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value  as estimated through expected future discounted cash flows  discounted at a rate of return for an alternate investment 
in accordance with sfas  we evaluated our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets by performing an impairment analysis 
under the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis  we determined the fair value of the vision segment using a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value based on comparable market prices 
based on the first step analysis  we determined that the carrying amount of our vision segment was in excess of its fair value 
therefore  we were required to perform the second step analysis on the vision segment to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
we had not completed the second step analysis by the filing date of our quarterly report on form q for the third quarter of because of the complexities involved in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill of the vision segment  but we had determined that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated at that time 
as a result of our analysis under sfas and  we recorded for the third quarter of impairment charges of million and million to reduce the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we finalized our impairment review and reduced our impairment charge related to goodwill by million and increased our impairment charge related to other definite lived intangible assets by million  resulting in a final impairment charge for of million to goodwill and million to other intangible assets million to indefinite lived and million to definite lived 
no impairment or restructuring charges were incurred in the impairment charge in related to the write off of prepaid cable television advertising rights

com and recorded an million impairment charge as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter of income taxes fiscal year change fiscal year change fiscal year in thousands income tax benefit in  we recorded an income tax benefit that resulted from the impairment of certain indefinite lived intangible assets and related reduction in deferred tax liabilities that were recorded in connection with our acquisition of vision direct 
in and  there was no provision or benefit for income taxes due to our ongoing operating losses 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  or eitf  which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments 
additionally  eitf includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the effectiveness of the accounting provisions of eitf  however  the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been adopted for our fiscal year we believe the accounting provisions of eitf will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued fas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or fas fas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
fas r applies to all stock based compensation transactions in which a company acquires services by a issuing its stock or other equity instruments  except through arrangements resulting from employee stock ownership plans  or b incurring liabilities that are based on the company s stock price 
fas r requires all 
table of contents share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as an expense in a company s financial statements based on their fair values at the date of grant 
fas r is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june   and we will adopt it effective for the third quarter of fas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
we are currently evaluating these methods and have not yet determined which method we will adopt 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under apb as a result  we recognize no compensation expense for employee stock options  except for options granted with an exercise price lower than the market price on the date of grant 
the adoption of fas r s fair value method will require us to recognize compensation expense for employee stock options and other share based payments to employees  based on their fair market value on the date of grant 
this will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the magnitude of the impact of adopting fas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of fas as described in the disclosure of adjusted net loss and loss per share included in the section entitled stock based compensation in note of our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
fas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce our net operating cash flows and increase our net financing cash flows in periods after the adoption 
we cannot estimate what the impact on our statement of cash flows will be in the future because it depends on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
to date  however  we have not recognized any operating cash flows for such excess tax deductions 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred net losses of million since inception 
we believe that we will continue to incur net losses for at least the next year  and possibly longer 
from our inception through january   we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  including common and preferred stock  yielding net cash proceeds of million

our marketable securities  which include commercial paper  auction rate securities  corporate notes and government bonds  are considered short term as they are available to fund current operations 
liquidity sources  requirements and contractual cash requirements and commitments our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
historically  our principal liquidity requirements have been to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
in december  we secured additional funding from silicon valley bank  or svb  through a million term loan for capital equipment expenditures and a revolving line of credit allowing for borrowings up to million through june  and an additional million of borrowings thereafter  based on certain conditions as defined in the agreement 
the term loan accrues interest on the outstanding principal balance at a fixed rate of and is payable in equal monthly installments of principal  plus accrued interest  beginning on february  and ending on january  as of january   million was outstanding under the term loan and there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
the line of credit and term loan are collateralized by our equipment  inventory  and intangible assets

in addition  we have issued two standby letters of credit  in an aggregate amount of approximately million  which were required as security deposits in connection with our new corporate headquarters see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
to date no portion of either letter of credit has been utilized  and we do not anticipate that either letter of credit will be drawn upon by our new landlord 
our primary source of cash is sales made through our websites  for which we collect cash from credit card settlements or insurance reimbursements 
our primary uses of cash are purchases of inventory  salaries  marketing expenses  and overhead and fixed costs 
any projections of our future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty for the reasons discussed in this section and the section entitled additional factors that may affect our business and future results in part i  item of this annual report 
we anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements for will be million to million for various hardware and software additions in technology and additions and upgrades to our distribution centers 
we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures until we begin generating positive operating cash flow 
however  we may need to raise additional funds for strategic flexibility or if  for example  we pursue business or technology acquisitions 
we have in the past and will continue to assess opportunities for raising additional funds by selling equity  equity related or debt securities  obtaining additional credit facilities or obtaining other means of financing for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms when required  or at all 
furthermore  if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of securities  such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience additional dilution 
management outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year  we are targeting net sales in the range of million to million 
we anticipate a net loss for the first quarter in the range of million to million 
for fiscal year  we are targeting net sales in the range of million to million  with expected otc net sales growth of to  and mail order pharmacy net sales growth of to 
we expect lesser growth rates from our vision and local pick up pharmacy segments  with net sales growth of to anticipated for vision and relatively flat net sales anticipated for local pick up pharmacy 
we anticipate a net loss for the year in the range of million to million 
the net loss ranges provided do not reflect the impact of implementing fas r  which will be effective july  during the year we will update our guidance as necessary to reflect the impact of adopting fas r  which we will adopt effective for the third quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have assessed our vulnerability to certain market risks  including interest rate risk associated with financial instruments included in cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  term loan and capital lease obligations 
due to the short term nature of these investments and our investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments is not material to us
