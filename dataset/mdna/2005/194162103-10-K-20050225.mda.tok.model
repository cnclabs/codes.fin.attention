as part of the restructuring program  the company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain through the rationalization of approximately one third of its manufacturing facilities and the closure of certain warehousing facilities and also plans to centralize its purchasing and other business support functions 
business building initiatives include enhancing and reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales  marketing and new product organizations in high potential developing and other key markets  and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets 
the restructuring program is expected to result in approximately a reduction in employees over the next four years

the estimated cost in is aftertax 
savings are projected to be in the range of aftertax annually by the fourth year of the program 
the projected savings in are estimated at approximately aftertax

the company s working capital as a percentage of sales increased to of sales in as compared with of sales in primarily due to the accrued taxes in payable on the sale of non core brands 
the company defines working capital as the difference between current assets excluding cash and marketable securities  the latter of which is reported in other current assets and current liabilities excluding short term debt

the esop notes guaranteed by the company and certain credit facilities contain cross default provisions 
noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed 
the company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote 
the company repurchases common shares in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill the requirements of its compensation and benefit plans 
in october  the board of directors authorized the company to purchase up to million shares of the company s common stock through december  the program

accordingly  management expects that in the projected cash costs of associated with the program will have a negative impact on operating cash flow 
the company has additional sources of liquidity available in the form of lines of credit maintained with various banks and access to financial markets worldwide 
accordingly  the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its financing needs 
at december   the company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of approximately  and also had of medium term notes available for issuance pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement

these purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify minimum quantity  price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases 

table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts long term liabilities associated with the company s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of their cash flows 
the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements  various economic assumptions the most significant of which are detailed in critical accounting policies and use of estimates below and voluntary company contributions 
based on current information  the company is not required to make any mandatory contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan until management s best estimate of cash requirements to be paid directly from the company s assets for its postretirement plans for the year ending december  is  including of expected contributions to the company s postretirement plans 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is party to various superfund and other environmental matters in connection with prior acquisitions 
substantially all of these liabilities have been acknowledged in writing as being covered by the company s insurance carriers which are presently making all their required payments directly to the cleanup efforts and are expected to do so in the future 
the company is also contingently liable with respect to lawsuits  taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
while it is possible that the company s cash flows and results of operations in a particular period could be affected by the one time impact of the resolution of such contingencies  it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters  to the extent not previously provided for  will not have a material impact on the financial position  results of operations or ongoing cash flows of the company 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities 
managing foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price exposure the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity price fluctuations 
volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques  including working capital management  selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into certain derivative instrument transactions in accordance with the company s treasury and risk management policies 
the company s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes 
with operations in over countries and territories  the company is exposed to currency fluctuation related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar 
the major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in the european union and certain latin american countries  although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the us dollar 
the company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in these markets and has been able to substantially offset the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through a combination of cost containment measures  selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs 
the company primarily utilizes currency forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business 
from time to time  the company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency purchases using forward contracts with durations no greater than months 
interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the company s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility 

table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production 
futures contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases 
the results of the company s commodity hedging activities are not material 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the company  however  nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the company s policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long term debt rating of aa aa or higher 
value at risk the company s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows  market value and sensitivity analysis 
however  the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
market exposures are evaluated using a value at risk var model and an earnings at risk ear model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments  assuming adverse market conditions occur  given a confidence level 
historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments  calculated using the var model  is not material to the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company in and the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments  calculated utilizing the ear model  is not material to the company s results of operations in and actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets

management is currently evaluating recent tax law changes under the ajca that create a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain qualifying dividends 
currently  uncertainty remains as to how to interpret certain provisions under the ajca 
as such  the company has not concluded its analysis to determine whether  and to what extent  it might repatriate foreign earnings 
based on the analysis to date  however  it is possible that the company may repatriate approximately under the provisions of the ajca 
while substantial uncertainty remains  the company has presently estimated that the associated tax cost of this amount could range from to the company expects to be in a position to finalize the assessment within a reasonable amount of time after the issuance of clarifying us treasury or congressional guidance 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates 
the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed 
actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management 
the company s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 
in certain instances  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods 
the company s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options  shipping and handling costs  and inventories 
at december   two alternative methods for accounting for stock options were available  the intrinsic value method and the fair value method 
the company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  and accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized 
under the fair value method  the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option term until exercise and future stock price volatility 
if the fair value method were used  diluted earnings per share for  and would have decreased approximately 
as noted above  effective july   sfas r will require all companies issuing stock options to implement the fair value method and recognize compensation expense for stock options granted 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company reports such costs  primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight  in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  the company s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales 
if such costs had been included in cost of sales  gross profit margin as a percent to sales would have decreased from to in with no impact on reported earnings 
the company accounts for inventories using both the first in  first out fifo method of inventories and the last in  first out lifo method of inventories 
there would have been no impact on reported earnings for  and had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method 

table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits  asset impairment  tax valuation allowances  and legal and other contingencies 
in pension accounting  the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate for domestic plans was  and as of december   and  respectively 
as required  the discount rate is based upon published year end rates on high quality bonds 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for domestic plans was as of december   and in determining the long term rate of return  the company considers the nature of the plans investments  an expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rates of return 
a change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate on plan assets would impact net income by approximately a third assumption is the long term rate of compensation increase  a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long term rate of return 
this rate was  and as of december   and  respectively 
the most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate 
in  the assumed rate of increase was for and declining per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of per year 
the effect of a increase in the assumed long term medical cost trend rate would reduce net income by approximately asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows  growth rates and the selection of a discount rate 
since the estimated fair value of the company s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value  significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets 
asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the restructuring program requires management s best estimate of net realizable value 
tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards  to net realizable value 
factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction  carryforward periods  income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income 
a significant change to the company s valuation allowances would primarily impact equity and would not materially impact reported earnings

such assessments are reviewed each period and revised  based on current facts and circumstances  if necessary 
while it is possible that the company s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be affected by the one time impacts of the resolution of such contingencies  it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters  to the extent not previously provided for  will not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or ongoing cash flows

these gains were driven by increased advertising and promotional support in key categories and markets  in line with the company s strategy to invest in its higher margin businesses 
at the same time  however  raw and packing material costs increased 
the combined increase in these costs and the higher advertising and promotional spending more than offset savings generated during the year by the company s ongoing global cost reduction programs 
as a result  operating profit for the year declined  which included a charge in connection with the four year restructuring and business building plan the company began implementing in december the restructuring program is designed to enhance the company s global leadership position in its core businesses

in addition  changes in economic conditions  movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in us dollars 
in particular  economic and political uncertainty in some countries in latin america and changes in the value of latin american and european currencies may impact the overall results of these regions

table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts competition 
the company faces vigorous competition from multinational consumer product companies throughout the world with the same or greater resources than the company 
such competition is based on pricing of products  promotional activities  advertising  new product introductions  electronic commerce initiatives and other activities of competitors  the timing and scale of which cannot be foreseen by the company 
the company s ability to compete also depends on the strength of its brands  its ability to attract and retain key talent  and its ability to protect its patent  trademark and trade dress rights and to defend against related challenges brought by competitors 
retail trade 
the company can be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers  such as inventory de stocking  limitations on access to shelf space  electronic data transmission requirements and other conditions 
with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation  especially in developed markets such as the us and europe  the company is increasingly dependent on key retailers  and these retailers  including large format retailers  have increasingly greater bargaining strength and are reducing their inventory levels 
in addition  private label brands sold by retail trade chains are a source of competition for certain product lines of the company 
products 
the company s growth depends on the successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions  which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors  as well as the continued success of existing products 
in addition  the company s ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by its ability to develop technological innovations  to receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection  to obtain governmental approvals and registrations of regulated products  to comply with fda and other governmental regulations and to anticipate successfully consumer needs and preferences 
cost pressures 
the company s ability to manage its cost structure can be adversely affected by movements in commodity and other raw material prices such as those experienced during  and by unanticipated delays or difficulties in achieving cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution 
in addition  the company s move to global suppliers  to achieve cost reductions and simplify its business  has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers 
for certain materials  new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry and government standards  which can require additional investment and take some period of time 
restructuring program 
in december  the company commenced the restructuring program  a four year restructuring and business building program to enhance the company s global leadership position in its core businesses 
this program presents significant organizational challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties  including labor organizations 
there can be no assurance that the restructuring program will be completed in accordance with the planned timetable  that the actual charges incurred will not exceed the estimated charges or that the full extent of the expected savings will be realized 
manufacturing 
as a company engaged in manufacturing on a global scale  the company is subject to the risks inherent in such activities  including industrial accidents  environmental events  strikes and other labor disputes  disruptions in logistics  loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites  product quality  safety  licensing requirements and other regulatory issues  as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which the company has no control 
acquisitions 
from time to time the company makes strategic acquisitions  such as the june acquisition of gaba 
acquisitions have inherent risks  such as obtaining necessary regulatory approvals  retaining key personnel  integration of the acquired business  and achievement of planned synergies and projections
