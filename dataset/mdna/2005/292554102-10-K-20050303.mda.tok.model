item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business and financial results improved significantly during the year ended december  as compared to prior years 
highlights for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  are as follows gross collections increased to million revenues increased to million net income increased to million we attribute these improvements to stronger collections  especially of seasoned portfolios  disciplined purchasing and our multiple collection strategies 
we believe that the markets for unsecured charged off consumer debt are becoming more competitive 
this has increased and  we believe  will continue to increase the pricing of portfolios 
we are continuing to diversify our acquisition of portfolios into other categories that are somewhat less competitive 
we have significantly improved our financial position as a result of our recent operating performance and our successful follow on public offering of million shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter of our stockholders equity was million as of december   an increase of million from the million in stockholders equity as of december  moreover  our improved operating cash flow combined with the net proceeds of million from our follow on public offering resulted in an unrestricted cash balance of million dollars as of december  and have allowed us to repay significant amounts of principal on our debt facilities during the past three years 
we repaid million  million and million in principal during the years ended december   and  respectively 
our strong financial condition and sound operating performance have also allowed us to obtain a new million revolving credit facility 
unlike our previous facility  the new revolving credit facility does not require us to share with the lender the residual collections on the portfolios financed 
in addition  this facility carries a lower base rate of interest 
accordingly  as we replace borrowings under our old facility with our new facility  our interest costs should decline 
purchasing market outlook in general  the increased competition in the purchase market results in an increasing number of deals at prices which are reducing the profitability of our business 
this is a complicated business and success only begins by purchasing portfolios at the right price 
it also requires collecting well at a reasonable expense ratio 
recently  our industry has attracted a large amount of investment capital 
with this inflow of capital  we have seen a significant increase in the pricing of portfolios to levels that we believe will generate marginally acceptable returns on investment 
as an example  despite bidding significantly more for an annual forward flow arrangement that we had maintained for several years  we were out bid for the contract and have been replacing this contract with individual porfolio purchases 
we expect that over time  many recent entrants to the market  whose business model may be based on less than a multi disciplined approach to purchasing and collecting  will not generate the returns they anticipated 
this may then reduce their ability to access capital and potentially may require them to sell their remaining portfolios and exit the market 
if and when this occurs  we believe that prices should return to justifiable levels 
we believe that our multi disciplined approach to purchasing places us in a strategically advantageous position to capitalize on such an event 
results of operations results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows in thousands  except percentages revenues revenue from receivables portfolios   revenue from retained interest   servicing fees and related revenue  total revenues    operating expenses salaries and employee benefits   other operating expenses    cost of legal collections   collection agency commissions  general and administrative expenses   provision for portfolio losses  depreciation and amortization   total operating expenses   income before interest  other income  and income taxes   interest expense  other income  income before income taxes   provision for benefit from income taxes  net income    year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue total revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to total revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily the result of increased receivables portfolios purchases and increased gross collections during the year 
during the year ended december   we invested million for portfolios with face values aggregating billion for an average purchase price of of face value 
this is a million  or increase compared with the million invested during the year ended december  to acquire portfolios with a face value aggregating billion for an average purchase price of of face value 
gross collections on our investment in receivable portfolios increased million  or to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the weighted average annualized effective interest rate on our accrual basis portfolios was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the revenue as a percentage of collections for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  for additional information on revenue see the supplemental performance data 
operating expenses total operating expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to total operating expenses of million for the year ended december  salaries and employee benefits total salaries and benefits increased by million or to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase was the result of a million or increase in salaries  wages and payroll taxes reflecting an increase in the number of our employees  a million or increase in incentive compensation resulting from our strong operating performance  and million or increase in healthcare costs as a result of increased health benefits provided to our employees  rising healthcare costs and an increase in the number of employees participating in our health plan 
total salaries and benefits as a percentage of gross collections during the year ended december  were compared to for the year ended december  other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase during the year ended december  reflects volume driven increases in the cost of direct mail campaigns and in skip tracing costs 
the cost of direct mail campaigns increased or million to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  skip tracing  credit reporting and scoring costs increased million  or to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  cost of legal collections the cost of legal collections increased million  or to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  these costs represent contingent fees paid to our nationwide network of attorneys and costs of litigation 
the increase in the cost of legal collections was primarily the result of a million  or increase in gross collections through our legal channel which amounted to million during the year ended december  from million collected during the year ended december  cost of legal collections decreased slightly as a percent of gross collections through this channel to during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  the provision for uncollectible deferred court costs increased by million to million during the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year s same period 
the provision is included in the costs of legal collections 
collection agency commissions during the year ended december  we paid million in commissions to third party collection agencies on related gross collections amounting to million 
these expenses relate to our new channel to outsource collections to third party collection agencies 
we did not pay commissions to third party collection agencies during the year ended december  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase is a result of the increased costs of corporate compliance composed primarily of the cost of the implementation of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the costs associated with a registration statement filed on form s on behalf of certain selling stockholders 
the cost of corporate compliance and the registration statement amounted to approximately million  and represented of the year over year increase in general and administrative expenses 
the remaining increase is composed of increases in insurance  rent  and costs associated with the growth in our business 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense remained consistent at million during the years ended december  and interest expense interest expense increased million  or to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the following table summarizes our interest expense in thousands for the years ended december  change change stated interest on debt obligations   amortization of loan fees and other loan costs  contingent interest    total interest expense    average outstanding loan balance for the period   weighted average effective interest rate the weighted average effective interest rate is interest expense applied to the weighted average outstanding balance on all debt during the period and annualized based on a simple interest method 
the calculation of this rate also includes contingent interest expense associated with loans whose principal has been repaid 
the increase in interest expense is due to an increase in contingent interest recorded under the terms of our secured financing facility 
under the terms of our secured financing facility  once we repay the lender for the notes associated with each purchased portfolio and collect sufficient amounts to recoup our initial cash investment in each purchased portfolio  then we share the residual collections contingent interest from the receivables portfolios  net of our servicing fees  with the lender 
we make estimates with respect to the timing and amount of collections of future cash flows from these receivables portfolios 
based on these estimates  we record a portion of the estimated future profit sharing obligation as contingent interest expense see note to the consolidated financial statements 
since the inception of the secured financing facility  we have borrowed million under the facility  representing million in receivable portfolio purchases 
as of december   million remained outstanding 
borrowings during the fourth quarter of amounted to million  million of which were financed under an amendment to the secured financing facility entered into during the quarter 
the newly amended agreement caps the total amount of interest owed to the lender for most portfolios purchased from october  until the expiration of the facility  which was december  the sharing in residual cash flows and the recordation of contingent interest expense will continue for the entire economic life of the receivable portfolios financed using this facility  and will extend substantially beyond the expiration date of the secured financing facility 
new advances for portfolio purchases under the secured financing facility are not available beyond the december  expiration date 
the company was required to give the lender the opportunity to fund all of its purchases of charged off credit card receivables with advances on the secured financing facility through december  the future financing of portfolio purchases will utilize our revolving credit facility  which does not require the sharing of residual collections with the lender see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other income and expense during the year ended december  total other income was million  compared to million during the year ended december  during the first quarter of  we recorded a pretax net gain of million in other income related to a litigation settlement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million  which is an effective rate of of pretax income 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million  which is an effective rate of of pretax income 
the increase in our effective tax rate was the result of increases in federal and state taxes applicable to us as a result of higher taxable income and the changing mix of state taxability and related apportionment factors see note to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue total revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to total revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily the result of increased receivable portfolio purchases and increased gross collections during the year 
during the year ended december   we invested million for portfolios with face values aggregating billion for an average purchase price of of face value 
this is a million  or increase compared with the million invested during the year ended december  to acquire portfolios with a face value aggregating billion for an average purchase price of of face value 
gross collections on our investment in receivable portfolios increased million  or to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the weighted average annualized effective interest rate on our accrual basis portfolios was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the revenue as a percentage of collections for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  for additional information on revenue see the supplemental performance data 
operating expenses total operating expenses were million for the year ended december  an increase of million  or compared to total operating expenses of million for the year ended december  salaries and employee benefits total salaries and benefits increased by million or to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase is the result of a million or increase in salaries  wages and payroll taxes reflecting the increase in the number of our employees  and a million  or increase in healthcare costs as a result of increased health benefits provided to our employees  rising healthcare costs and an increase in the number of employees participating in our health plan  offset by a million or decrease in incentive compensation expense 
also included in salaries and benefits for the year ended december  is a million settlement paid to a former executive officer 
total salaries and benefits as a percentage of gross collections during the year ended december  were compared to for the year ended december  other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase during the year ended december  reflects volume driven increases in the cost of direct mail campaigns and in skip tracing costs

the provision is included in the costs of legal collections 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or to million during the year ended december  we were able to maintain consistent general and administrative expenses despite the increase in gross collections during the year 
provision for portfolio losses we recorded a provision for portfolio losses of million in the year ended december  related to the impairment of certain receivables portfolios 
we did not record a provision for portfolio losses during the year ended december  depreciation and amortization depreciation expense decreased million  or to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease was due to limited expenditures for capital items in years prior to we purchased million and million in capital items during the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense interest expense increased million  or to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the following table summarizes our interest expense in thousands for the years ended december  change change stated interest on debt obligations    amortization of loan fees and other loan costs  contingent interest    total interest expense    average outstanding loan balance for the period   weighted average effective interest rate the weighted average effective interest rate is interest expense applied to the weighted average outstanding balance on all debt during the period and annualized based on a simple interest method 
the calculation of this rate also includes contingent interest expense associated with loans whose principal has been repaid 
the increase in interest expense is due to an increase in contingent interest recorded under the terms of our secord financing facility  offset by the reduction in interest related to the full repayment of four debt facilities whose principal balances totaled million as of december  during the year ended december  other income and expense during the year ended december  total other income was million  compared to million during the year ended december  during the first quarter of  we recorded a pretax net gain of million in other income related to a litigation settlement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million  which is an effective rate of of pretax income 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million  reflecting an effective benefit of of pretax income 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the utilization of net operating losses and other deferred tax assets was more likely than not  and therefore removed all but million of the valuation allowance 
the change in the valuation allowance resulted in the recognition of a current tax benefit in the amount of million in the fourth quarter of this current tax benefit combined with a deferred tax expense  resulted in a net deferred tax benefit of million for the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements

this rate represents the monthly internal rate of return  which has been annualized utilizing the simple interest method 
the monthly internal rate of return is derived from the timing and amounts of actual cash received and the anticipated future cash flow projections for each pool

analysis of changes in revenue the following table analyzes the components of the increase in revenue from our receivable portfolios between the years ended december   and in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  revenue variance component change variance average portfolio balance     weighted average effective interest rate zero basis portfolios  total variance  for the years ended december  revenue variance component change variance average portfolio balance     weighted average effective interest rate zero basis portfolios  total variance  revenue trends accretion revenue recognized is a composite number based on the actual to date and the future expected performance of each portfolio 
collections are allocated between revenue recognized and cost amortized for each portfolio 
thus  if a portfolio has a revenue recognition rate  of the collections are being reported as revenue and of the collections are reflected as amortization reduction of the cost basis of the portfolios 
for revenue recognition purposes  portfolios can be divided into two groups accrual basis portfolios those that still have a remaining unamortized basis  and zero basis portfolios those portfolios for which the cost basis has been completely amortized 
we have zero basis portfolios  for which each dollar of gross collections from these portfolios is recorded entirely as revenue 
the revenue from these portfolios is expected to decline in future quarters as collections from these portfolios diminish 
however  we expect that this decline will be offset by an increase in our internal rate of return on portoflios as described in the following table

our primary cash requirements have included the purchase of receivable portfolios  operational expenses  the payment of interest and the repayment of principal on bank borrowings  and tax payments 
our strong operating performance combined with our equity offerings have resulted in an increase in stockholders equity to million as of december  from million as of december   and million as of december  in addition  our strong operating performance combined with our equity offerings have resulted in our unresticted cash balance growing to million as of december  from million as of december   and million as of december  the following table summarizes our cash flows by category for the periods presented in thousands for the years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities   includes net cash proceeds of million related to a litigation settlement

new advances for the purchase of portfolios under this facility are no longer available  however contingent interest payments related to our residual sharing arrangement with the lender will extend into the future see note to the consolidated financial statements 
all of our portfolio purchases will now be financed under our million revolving credit facility  which had million in availability as of december  unlike our secured financing facility  the new revolving credit facility does not require us to share with the lender the residual collections on the portfolios financed 
operating cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the annual growth in operating cash flow has been driven by our increase in gross collections 
gross collections for the year ended december  grew million  or to million from million for the year ended december  gross collections for the year ended december  grew million  or to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in gross collections was offset by increases in cash based expenses as a result of our growth  increases in the payment of interest  and the resumption of the payment of federal and state income taxes 
operating cash flows during the year ended december  also reflect the net proceeds of million related to a one time litigation settlement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in and  we were able to fully or partially offset our tax liabilities by utilizing net operating loss carry forwards generated in prior years 
during  we fully utilized our federal net operating loss carry forwards 
in and  we utilized our state net operating loss carry forwards with the exception of a california state imposed deferment of our million loss carry forward 
during  we paid federal and state income taxes at the statutory rates 
therefore during the year ended december  and for the first time since  we made substantial tax payments 
these payments totaled million representing an increase of million over tax payments of million paid during the year ended december  total cash basis operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increases year to year are primarily volume related  driven by the and increase in gross collections for the years ended december  and  respectively

repayments under our revolving credit facility are also predicated on our cash collections from the underlying secured receivables portfolios 
the table reflects the repayment of the loans under these facilities based upon our expected cash collections  which reflects repayments earlier than the required due dates 
this table does not include future interest or future contingent interest payments 
for additional information on our debt  lease commitments  and other commitments see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
we are in compliance with all covenants under our financing arrangements  and we have achieved twelve consecutive quarters of positive net income 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity  given our expectation of continued positive cash flows from operations  our cash and cash equivalents of million as of december   and million in availability as of december  under our revolving credit facility  to fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arranagements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by regulation s k a 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the three years ended december   and since inflation rates have generally remained at relatively low levels 
critical accounting policies investment in receivable portfolios 
we account for our investment in receivables portfolios on the accrual basis or cost recovery method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of the aicpa s practice bulletin  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans 
static pools are established with accounts having similar attributes  based on the specific seller and timing of acquisition 
once a static pool is established  the receivables are permanently assigned to the pool 
the discount ie  the difference between the cost of each static pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance is not recorded because the company expects to collect a relatively small percentage of each static pool s contractual receivable balance 
as a result  receivable portfolios are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition 
we account for each static pool as a unit for the economic life of the pool similar to one loan for recognition of revenue from receivables portfolios  for collections applied to principal of receivables portfolios and for provision for loss or impairment 
revenue from receivables portfolios is accrued based on the effective interest rate determined for each pool applied to each pool s original cost basis 
each pool s cost basis is increased for revenue earned and decreased for collections and impairments 
the effective interest rate is the internal rate of return determined based on the timing and amounts of actual cash received and anticipated future cash flow projections for each pool 
we monitor and evaluate actual and projected cash flows for each receivable portfolio on a quarterly basis 
through september   we had not increased the total estimated cash flows for any receivable portfolio 
as a result  for those portfolios whose actual cumulative collections exceeded the forecast  such excess amounts were subtracted from the future estimated collections in order to maintain the original forecast 
however  effective october   we implemented new collection forecasts utilizing a newly developed forecasting model  the unified collection score ucs that considers known data about our customers accounts  including  among other things  our collection experience  and changes in external customer factors  in addition to all data known when we acquired the accounts 
the effect of our change in estimated projected collections resulting from the implementation of the ucs model is discussed at note in the consolidated financial statements 
at the conclusion of our quarterly evaluation  if the revised forecasted cash flows are in excess of the forecasted cash flows prior to evaluation  the effective interest rate is increased prospectively 
if the revised forecasted cash flows are less than the forecasted cash flows prior to evaluation  the effective interest rate is reduced prospectively 
if the revised forecasted cash flows are less than the remaining carrying value  the receivable portfolio is impaired and all of the remaining collections are subsequently applied against book value 
an impairment charge is taken for the difference between the carrying value and the remaining revised forecasted cash flow amount 
additionally  if the amount and timing of future cash collections are not reasonably estimable  we account for these portfolios on the cost recovery method cost recovery portfolios 
no revenue is accreted on cost recovery portfolios  all collections are first applied completely to recover the remaining cost basis of the portfolio and thereafter  if any  are recognized as revenue 
collections realized after the net book value of a portfolio has been fully recovered zero basis portfolios are recorded as revenue zero basis revenue 
contingent interest 
under the terms of the our secured financing facility  once we repay the lender for the notes for each purchased portfolio and collect sufficient amounts to recoup its initial cash investment in each purchased portfolio  then we share the residual collections contingent interest from the receivables portfolios  net of its servicing fees  with the lender 
we make estimates with respect to the timing and amount of collections of future cash flows from these receivables portfolios 
based on these estimates  we record a portion of the estimated future profit sharing obligation as contingent interest expense see note to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred court costs 
we contract with a nationwide network of attorneys that specialize in collection matters 
we generally refer charged off accounts to our contracted attorneys when we believe the related debtor has sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness and has to date been unwilling to pay 
in connection with our agreements with our contracted attorneys  we advance certain out of pocket court costs deferred court costs 
we capitalize these costs in our consolidated financial statements and provide a reserve for those costs that we believe will be ultimately uncollectible 
we determine the reserve based on our analysis of court costs that have been advanced  recovered  and that we anticipate recovering 
income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we utilize estimates in the calculation of our current federal and state income tax liabilities 
in our industry  such estimates are subject to substantial interpretation 
to the extent federal and state taxing authorities successfully challenge our estimates  we may be required to accelerate the recognition of our revenues or decelerate the recognition of certain expenses for income tax reporting purposes 
as a result  we may be required to pay income taxes in periods earlier than we currently expect 
revisions to the estimates would not generally result in a material change in the income tax expense we record in our consolidated financial statements 
instead  it would increase or decrease the amount of taxes we currently are required to pay  which would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the net deferred asset we have reflected in our consolidated statement of financial condition 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for certain debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities loans acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
this sop limits the yield that may be accreted accretable yield to the excess of the investor s estimate of undiscounted expected principal  interest  and other cash flows cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected over the investor s initial investment in the loan 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally would be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life 
decreases in cash flows expected to be collected would be recognized as an impairment on the statement of operations and a corresponding valuation allowance would be created against the investment in receivable portfolios on the statement of financial condition 
sop is effective in fiscal years beginning after december   and accordingly  we will adopt the provisions of this sop in the first quarter of we do not believe that the implementation of sop will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r share based payment  which is a revision of sfas sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   and accordingly  we expect to adopt the provisions of this pronouncement in the third quarter of for periods prior to implementation  we have retained our accounting for stock based employee compensation under apb no 
and have only adopted the pro forma disclosure requirements of sfas no 
we expect that the adoption of this statement will reduce our reported net income and earnings per share 
the effect of adopting this statement on our historical consolidated statements of operations is reflected on a proforma basis in the stock based compensation section contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
special note on forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
all statements  other than statements of historical facts  included or incorporated into this form k are forward looking statements 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  project  and similar expressions often characterize forward looking statements 
these statements may include  but are not limited to  projections of collections  revenues  income or loss  estimates of capital expenditures  plans for future operations  products or services  and financing needs or plans  as well as assumptions relating to these matters 
these statements include  among others  statements found under risk factors  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business 
actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
factors that could affect our results and cause them to differ from those contained in the forward looking statements include our ability to purchase receivables portfolios on acceptable terms  the availability and cost of financing  our ability to recover sufficient amounts on receivables to fund operations  our continued servicing of receivables in our third party financing transactions  our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel to recover on our receivables efficiently  changes in  or failure to comply with  government regulations  and the costs  uncertainties and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date the statement was made 
they are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which we cannot predict or quantify 
future events and actual results could differ materially from the forward looking statements 
when considering each forward looking statement  you should keep in mind the risk factors and cautionary statements found throughout this prospectus and specifically those found above 
we are not obligated to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or for any other reason 
in addition  it is our policy generally not to make any specific projections as to future earnings  and we do not endorse projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties 
supplemental financial information the following table is a reconciliation of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap income before taxes  net income and fully diluted earnings per share to income before taxes  net income and fully diluted earnings per share  excluding one time benefits and other charges for the years presented 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide useful information to investors about our results of operations because the elimination of one time benefits and charges that are included in the gaap financial measures results in an enhanced comparability of certain key financial results between the periods presented 
in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december  income before taxes gaap  as reported    gain on settlement of litigation write off of deferred costs income before taxes  excluding one time benefit and charges  percentage increase over prior period net income gaap  as reported    gain on settlement of litigation  write off of deferred costs benefit from restoration of net deferred tax assets net income  excluding one time benefits and charges   percentage increase over prior period fully diluted earnings per share gaap  as reported gain on settlement of litigation write off of deferred costs benefit from restoration of net deferred tax assets fully diluted earnings per share  excluding one time benefits and charges percentage increase over prior period this reflects a net pretax gain of million associated with a litigation settlement during the first quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this reflects a pretax write off of million in deferred loans costs and a debt discount associated with the early retirement of our senior notes during the fourth quarter of this reflects a net after tax gain of million  or per fully diluted share associated with a litigation settlement during the first quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this reflects an after tax write off of million  or per fully diluted share in deferred loans costs and a debt discount associated with the early retirement of our senior notes during the fourth quarter of this reflects a change in the valuation allowance associated with our net tax assets as of december   which resulted in the recognition of a current tax benefit in the amount of million  or per fully diluted share during the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
risk factors our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause our stock price to decrease 
our quarterly operating results will likely vary in the future  due to a variety of factors that could affect our revenues and operating expenses in any particular quarter 
we expect that our operating expenses as a percentage of collections will fluctuate in the future as we expand into new markets  increase our new business development efforts  hire additional personnel  and incur increased insurance and regulatory compliance costs 
in addition  our operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate as the result of the factors described below and elsewhere in this report the timing and amount of collections on our receivables portfolios  including the effects of seasonality  any charge to earnings resulting from an impairment in the carrying value of our receivables portfolios  increases in operating expenses associated with the growth or change of our operations  the cost of credit to finance our purchases of receivables portfolios  and the timing and terms of our purchases of receivables portfolios 
there has been considerable variation in our purchasing volume from quarter to quarter and we expect that to continue 
further  our industry is currently experiencing increased competition in the purchase of receivables portfolios  resulting in rising prices and decreasing profitability 
the volume of our portfolio purchases may continue to be limited while prices are high 
because we recognize revenue on the basis of projected collections on purchased portfolios  we may experience variations in quarterly revenue and earnings due to the timing of portfolio purchases 
the american institute of certified public accountants has issued a statement of position  which is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of  that revises the accounting standard that governs underperforming receivables portfolios 
under the revised standard  material decreases in expected cash flows would result in an impairment charge while the yield we recognize on the receivables portfolio would remain unchanged  which would have an adverse effect on our earnings 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and revenues and earnings for any particular future period may decrease 
we may not be able to curtail our spending quickly enough if our revenues fall short of our expectations 
in the future  operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock would likely decrease 
we may not be able to purchase receivables at sufficiently favorable prices or terms for us to be successful 
our ability to operate profitably in the long run depends upon the continued availability of receivables for purchase on a cost effective basis 
based on our business model  we seek to purchase receivables portfolios where projected collections will exceed our acquisition costs by some multiple  depending on the types of receivables involved 
an increase in the purchase price of portfolios due to increased market competition or other factors would not produce a change in the projected collections of those same portfolios  but such an increase would reduce the ratio of collections to acquisitions costs for a given portfolio  and thereby negatively affect our profitability 
the availability of receivables portfolios at favorable prices and on favorable terms depends on a number of factors  including the continuation of the current growth and charge off trends in consumer debt and sales of receivables portfolios by originating institutions  our ability to develop and maintain long term relationships with key major credit originators  our ability to obtain adequate data from credit originators or portfolio resellers to appropriately evaluate the collectibility of  and estimate the value of  portfolios  and competitive factors affecting potential purchasers and sellers of receivables  including competitive pricing pressures  which may increase the cost to us of acquiring portfolios of receivables and reduce our return on such purchased portfolios 
recently  our industry has attracted a large amount of investment capital 
with this inflow of capital  we have seen a significant increase in the pricing of portfolios to levels that we believe will generate marginally acceptable returns on investment 
while we believe that prices should return to justifiable levels in the long term  the current environment for portfolio purchases will be challenging 
as an example  despite bidding significantly more for an annual forward flow arrangement that we had maintained for several years  we were out bid for the contract and have been replacing this contract with individual purchases 
to operate profitably over the long term  we must continually purchase and collect on a sufficient volume of receivables to generate cash collections and the related revenues that exceed our acquisition and collection costs by acceptable mergins 
we may not be successful at acquiring and collecting on portfolios consisting of new types of receivables 
we may pursue the acquisition of portfolios consisting of assets with which we have little collection experience 
we may not be successful in completing any of these acquisitions 
our lack of experience with new types of receivables may cause us to pay too much for these portfolios  which may also result in losses 
our limited experience in collection of these new types of receivables may result in losses 
we may not be able to collect sufficient amounts on our receivables portfolios to recover our costs and fund our operations 
we acquire and service receivables that the obligors have failed to pay and the sellers have deemed uncollectible and written off 
the originating institutions generally make numerous attempts to recover on their non performing receivables  often using a combination of their in house collection and legal departments as well as third party collection agencies 
these receivables are difficult to collect and we may not be successful in collecting amounts sufficient to cover the costs associated with purchasing the receivables and funding our operations 
the statistical model we use to project remaining cash flows from our receivables portfolios may prove to be inaccurate  which could result in reduced revenues if we do not achieve the collections forecasted by our model 
we utilize our internally developed unified collection score ucs model to project the remaining cash flows from our receivables portfolios 
our ucs model considers known data about our customers accounts  including  among other things  our collection experience and changes in external customer factors  in addition to all data known when we acquired the accounts 
our use of the ucs model has resulted in an increase in revenues due to upward aggregate adjustments to our projected collections 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to achieve the collections forecasted by our ucs model 
if we are not able to achieve these levels of collection  our revenues will be reduced  which could result in a reduction of our earnings 
our industry is highly competitive  and we may be unable to continue to successfully compete with businesses that may have greater resources than we have 
we face competition from a wide range of collection companies and financial services companies which may have substantially greater financial  personnel and other resources  greater adaptability to changing market needs and more established relationships in our industry than we currently have 
we also compete with traditional contingency collection agencies and in house recovery departments 
competitive pressures adversely affect the availability and pricing of charged off receivables portfolios  as well as the availability and cost of qualified recovery personnel 
as there are few significant barriers to entry for new purchasers of charged off receivables portfolios  we cannot assure you that additional competitors with greater resources than ours will not enter our market 
if we are unable to develop and expand our business or adapt to changing market needs as well as our current or future competitors are able to do  we may experience reduced access to charged off receivables portfolios at appropriate prices and reduced profitability 
moreover  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to offer competitive bids for charged off receivable portfolios 
we face bidding competition in our acquisition of charged off receivable portfolios 
in our industry  successful bids generally are awarded on a combination of price  service  and relationships with the debt sellers 
some of our current and future competitors may have more effective pricing and collection models  greater adaptability to changing market needs  and more established relationships in our industry 
they may also pay prices for portfolios that we determine are not reasonable 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to offer competitive bids for charged off consumer receivables portfolios 
in addition  there continues to be consolidation of issuers of credit cards  which have been a principal source of receivable purchases 
this consolidation has limited the number of sellers in the market and has correspondingly given the remaining sellers increasing market strength in the price and terms of the sale of credit card accounts 
our failure to purchase sufficient quantities of receivables portfolios may necessitate workforce reductions  which may harm our business 
because fixed costs  such as certain personnel salaries and lease or other facilities costs  constitute a significant portion of our overhead  if we do not continually augment the receivables portfolios we service with additional receivables portfolios or collect sufficient amounts on receivables owned or serviced by us  we may be required to reduce the number of employees in our collection operations 
these practices could lead to lower employee morale  higher employee attrition rates  fewer experienced employees and higher recruiting and training costs  disruptions in our operations and loss of efficiency in collection functions  and excess costs associated with unused space in collection facilities 
high financing costs currently have an adverse effect on our earnings 
in december  we entered into a million secured financing facility to fund portfolio purchases 
it provides the lender with interest at a stated rate plus participation in the profits from acquired portfolios 
the effective borrowing rate under this facility was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  these effective borrowing rates are calculated by including in the numerator the base interest paid to the lender  plus the lender s participation in the residual collections from the acquired portfolios  while the denominator is the average loan principal outstanding for the specified period 
however  pursuant to a recent amendment to this facility  the total amount owed the lender has been capped for most portfolios financed under the facility between october  and the facility s termination date  december   which will result in a reduction of our effective borrowing rate compared to what we would have owed under the facility absent such amendment 
under an agreement with this lender  we were required to offer the lender the opportunity to finance all purchases of credit card receivables portfolios using this facility through december  each note has a maturity date not to exceed months after the borrowing date 
this facility limits the earning potential for portfolios we own that are or were financed under it by increasing our costs of borrowing  subject to the caps imposed by our recent amendment 
the sharing in residual cash flows constitutes a future profit sharing obligation which continues for the entire economic life of most receivables portfolios financed using this facility  and will extend substantially beyond the expiration date of the secured financing facility 
the nature of this obligation to pay contingent interest is likely to continue to result in substantial effective rates of interest paid with respect to the secured financing facility 
a significant portion of our portfolio purchases during any period may be concentrated with a small number of sellers 
we expect that a significant percentage of our portfolio purchases for any given fiscal year may be concentrated with a few large sellers  some of which may also involve forward flow arrangements 
for example  our two principal sellers of consumer receivables in recent years have been among the top largest consumer credit card companies in the nation  one of which has accounted for more than twenty five percent of the charged off receivables we have purchased since under a forward flow arrangement that expired at then end of we cannot guarantee that any of our significant sellers will continue to sell charged off receivables to us on terms or in quantities acceptable to us  or that we would be able to replace such purchases with purchases from other sellers 
a significant decrease in the volume of purchases from any of our principal sellers would force us to seek alternative sources of charged off receivables 
we may be unable to find alternative sources from which to purchase charged off receivables  and even if we could successfully replace such purchases  the search could take time  the receivables could be of lower quality  cost more  or both  any of which could adversely affect our financial performance 
we may be unable to meet our future liquidity requirements 
we depend on both internal and external sources of financing to fund our purchases of receivables portfolios and our operations 
our need for additional financing and capital resources increases dramatically as our business grows 
our inability to obtain financing and capital as needed or on terms acceptable to us would limit our ability to acquire additional receivables portfolios and to operate our business 
we may not be able to continue to satisfy the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements 
our debt agreements impose a number of restrictive covenants 
failure to satisfy any one of these covenants could result in all or any of the following adverse results acceleration of indebtedness outstanding  cross defaults and acceleration of indebtedness under other financing agreements  our removal as servicer under our secured financing transactions and possibly other cross defaulted facilities and loss of servicing fees and other consequences  liquidation of the receivables in our secured financing transactions and loss of our expected future excess recoveries on receivables in the financed pools  our inability to continue to make purchases of receivables needed to operate our business  or our inability to secure alternative financing on favorable terms  if at all 
we use estimates in our accounting and our earnings will be reduced if actual results are less than estimated 
we utilize the interest method to determine revenue recognized on substantially all of our receivables portfolios 
under this method  each pool of receivables is modeled upon its projected cash flows 
a yield is then established which  when applied to the outstanding balance of the receivables  results in the recognition of revenue at a constant yield relative to the remaining balance in the receivables portfolio 
the actual amount recovered by us on portfolios may substantially differ from our projections and may be lower than initially projected 
if differences are material  then we may reduce our yield  which would negatively affect our earnings  or take a write off on all or a portion of our investment 
we will be required to change how we account for underperforming receivables portfolios  which will have an adverse effect on our earnings 
the american institute of certified public accountants has issued a statement of position sop  accounting for loans and certain debt securities acquired in a transfer  that revises the accounting standard that governs underperforming receivables portfolios 
this sop is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of under the standard  material increases in expected cash flows will continue to result in a prospective increase in the yield we recognize on a receivables portfolio 
however  material decreases in expected cash flows would result in an impairment charge while the yield we recognize on the receivables portfolio would remain unchanged  which would have an adverse effect on our earnings 
our earnings will be reduced by the payment of substantial amounts in income taxes as a result of our full utilization of our federal net operating loss carry forward in prior to fiscal year  we did not pay federal income taxes for several years as we utilized our net operating loss carry forward to offset our federal tax liability 
as of december   we had an approximate million federal net operating loss carry forward 
in  we fully utilized this carry forward to partially offset our federal tax obligation 
as a result  we have begun to pay federal income taxes at a rate on taxable income requiring us to use a portion of our financial resources to pay federal income taxes  which will reduce the funds we have available to invest in new receivables portfolios or for other corporate purposes 
government regulation may limit our ability to recover and enforce the collection of receivables 
federal and state laws may limit our ability to recover and enforce receivables regardless of any act or omission on our part 
some laws and regulations applicable to credit card issuers or other debt originators may preclude us from collecting on receivables we purchase where the card issuer or originator failed to comply with applicable federal or state laws in generating or servicing the receivables that we have acquired 
laws relating to debt collections also directly apply to our business 
additional consumer protection or privacy laws and regulations may be enacted that impose additional restrictions on the collection of receivables 
such new laws may adversely affect our ability to collect on our receivables  which could adversely affect our earnings 
our failure or the failure of the originators of our receivables to comply with existing or new laws  rules or regulations could limit our ability to recover on receivables or cause us to pay damages to the original debtors  which could reduce our revenues and harm our business 
because our receivables are generally originated and serviced nationwide  we cannot assure you that the originating lenders have complied with applicable laws and regulations 
while receivables acquisition contracts typically contain provisions indemnifying us for losses due to the originating institution s failure to comply with applicable laws and other events  we cannot assure you that any indemnities received from originating institutions will be adequate to protect us from losses on the receivables or liabilities to customers 
we are subject to ongoing risks of litigation  including individual or class actions under securities  consumer credit  collections  employment and other laws 
we operate in an extremely litigious climate and may be named as defendants in litigation  including individual or class actions under securities laws or employment laws as well as consumer credit  collections  and various other consumer oriented laws 
if our future quarterly operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the price of our common stock may decline 
stock price fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock continues to be low 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been filed against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its stock 
defending a lawsuit  regardless of its merit  could be costly and could divert management s attention from the operation of our business 
the use of certain collection strategies could be restricted if class action plaintiffs were to prevail in their claims 
in addition  insurance costs continue to increase significantly and policy deductibles have also increased 
all of these factors could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we may make acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources from time to time  we consider acquisitions of other companies in our industry that could complement our business  including the acquisition of entities in diverse geographic regions and entities offering greater access to businesses and markets that we do not currently serve 
we may not be able to successfully acquire other businesses or  if we do  we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses with our own 
further  acquisitions may place additional constraints on our resources such as diverting the attention of our management from other business concerns 
through acquisitions  we may enter markets in which we have limited or no experience 
the occurrence of one or more of these events may divert management s attention from the successful operation of our business  which may result in decreased collections and earnings 
moreover  any acquisition may result in a potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  incurrence of additional debt and amortization of identifiable intangible assets  all of which could reduce our profitability 
recent legislative actions and proposed regulations will require corporate governance initiatives  which may be difficult and expensive to implement 
to implement required corporate governance initiatives mandated by the sarbanes oxley act  the securities and exchange commission and the recently adopted nasdaq rules  we may be required to enhance our internal controls  hire additional personnel and utilize additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services  all of which would cause our general and administrative expenses to substantially increase 
we also expect that the premiums we pay for directors and officers insurance policies will increase in the future as a result of higher claim rates incurred by insurers on other insured companies in recent years 
these increased costs will adversely affect our operating results by increasing expenses by an amount that is significant for a company of our size 
in addition  senior management s attention to our core business may be diverted by these initiatives which could result in decreased collections and earnings 
we may not be able to hire and retain enough sufficiently trained employees to support our operations  and or we may experience high rates of personnel turnover 
our industry is very labor intensive 
we generally compete for qualified personnel with companies in our business and in the collection agency  tele services and telemarketing industries 
we will not be able to service our receivables effectively  continue our growth and operate profitably if we cannot hire and retain qualified collection personnel 
further  high turnover rate among our employees increases our recruiting and training costs and may limit the number of experienced collection personnel available to service our receivables 
our newer employees tend to be less productive and generally produce the greatest rate of personnel turnover 
if the turnover rate among our employees increases  we will have fewer experienced employees available to service our receivables  which could reduce collections and therefore result in lower revenues and earnings 
the failure of our technology and phone systems could have an adverse effect on our operations 
our success depends in large part on sophisticated telecommunications and computer systems 
the temporary or permanent loss of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems  through casualty  operating malfunction  software virus  or service provider failure  could disrupt our operations 
in the normal course of our business  we must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to properly bid on prospective acquisitions of receivables portfolios and to access  maintain and expand the databases we use for our collection activities 
any simultaneous failure of our information systems and their backup systems would interrupt our business operations 
our business depends heavily on service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies 
a significant increase in telephone service costs or any significant interruption in telephone services could negatively affect our operating results or disrupt our operations 
we may not be able to successfully anticipate  invest in or adopt technological advances within our industry our business relies on computer and telecommunications technologies and our ability to integrate new technologies into our business is essential to our competitive position and our success 
we may not be successful in anticipating  managing  or adopting technological changes on a timely basis 
computer and telecommunications technologies are evolving rapidly and are characterized by short product life cycles 
while we believe that our existing information systems are sufficient to meet our current and foreseeable demands and continued expansion  our future growth may require additional investment in these systems 
we depend on having the capital resources necessary to invest in new technologies to acquire and service receivables 
we cannot assure you that adequate capital resources will be available to us 
we may not be able to adequately protect the intellectual property rights upon which we rely we rely on proprietary software programs and valuation and collection processes and techniques and we believe that these assets provide us with a competitive advantage 
we consider our proprietary software  processes and techniques to be trade secrets 
we may not be able to adequately protect our technology and data resources 
we have engaged in transactions with members of our board of directors  significant stockholders  an entities affiliated with them  future transactions with related parties could pose conflicts of interest in the past  we have engaged in transactions with members of our board of directors  significant stockholders  and entities affiliated with them  which inherently give rise to conflicts of interest 
for example  certain of these parties have previously provided financing and financial guarantees to encore and have received additional equity interests  such as warrants  in connection with such transactions 
transactions with related parties such as these pose a risk that such transactions are on terms that are not as beneficial to the company as those that may be arranged with third parties 
our board of directors monitors transactions entered into by the company and where such transactions involve a related party or otherwise are perceived to present a conflict of interest  takes steps designed to mitigate such conflicts  such as submitting the proposed transaction to those directors who are unaffiliated with the related party involved in the transaction or otherwise not subject to a conflict of interest for their review and approval 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings 
as of december   we had total variable rate borrowings of million  which consisted of our secured financing facility and our revolving credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in short term interest rates also affect our earnings as a result of our borrowings under variable rate borrowing agreements 
if the market interest rates for our variable rate agreements increase at an average of  interest expense would increase  and income before income taxes would decrease by approximately million  on an annualized basis  based on the amount of related outstanding borrowings as of december  of million 
conversely  if market interest rates decreased an average of  our interest expense would decrease  thereby increasing income before income taxes by approximately million  on an annualized basis  based on borrowings as of december
