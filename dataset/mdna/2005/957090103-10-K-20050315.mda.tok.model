item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion addresses information pertaining to the financial condition and results of operations of westamerica bancorporation and subsidiaries the company that may not be otherwise apparent from a review of the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
it should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes found on pages through  as well as with the other information presented throughout the report 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make certain estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment writedown or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the amount of loss in the loan portfolio that can be reasonably estimated as of the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends  uncertainties and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the credit quality discussion below 
overview of financial results acquisition on august   the company signed a definitive agreement to acquire redwood empire bancorp  parent company of national bank of the redwoods 
on january   the federal reserve system frb approved the company s merger application subject to a divestiture of approximately million in

table of contents investment portfolio the company maintains a securities portfolio consisting of us government sponsored entities  state and political subdivisions  asset backed and other securities 
investment securities are held in safekeeping by an independent custodian 
the objective of the held to maturity portfolio is to maintain a prudent yield and provide collateral to pledge for federal  state and local government deposits and other borrowing facilities 
the held to maturity investment portfolio had a duration of years at december  and  on the same date  those investments included  million in fixed rate and million in adjustable rate securities

credit quality the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and continues its strategy to control exposure to loans with higher credit risk and to increase diversification of the loan portfolio 
credit reviews are performed using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
loans receiving lesser grades fall under the classified loans category  which includes all nonperforming and potential problem loans  and receive an elevated level of management attention to ensure collection 
classified loans and other real estate owned the following summarizes the company s classified loans for the periods indicated classified loans and oreo at december  dollars in thousands classified loans other real estate owned total 
table of contents classified loans at december  declined million or to million from december   mainly due to upgrades  payoffs  principal reductions and chargeoffs  partially reduced by new downgrades and new loans 
other real estate owned decreased thousand from the prior year to none  due to sales of two small properties 
nonperforming loans nonperforming credits include nonaccrual loans and loans or more days past due and still accruing 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming delinquent days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
interest previously accrued on loans placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income 
in addition  some loans secured by real estate with temporarily impaired values and commercial loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties are placed on nonaccrual status even though the borrowers continue to repay the loans as scheduled 
such loans are classified by management as performing nonaccrual and are included in total nonaccrual credits 
when the ability to fully collect nonaccrual loan principal is in doubt  payments received are applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected 
any additional interest payments received after that time are recorded as interest income on a cash basis 
nonaccrual loans are reinstated to accrual status when improvements in credit quality eliminate the doubt as to the full collectibility of both interest and principal 
the following table summarizes the nonperforming assets of the company for the periods indicated nonperforming loans and oreo at december  dollars in thousands performing nonaccrual loans nonperforming nonaccrual loans nonaccrual loans loans or more days past due and still accruing other real estate owned total nonperforming loans and oreo allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans and loans or more days past due and still accruing allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans and oreo performing nonaccrual loans at december  were million higher than the previous year  due to new loans placed on performing nonaccrual  partially offset by payoffs  chargeoffs  loans being returned to accrual status and loans being placed on nonperforming nonaccrual 
nonperforming nonaccrual loans at december  decreased million from the same period a year ago  attributable to loans being returned to accrual status  transfers to repossessed collateral or being charged off or paid off  partially offset by loans being added to nonperforming nonaccrual 
there was no oreo at december  as a result of sales of two small properties 
performing nonaccrual loans at december  were million below the previous year  while nonperforming loans remained at the same level 
with the exception of four relationships totaling thousand  all loans on nonaccrual status in were either paid off  charged off or brought current in except for one property  all foreclosed property owned in was disposed of at a small total net gain during  the thousand in oreo at december  consisted of two small parcels 
the company had no restructured loans as of december   and 
table of contents the amount of gross interest income that would have been recorded if all nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms while outstanding during the period was thousand in  thousand in and thousand in the amount of interest income that was recognized on nonaccrual loans from cash payments made in  and was thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
cash payments received  which were applied against the book balance of performing and nonperforming nonaccrual loans outstanding at december   totaled approximately thousand  compared with thousand in and thousand in management believes the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio continues to be strong  however  total nonperforming assets could fluctuate from year to year 
the performance of any individual loan can be impacted by external factors such as the interest rate environment or factors particular to the borrower 
the company expects to maintain nonperforming loans and oreo at their current levels  however  no assurance can be given that additional increases in nonaccrual loans will not occur in future periods 
loan loss experience the company s allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be estimated based upon specific and general conditions 
these include conditions unique to individual borrowers  as well as overall loan loss experience  the amount of past due  nonperforming loans and classified loans  recommendations of regulatory authorities  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
a portion of the allowance is specifically allocated to impaired and other identified loans whose full collectibility is uncertain 
such allocations are determined by management based on loan by loan analyses 
a second allocation is based in part on quantitative analyses of historical loan loss experience  in which criticized and classified loan balances identified through an internal loan review process are analyzed using a linear regression model to determine standard loss rates 
the results of this analysis are applied to current criticized and classified loan balances to allocate the reserve to the respective segments of the loan portfolio 
in addition  loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines are analyzed based on the historical loss rates and delinquency trends  grouped by the number of days the payments on these loans are delinquent 
last  allocations are made to general loan categories based on commercial office vacancy rates  mortgage loan foreclosure trends  agriculture commodity prices  and levels of government funding 
the remainder of the reserve is considered to be unallocated and is established at a level considered necessary based on relevant economic conditions and available data  including unemployment statistics  unidentified economic and business conditions  the quality of lending management and staff  credit quality trends  concentrations of credit  and changing underwriting standards due to external competitive factors 
management considers the million allowance for loan losses  which is equivalent to of total loans at december   to be adequate as a reserve against losses as of december  during  management refined its allowance methodology for commercial real estate loans  agricultural loans and certain municipal loans 
this refinement had the effect of increasing the allowance allocation for commercial loans with a corresponding decrease in the unallocated allowance as of december

the measurement of impairment may be based on i the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the observable market price of the impaired loan or iii the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan 
the company does not apply this definition to smaller balance loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
in measuring impairment  the company reviews all commercial and construction loans classified substandard and doubtful that meet materiality thresholds of thousand and thousand  respectively 
the company considers classified loans below the established thresholds to represent immaterial credit risk 
all loans classified as loss are considered impaired 
commercial and construction loans that are not classified  and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as installment  personal revolving credit  residential real estate and student loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology 
the company generally identifies loans to be reported as impaired when such loans are in nonaccrual status or are considered troubled debt restructurings due to the granting of a below market rate of interest or a partial forgiveness of indebtedness on an existing loan 
the following summarizes the company s impaired loans for the periods indicated impaired loans year ended december  dollars in thousands total impaired loans specific reserves the average balance of the company s impaired loans for the year ended december  was thousand compared to million in portions of the company s allowance for loan losses were 
table of contents allocated to each of these impaired loans 
in general  the company does not recognize any interest income on troubled debt restructuring or loans that are classified as nonaccrual 
for other impaired loans  interest income may be recorded as cash is received  provided that the company s recorded investment in such loans is deemed collectible 
asset and liability management the fundamental objective of the company s management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing net interest margin and net interest income 
at times  depending on expected increases or decreases in general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  management may adjust the company s interest rate risk position in order to manage its net interest margin and net interest income 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain subject to changes in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
the primary analytical tool used by the company to quantify interest rate risk is a simulation model to project changes in net interest income nii that result from forecast changes in interest rates 
this analysis calculated the difference between a nii forecast over a month period using a stable interest rate scenario and a nii forecast using a rising or falling interest rate scenario with the federal funds rate serving as a primary indicator 
based on economic conditions  interest rate levels  anticipated monetary policy and management judgment  at december   simulations were conducted with the federal funds rate rising by basis points or declining by basis points over the month forecast interval triggering a response in the other rates 
similarly  at december   simulations were conducted with the federal funds rate rising by basis points or declining by basis points over the month forecast interval triggering a response in the other rates 
company policy requires that such simulated changes in nii should be within certain specified ranges or steps must be taken to reduce interest rate risk 
the following tables summarize the simulated change in nii fte  based on the month period ending december  and simulated changes to net interest income estimated increase decrease in nii estimated changes in interest rates basis points nii amount amount percent dollars in millions estimated increase decrease in nii estimated changes in interest rates basis points nii amount amount percent dollars in millions management reviewed its interest rate risk position  taking into account the acquisition of redwood empire bancorp 
in management s judgment  the company s interest rate risk exposure would be reduced through the sale of investment securities available for sale  with the proceeds from sale applied to reduce short term borrowed funds 
during the first quarter  the company sold million of investment 
table of contents securities available for sale with a duration of years and book yield of at a realized loss of million  net of tax 
the following table summarizes the interest rate sensitivity gaps inherent in the company s asset and liability portfolios at december  interest rate sensitivity analysis repricing within days non over repricing total dollars in thousands assets investment securities loans other assets total assets liabilities noninterest bearing interest bearing transaction money market savings passbook savings time short term borrowings federal funds purchased other debt financing and notes payable other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net liabilities assets subject to repricing cumulative net liabilities assets subject to repricing the repricing terms of the table above do not represent contractual principal maturities  but rather principal cash flows and balances available for repricing 
the interest rate sensitivity report shown above categorizes interest bearing transaction deposits  savings deposits and other short term borrowings as repricing within days 
however  it is the experience of management that the historical interest rate volatility of these funding sources can be similar to liabilities with longer repricing dates  depending on market conditions 
moreover  the degree to which these deposits respond to changes in money market rates usually is less than the response of interest rate sensitivity loans 
these factors cause management to believe the cumulative net liability position shown above to indicate a much greater degree of liability sensitivity than reasonably exists based on the additional analysis previously discussed 
liquidity the company s principal source of asset liquidity is investment securities available for sale and principal payments from consumer loans 
at december   investment securities available for sale totaled 
table of contents million 
at december   residential real estate loans and indirect auto loans totaled million  which were experiencing stable monthly principal payments of approximately million 
in addition  at december   the company had customary lines for overnight borrowings from other financial institutions in excess of million and a million line of credit  under which no amount was outstanding at december  as a member of the federal reserve system  the company also has the ability to borrow from the federal reserve

similarly  in  the operating activities provided a substantial portion of cash for million in shareholder dividends and million for the company s stock repurchase programs 
during  financing activities included a million increase in deposits and a million increase in short term borrowings  offset in part by a million payment of fhlb advances and prepayment fees 
in  other financing activities included the net result of a million increase in deposits and a million increase in short term borrowings  reduced by a million payment of fhlb advances including a loss on extinguishment of debt

in  purchases  net of maturities  of investment securities were million  which was in part offset by net repayments of loans of million 
the investment securities portfolio increase was generally financed by a million increase in deposits  and a million increase in short term borrowings 
during purchases net of sales and maturities of investment securities of million were reduced by net repayments of loans of million and million cash obtained in the ksb acquisition  resulting in net cash used of million 
in the first quarter of  the company used approximately million in cash as a partial payment for the acquisition of redwood empire bancorp  which use had been largely facilitated in by adjusting the allocation of operating cash flow from repurchases and retirement of common stock 
the company anticipates maintaining its cash levels through the end of mainly due to increased profitability and retained earnings 
it is anticipated that loan demand will increase moderately  although such demand will be dictated by economic conditions 
the growth of deposit balances is expected to exceed the anticipated growth in loan demand through the end of  resulting in an increase in the investment securities portfolio  a reduction of time deposits and borrowed funds  or a combination of both 
however  due to concerns regarding consumer confidence  possible terrorist attacks  the war in iraq  and uncertainty in the general economic environment  loan demand and levels of customer deposits are not certain
