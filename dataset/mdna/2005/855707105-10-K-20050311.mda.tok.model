state auto p c  milbank  farmers and sa ohio are hereafter referred to collectively as the stfc pooled companies 
see pooling arrangement in the narrative description of business 
the pooled companies and sa national are hereafter referred to as the state auto group 
the insurers in the state auto group write a broad line of property and casualty insurance  such as standard personal and commercial automobile  nonstandard personal automobile  homeowners  commercial multi peril  workers compensation  general liability and fire insurance  through approximately  independent insurance agents associated with approximately  agencies in states 
the state auto group s insurance products are marketed primarily in the central and eastern parts of the united states  excluding new york  new jersey and the new england states 

table of contents state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company the company considers one of its key strengths to be its core values  which are to i fairly price and ethically sell useful insurance products  ii treat every transaction with absolute honesty and integrity  iii extend dignity and respect to everyone  iv encourage innovation  and v fully utilize every person s talents 
these core values are reflected in  among other things  the long term strategic business plan adopted by the boards of directors of mutual and stfc 
this strategic business plan provides that the long term goal of the state auto group is to continue to be a premier  independent property and casualty insurer by consistently performing in the top quartile of its peer group of companies 
the company believes its underwriting and pricing discipline  as well as its commitment to delivering its products as effectively and efficiently as possible  have been key factors in the company s underwriting results over the last several years 
b financial information about segments the company currently operates in three segments state auto standard insurance  state auto nonstandard insurance  and investment management services 
prior to  it operated in the following four insurance segments the state auto standard insurance segment  consisting of the business operations of the stfc pooled companies  the state auto nonstandard segment  consisting of the business operations of sa national and mid plains  the meridian standard segment  consisting of the standard insurance business of the former meridian mutual  and the meridian nonstandard segment  consisting of the nonstandard business of the former meridian mutual 
as of january  and january   the meridian standard and nonstandard segments  respectively  were included in the state auto standard and nonstandard segments because these meridian segments no longer met the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as reportable segments 
financial information about all these segments is set forth in note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
additional information regarding the company s insurance and non insurance segments is provided in narrative description of business 
c narrative description of business property and casualty insurance pooling arrangement the pooled companies are parties to an intercompany pooling arrangement 
the pooling arrangement was governed by the reinsurance pooling agreement known as the pooling agreement prior to january   and by the reinsurance pooling agreement known as the pooling agreement on and after that date 
the pooling arrangement covers all the property and casualty insurance written by the parties  except voluntary assumed reinsurance written by mutual  mutual middle market insurance as defined in the pooling agreement and intercompany catastrophe reinsurance written by state auto p c 
under the pooling arrangement each participant cedes premiums  losses and expenses on all of their business to mutual  and mutual in turn cedes to each participant a specified portion of premiums  losses and expenses based on each participant s pooling percentage 
mutual then retains the balance of the pooled business 
mutual  sa wisconsin  sa florida  meridian security and meridian citizens mutual are hereafter referred to collectively as the mutual pooled companies

prior to  the pooling percentages were reviewed by management at least annually  and more often if deemed appropriate by management or the board of directors of each company  to determine whether any adjustments should be made 
as a result of the changes made to the pooling percentages in  it is not management s current intention to recommend an adjustment to the stfc pooled companies aggregate participation percentage in the foreseeable future 
under revised procedures  management of each of the pooled companies would make recommendations to a standing independent committee of the board of both mutual and stfc 
these independent committees would review and evaluate such factors as they deem relevant and recommend any appropriate pooling change to the boards of both mutual and stfc 
see management agreement in the narrative description of business 
the pooling arrangement is terminable by any party on days notice or by mutual agreement of the parties 
none of the pooled companies currently intends to terminate the pooling arrangement 
under the terms of the pooling arrangement  all premiums  incurred losses  loss expenses and other underwriting expenses are prorated among the companies party to the agreement on the basis of their participation in the pool 
by spreading the underwriting risk among each of the participants  the pooling arrangement is designed to produce more uniform and stable underwriting results for each of the pooled companies than any one company would experience individually 
one effect of the pooling arrangement is to provide each participant with an identical mix of pooled property and casualty insurance business on a net basis 
the pooling agreement and the pooling agreement both contain a provision excluding catastrophic losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred by the parties in the amount of million in excess of million  as well as the premium for such exposures 
state auto p c reinsures each insurer in the state auto group for this layer of reinsurance under a catastrophe assumption agreement 
no losses were paid by state auto p c under the catastrophe assumption agreement in  or see reinsurance in the narrative description of business 
prior to january   the direct business of the migi insurers was not included in the pooling arrangement and to that extent was not included in the insurance operations of the company for periods ending prior to january  if state auto p c had been required to pay catastrophe losses of the migi insurers under the above referenced catastrophe assumption agreement  those losses would have impacted the company s results 
also  excluded from both the pooling agreement and the pooling agreement is mutual middle market insurance 
if state auto p c were required to pay catastrophe losses of the mutual middle market insurance under the above referenced catastrophe assumption agreement  these losses would impact the company s results

marketing the state auto group markets its products in states through approximately  insurance agents associated with approximately  independent insurance agencies 
none of the companies in the state auto group has any contracts with managing general agencies 
sa national markets nonstandard products in states exclusively through the company s network of independent agents 
mid plains wrote nonstandard auto insurance in iowa and kansas through the agency network of farmers in those states 
in december  mid plains was dissolved and its insurance liabilities were assumed by sa national 
see nonstandard auto insurance in the narrative description of business 
because independent insurance agents significantly influence which insurance company their customers select  management views the company s independent insurance agents as its primary customers 
management strongly supports the independent agency system and believes that maintenance of a strong agency system is essential for the company s present and future success 
as such  the company continually develops programs and procedures to enhance agency relationships  including the following regular travel by senior management and branch office staff to meet with agents  in person  in their home states  training opportunities  travel incentives related to profit and growth  and an agent stock purchase plan 
the company actively helps its agencies develop professional sales skills within their staff 
the training programs include both products and sales training in concentrated programs conducted in the company s home office 
further  the training programs include disciplined follow up and coaching for an extended time 
other targeted training sessions are held in the company s branch office locations from time to time 
the company has made continuing efforts to use technology to make it easier for its agents to do business with the company 
the company offers internet based rating  policy application submission and execution of endorsements for certain products 
in addition  the company provides its agents with the opportunity to maintain policyholder records electronically  avoiding the expense of preparing and storing paper records 
software developed by sis also enhances the ability of the company and its agents to take advantage of electronic data submission 
the company believes that  since agents and their customers realize better service and efficiencies through automation  they value their relationship with the company 
automation can make it easier for the agent to do business with the company  which attracts prospective agents and enhances the existing agencies relationships with the company 
the company shares the cost of approved advertising with selected agencies 
the company provides agents with certain travel and cash incentives if they achieve certain sales and underwriting profit levels 
further  the company recognizes its very top agencies measured by consistent profitability  achievement of written premium thresholds and growth as inner circle agencies 
inner circle agencies are rewarded with additional trip and financial incentives  including additional profit sharing bonus and additional contributions to their inner circle agent stock purchase plan  a part of the agent stock purchase plan described below 
to strengthen agency commitment to producing profitable business and further develop its agency relationships  the company s agent stock purchase plan offers its agents the opportunity to use commission income to purchase the company s stock 
the company s transfer agent administers the plan using commission dollars assigned by the agents to purchase shares on the open market through a stockbroker 
the company also makes available to certain top performing agents the opportunity to vest grants of options in the company s common shares provided the participants meet performance targets described in the agent stock option plan 
the company receives premiums on products marketed in alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  iowa  kansas  kentucky  maryland  michigan  minnesota  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  north dakota  ohio  oklahoma  pennsylvania  south carolina  south dakota  tennessee  utah  virginia  west virginia and wisconsin

table of contents state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company claims insurance claims on policies written by the company are usually investigated and settled by staff claims adjusters 
the company s claims division emphasizes timely investigation of claims  settlement of meritorious claims for equitable amounts  maintenance of adequate reserves for claims  and control of external claims adjustment expenses 
achievement of these goals supports the company s marketing efforts by providing agents and policyholders with prompt and effective service 
claim settlement authority levels are established for each adjuster  supervisor and manager based on his or her level of expertise and experience 
the claims division is responsible for reviewing the claim  obtaining necessary documentation and establishing loss and expense reserves of certain claims 
generally  property or casualty claims estimated to reach  or above are sent to the home office to be supervised by claims division specialists 
branches with small volumes of large claims report claims to the home office at a lower dollar threshold 
in territories in which there is not sufficient volume to justify having full time adjusters  the company uses independent appraisers and adjusters to evaluate and settle claims under the supervision of claims division personnel 
the company attempts to minimize claims adjusting costs by settling as many claims as possible through its internal claims staff and  if possible  by settling disputes regarding automobile physical damage and property insurance claims first party claims through arbitration 
in addition  selected agents have authority to settle small first party claims  which improves claims service 
claim representatives use third party  proprietary bodily injury evaluation software to help them value bodily injury claims  except for the most severe injury cases 
this software continues to be a valuable tool for the company 
the claims contact centers allow the company to improve claims efficiency and economy by concentrating the handling of smaller  less complex claims in a centralized environment 
the company provides hour  seven days a week claim service  either through associates in the claims contact centers  which are located in des moines  iowa and columbus  ohio  or  for a few overnight hours  through a third party service provider 
reserves loss reserves are management s best estimates at a given point in time of what the company expects to pay to claimants  based on facts  circumstances and historical trends then known 
during the loss settlement period  additional facts regarding individual claims may become known  and consequently it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability 
the company s results of operations and financial condition could be impacted  perhaps significantly  in the future if the ultimate payments required to settle claims vary from the liability currently recorded 
the company maintains reserves for the eventual payment of losses and loss expenses for both reported claims and incurred claims that have not yet been reported 
loss expense reserves are intended to cover the ultimate costs of settling all losses  including investigation  litigation and in house claims processing costs from such losses 
reserves for reported losses are initially established on either a case by case or formula basis depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 
the case by case reserve amounts are determined based on the company s reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and policy provisions relating to types of loss 
the formula reserves are based on historical paid loss data for similar claims with provisions for trend changes caused by inflation 
loss and loss expense reserves for incurred claims that have not yet been reported are estimated based on many variables including historical and statistical information  changes in exposure units  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates  and economic conditions 
case and formula basis loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis 
as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves 
generally  reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis which have not settled after six months  are case reserved at that time 
although management uses many resources to calculate reserves  there is no precise method for determining the ultimate liability 
the company does not discount loss reserves for financial statement purposes 
additional information regarding the company s reserves is included in item of this form k in the losses and loss expenses payable section included therein 
mutual has guaranteed the adequacy of state auto p c s loss and loss expense reserves as of december  pursuant to the guarantee  mutual has agreed to reimburse state auto p c for any losses and loss expenses in excess of state auto p c s december  reserves million that may develop from claims that have occurred on or prior to that date 
this guarantee ensures that any deficiency in the reserves of state auto p c as of december   under the pooling arrangement percentages effective on december  will be reimbursed by mutual 
as of december   there has been no adverse development of these reserves 
in the event mutual becomes financially impaired  and subject to regulatory restrictions  it may be unable to make any such reimbursement 

table of contents state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company the following table presents one year development information on changes in the reserve for loss and loss expenses of the company for each of the three years in the period ended december  year ended december millions beginning of year loss and loss expenses payable less reinsurance recoverable on losses and loss expenses payable net losses and loss expenses payable provision for losses and loss expenses occurring current year prior years total loss and loss expense payments for claims occurring during current year prior years total end of year net losses and loss expenses payable add reinsurance recoverable on losses and loss expenses payable losses and loss expenses payable includes amounts due from affiliates of million  million  and million  respectively

this line item shows increases decreases in the current calendar year in the provision for losses and loss expenses attributable to claims occurring in prior years 
the decrease of million and million in and  respectively  and the increase of million in for claims occurring in prior years is well within normal expectations for reserve development and claim settlement uncertainty 
includes amounts due from affiliates of million for and and million for includes net amounts assumed from affiliates of million  million  and million  respectively 
the following table sets forth the development of reserves for losses and loss expenses from through for the company 
net liability for losses and loss expenses payable sets forth the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date  net of reinsurance recoverables  for each of the indicated years 
this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in the current and all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date  including losses incurred but not reported to the company 
the lower portion of the table shows the re estimated amounts of the previously reported reserve based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimate is increased or decreased as more information becomes known about the claims incurred 
the upper section of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid with respect to the previously reported reserve as of the end of each succeeding year 
for example  through december   the company had paid of the currently estimated losses and loss expenses that had been incurred  but not paid  as of december  the amounts on the cumulative redundancy deficiency line represent the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years 
for example  the calendar year reserve has developed a million or redundancy through december  that amount has been included in operations over the ten years and did not have a significant effect on income in any one year 
the effects on income caused by changes in estimates of the reserves for losses and loss expenses for the most recent three years are shown in the foregoing three year loss development table 
in evaluating the information in the table  it should be noted that each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
for example  the amount of the redundancy related to losses settled in  but incurred in  will be included in the cumulative redundancy amount for years  and the table does not present accident or policy year development data  which readers may be more accustomed to analyzing 
conditions and trends that have affected the development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table

table of contents state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company reinsurance members of the state auto group follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of their exposures and paying to the reinsurers a portion of the premiums received 
insurance is ceded principally to reduce net liability on individual risks or for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophic losses 
although reinsurance does not legally discharge the individual members of the state auto group from primary liability for the full amount of limits applicable under their policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
each member of the state auto group is party to working reinsurance treaties for property  casualty and workers compensation lines with several reinsurers arranged through a reinsurance intermediary 
under the property per risk excess of loss treaty  each member is responsible for the first million of each covered loss  and the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
the terms of the casualty excess of loss program provide that each company in the state auto group is responsible for the first million of a covered loss 
the reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
also  certain unusual claim situations involving bodily injury liability  property damage  uninsured motorist and personal injury protection are covered by an arrangement that provides for million of coverage in excess of a million retention for each loss occurrence

net retentions under this contract may be submitted to the casualty excess of loss program  subject to a limit of million per loss occurrence 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
in addition to the workers compensation reinsurance program described above  as of july   each company in the state auto group became party to an agreement which provides an additional layer of excess of loss reinsurance for workers compensation losses involving multiple workers 
subject to million of retention  reinsurers are responsible for of the excess over million up to million of covered loss 
this coverage is subject to a maximum any one life limit of million 
the rates for this reinsurance are negotiated annually 
in addition  the state auto group has secured other reinsurance to limit the net cost of large loss events for certain types of coverage 
included are umbrella liability losses which are reinsured up to a limit of million above a maximum million retention 
the state auto group also makes use of facultative reinsurance for unique risk situations and participates in involuntary pools and associations in certain states 
the state auto group participates in an intercompany catastrophe reinsurance program 
under this program  the members of the state auto group  on a combined basis  retain the first million of catastrophe losses that affect at least two individual risks

there have been no losses assumed under this agreement 
to provide funding if the state auto group were to incur catastrophe losses in excess of million  state auto financial has a structured contingent financing arrangement in place with a financial institution and a syndicate of other lenders the lenders to provide up to million for reinsurance purposes 
in the event of such a loss  this arrangement provides that state auto financial would sell redeemable preferred shares to saf funding corporation  a special purpose company spc  which would borrow the money necessary for such purchase from the lenders 
state auto financial would then contribute to state auto p c the funds received from the sale of its preferred shares  thereby preserving the statutory surplus of state auto p c 
state auto p c would use the contributed capital to pay its direct catastrophe losses and losses assumed under the intercompany catastrophe reinsurance agreement 
state auto financial is obligated to repay spc which would repay the lenders by redeeming the preferred shares in ten semi annual installments 
in the event of a default by state auto financial  the obligation to repay spc has been secured by a put agreement among state auto financial  mutual and the lenders  under which mutual would be obligated to either purchase the preferred shares from spc or repay spc for the loan s outstanding 
this funding arrangement  if exercised  would have the impact of adding up to million of additional debt to the company while providing needed cash to pay claims  while at the same time preserving the investment portfolio of the company in the short term 
sa national has a reinsurance agreement with mutual pursuant to which mutual assumes up to million of each liability loss occurrence in excess of sa national s  of retention  and up to million of each catastrophe loss occurrence in excess of sa national s  of retention

table of contents state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company see the discussion regarding the federal terrorism risk insurance act of the terrorism act in the regulation section and in item of this form k in the other external factors section included therein 
regulation most states  including all the domiciliary states of the state auto group  have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems 
each insurance company in the holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
pursuant to these laws  the respective insurance departments may examine any members of the state auto group  at any time  require disclosure of material transactions involving insurer members of the holding company system  and require prior notice and an opportunity to disapprove of certain extraordinary transactions  including  but not limited to  extraordinary dividends to shareholders 
pursuant to these laws  all transactions within the holding company system affecting any members of the state auto group must be fair and equitable 
in addition  approval of the applicable insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the control of an insurer 
the insurance laws of all the domiciliary states of the state auto group provide that no person may acquire direct or indirect control of a domestic insurer without obtaining the prior written approval of the state insurance commissioner for such acquisition 
in addition to being regulated by the insurance department of its state of domicile  each insurance company is subject to supervision and regulation in the states in which it transacts business 
such supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of an insurance company s business operations and financial condition 
the primary purpose of such supervision and regulation is to ensure financial stability of insurance companies for the protection of policyholders 
the laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad regulatory powers relative to granting and revoking licenses to transact business  regulating trade practices  licensing agents  approving policy forms  setting reserve requirements  determining the form and content of required statutory financial statements  prescribing the types and amount of investments permitted and requiring minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus 
although premium rate regulation varies among states and lines of insurance  such regulations generally require approval of the regulatory authority prior to any changes in rates 
in addition  all of the states in which the state auto group transacts business have enacted laws which restrict these companies underwriting discretion 
examples of these laws include restrictions on policy terminations  restrictions on agency terminations and laws requiring companies to accept any applicant for automobile insurance 
these laws may adversely affect the ability of the insurers in the state auto group to earn a profit on their underwriting operations 
insurance companies are required to file detailed annual reports with the supervisory agencies in each of the states in which they do business  and their business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time 
there can be no assurance that such regulatory requirements will not become more stringent in the future and have an adverse effect on the operations of the state auto group 
dividends 
stfc s insurance subsidiaries generally are restricted by the insurance laws of their respective states of domicile as to the amount of dividends they may pay to stfc without the prior approval of the respective state regulatory authorities 
generally  the maximum dividend that may be paid by an insurance subsidiary during any year without prior regulatory approval is limited to the greater of a stated percentage of that subsidiary s statutory surplus as of a certain date  or adjusted net income of the subsidiary  for the preceding year 
under current law  a total of million is available for payment to state auto financial as a dividend from state auto p c  milbank  farmers  sa ohio and sa national during without prior approval from their respective domiciliary state insurance departments 
rate and related regulation 
in general  the company is not aware of the adoption of any adverse legislation or regulation by any state where the company did business during which would present material obstacles to the company s overall business 
however  several states where the company does business have passed or are considering more strict regulation of the use of credit scoring in rating and or risk selection in personal lines of business 
similarly  several states are considering restricting insurers rights to use loss history information maintained in various databases by insurance support organizations 
these tools help the company price its products more fairly and enhance its ability to compete for business that it believes will be profitable 
such regulations would limit the ability of the company  as well as the ability of all other insurance carriers operating in any affected jurisdiction  to take advantage of these tools 
in an attempt to make capital and surplus requirements more accurately reflect the underwriting risk of different lines of insurance as well as investment risks that attend insurers operations  the national association of insurance commissioners naic annually tests insurers risk based capital requirements 
as of december   each insurer affiliated with the company surpassed all standards tested by the formula applying risk based capital requirements 
the property and casualty insurance industry is also affected by court decisions 
premium rates are actuarially determined to enable an insurance company to generate an underwriting profit 
these rates contemplate a certain level of risk 
the courts may modify  in a number of ways  the level of risk which insurers had expected to assume including eliminating exclusions  expanding the terms of the contract  multiplying limits of coverage  creating rights for policyholders not intended to be included in the contract and interpreting applicable statutes expansively to create obligations on insurers not originally considered when the statute was passed 
courts have also undone legal reforms passed by legislatures  which reforms were intended to 
table of contents state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company reduce a litigant s rights of action or amounts recoverable and so reduce the costs borne by the insurance mechanism 
these court decisions can adversely affect an insurer s profitability 
they also create pressure on rates charged for coverages adversely affected  and this can cause a legislative response resulting in rate suppression that can adversely affect an insurer 
the terrorism act requires the federal government and the insurance industry to share in insured losses up to billion per year resulting from future terrorist attacks within the united states 
under the terrorism act  commercial property and casualty insurers must offer their commercial policyholders coverage against certified acts of terrorism  but the policyholders may choose to reject this coverage 
if the policyholder rejects coverage for certified acts of terrorism  the company intends  subject to the approval of the state regulators  to cover only such acts of terrorism that are not certified acts under the terrorism act and that do not arise out of nuclear  biological or chemical agents 
the requirement for insurers to make certain coverage available under the terrorism act originally extended through december  but congress has extended it through the end of the terrorism act will terminate on december   unless congress acts to extend it again 
the company has advocated the extension of this statute 
if the statute is allowed to sunset  the foregoing description would become inapplicable 
the company s current property reinsurance treaties exclude certified acts of terrorism 
if the terrorism act expires  those treaties will likely be revised to exclude acts of terrorism as defined within the treaties 
likewise  if the terrorism act expires  the company will pursue changes to its direct commercial policies to exclude acts of terrorism as defined within its policies 
an area of regulatory focus that arose late in  and which likely will continue to receive additional focus in  is producer compensation arrangements 
the new york attorney general has undertaken investigations and initiated lawsuits involving allegations of improper compensation arrangements between brokers and insurance companies 
these actions have led several state insurance departments to undertake their own surveys or inquiries into the activities of their domestic insurers with respect to producer compensation arrangements in their respective states 
two state insurance departments have delivered inquiries to the company  and the company has responded to each of the inquiries 
it is the company s understanding that these inquiries are part of an overall fact finding process initiated by these state insurance departments  and that similar inquiries were made to a number of other domestic insurers in these states 
the inquiries did not indicate or imply that the company had done anything improper with respect to its compensation arrangements with its agents 
because these inquiries are in their early stages of fact finding  it cannot be predicted as to the next phase of inquiry or what  if any  legislation or rules may be proposed to address producer compensation arrangements in those states where the company has domestic insurers 
the improper producer compensation arrangements generally involve insurance brokers  which are persons retained and compensated by the insurance customer 
the company markets its insurance products through independent insurance agents who have been appointed to act on the company s behalf  and the company  not the insurance customer  compensates these agents pursuant to contractual arrangements 
under its agency agreements  the company s compensation arrangements with its agencies consist of commissions paid for the sale of the company s insurance products  usually based upon a percentage of the premium paid by the insurance customer  and a contingent commission 
this contingent commission is based upon the underwriting profit generated by that agency s book of business placed with the state auto group 
like many other sales organizations  the company also offers sales incentives to its agencies 
the company believes that its agent compensation arrangements are in compliance with all laws and consistent with good business practices 
investments the company s investment portfolio is managed to provide growth of statutory surplus in order to facilitate increased premium writings over the long term while maintaining the ability to service current insurance operations 
the primary objectives are to generate income  preserve capital and maintain liquidity 
the company s investment portfolio is managed separately from that of mutual and its subsidiaries  and investment results are not shared by the pooled companies through the pooling arrangement 
stateco performs investment management services for the company and mutual and its subsidiaries  although investment policies implemented by stateco continue to be set for each company through the investment committee of its board of directors 
the company s decision to make a specific investment is influenced primarily by the following factors a investment risks  b general market conditions  c relative valuations of investment vehicles  d general market interest rates  e the company s liquidity requirements at any given time  and f the company s current federal income tax position and relative spread between after tax yields on tax exempt and taxable fixed income investments 
the company has investment policy guidelines with respect to purchasing fixed income investments which preclude investments in bonds that are rated below investment grade by a recognized rating service 
the maximum investment in any single note or bond is limited to of assets  other than obligations of the us government or government agencies  for which there is no limit 
investments in equity securities are selected based on their potential for appreciation as well as ability to continue paying dividends

competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with numerous insurance companies  many of which are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial resources 
in addition  because the company s products are marketed exclusively through independent insurance agencies  most of which represent more than one company  the company faces competition within each agency 
see marketing in the narrative description of business 
the company competes through underwriting criteria  appropriate pricing  quality service to the policyholder and the agent  and a fully developed agency relations program

table of contents state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet  revenues and expenses for the period then ended and the financial entries in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future  as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed therein 
losses and loss expenses payable are management s best estimates at a given point in time of what the company expects to pay claimants  based on known facts  circumstances and historical trends 
reserves for reported losses are established on either a case by case or formula basis depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 
the case by case reserve amounts are determined by claims adjusters based on the company s reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and policy provisions relating to types of loss 
the formula reserves are based on historical data for similar claims with provision for trend changes caused by inflation 
loss and loss expense reserves for incurred claims that have not yet been reported are estimated based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates  and economic conditions 
case and formula basis loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis  and as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves 
generally  reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis and not settled after six months  are case reserved at that time 
although management uses many internal and external resources  as well as multiple established methodologies to calculate reserves  there is no method for determining the exact ultimate liability 
acquisition costs  consisting of commissions  premium taxes  and certain underwriting expenses relating to the production of property and casualty business  are deferred and amortized ratably over the contract period 
the method followed for computing the acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
in determining estimated realizable value  the computation gives effect to the premium to be earned  losses and loss expenses expected to be incurred  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as premium is earned 
these amounts are based on estimates  and accordingly  the actual realizable value may vary from the estimated realizable value 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations are long term in nature and require management judgment in estimating the factors used to determine these amounts 
management  along with its defined benefit consulting actuary  reviews these factors  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets among other factors 
because these obligations are based upon management estimates which could change given available information  the ultimate benefit obligation could be different from the amount estimated 
fixed maturity and equity security investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
the unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are shown as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income  and as such are not included in the determination of net income 
investment income is recognized when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
the company regularly monitors its investment portfolio for declines in value that are other than temporary  an assessment that requires significant management judgment 
among the factors management considers are the nature of the investment  severity and length of decline in fair value  events impacting the issuer  and overall market conditions 
when a security in the company s investment portfolio has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  the company adjusts the cost basis of the security to fair value 
this results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss  which is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in other comprehensive income 
see a discussion of other factors that may have an impact on management s best estimates at impact of significant external factors included in this item note on reportable segments in june  mutual merged with meridian mutual insurance company meridian mutual  with mutual continuing as the surviving corporation 
with the merger  all insurance business written by meridian mutual legally became the business of mutual and was included in the pooling arrangement as of july  due to the integration efforts by management of the meridian book of business  on january   the meridian standard segment was included in the state auto standard segment  likewise  on january   the meridian nonstandard segment was included in the state auto nonstandard segment as these meridian segments no longer met the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as reportable segments

the investment management services segment reflects management of the investment portfolios of affiliate companies 
its significant source of segment profit is the fee generated from providing this service 
the relative stable improvement in profit over the years is attributable to the combined growth of the investment portfolios managed along with fair value improvement 
this segment s revenue is based on the average fair value of the portfolios managed 
a necessary discipline of a successful property and casualty insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit 
when underwriting is not profitable  premiums are inadequate to pay for insurance losses and related acquisition and operating expenses 
when an insurance company operates at an underwriting loss  net investment income may enable an insurance company to produce income 
however  if an underwriting loss persists over an extended period of time  the insurance company puts itself at risk as a going concern 
the company has consistently focused on this underwriting objective and therefore views its underwriting results as a critical component of its overall performance 
the company monitors the profitability of its insurance segments by utilizing certain components of segment profit that are characteristic within the property and casualty insurance industry  namely underwriting profit and combined ratio 
underwriting profit under statutory accounting principles sap is determined by subtracting from earned premiums  losses and loss expenses and net underwriting expenses incurred 
sap requires 
table of contents state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued all underwriting expenses to be expensed immediately and not deferred over the same period that the premium is earned 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap  however  permits the recognition of acquisition costs as the premiums are earned 
in converting sap underwriting results to gaap underwriting results  acquisition costs are deferred through the capitalization of deferred policy acquisition costs and amortized over the periods the related premiums written are earned 
see the discussion of deferred policy acquisition costs under critical accounting policies included in this item the gaap combined ratio is defined as the sum of the gaap loss and lae ratio loss and loss expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums plus gaap expense ratio acquisition and operating expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums 
when the combined ratio is greater than  the insurer is operating at an underwriting loss 
when the combined ratio is less than  the insurer is operating at an underwriting profit 
the following tables provide a reconciliation to the insurance segments gaap net underwriting profit loss  gaap combined ratio along with related segment net investment income  for the years  and  respectively

the unearned premium represents the deferred revenues of the unexpired terms of coverage which are earned ratably over the policy period 
thus  unearned premium is not fully recognized as premiums earned until the end of the policy period 
during each of and  the company s insurance segments attained then record level net underwriting profit while also incurring then record level catastrophe losses 
the gaap combined ratio improvements are the direct result of the company obtaining adequate cost based rates  re underwriting the former meridian mutual business applying state auto underwriting guidelines along with terminating unprofitable meridian programs 
management of the company continues to focus on growing premiums without compromising profitability 
the company s investment yield has 
table of contents state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued declined consistent with the decrease in long term interest rates 
the company invests for yield while maintaining a conservative approach for principal preservation 
during  the company debt issuance  net of debt repayments  was million 
the net proceeds of debt were used by state auto financial to contribute additional paid in capital to certain of its insurance subsidiaries to strengthen the statutory surplus position for support of continued premium growth and for general corporate purposes 
see below for additional discussion of the company s operations 
compared to net income before federal income taxes for the company increased million to million in from the most significant factors contributing to this increase were an improvement in the company s loss experience from along with growth in earned premium 
the company s gaap loss and lae ratio reflected a point improvement in from  despite being the largest catastrophe in dollars loss year in the company s history 
as discussed in more detail below  the company s challenge is to grow premiums without compromising profitability as industry wide price competition appears to be increasing

the consolidated earned premiums were affected by the stop loss 
the stfc pooled companies ceded million in earned premiums to mutual in  which reduced the company s earned premiums in by 
the stop loss reinsurance agreement expired december  and was not renewed 
as reflected in the table above  earned premiums increased from year to year across almost all lines of business  with the exception of nonstandard auto  commercial multi peril and workers compensation 
overall the composition of the company s book of business did not change significantly from year to year  with the standard auto personal line continuing to be the company s most significant line of business 
earned premiums within the standard segment increased million in from during and  the company took necessary and in some cases significant base rate increases  particularly within the meridian book  in almost all lines of business 
the impact of these base rate changes affects earned premium growth in the years following the implementation of these changes

while management utilizes each of these iris ratios in monitoring its operating performance on a statutory accounting basis  the net written premium to statutory surplus ratio the leverage ratio is monitored to ensure that each of the company s insurance subsidiaries continues to operate within the defined range of to the higher the leverage ratio  the more risk a company bears in relation to statutory surplus available to absorb losses 
in considering this range  management also considers the distribution of net premiums between property and liability lines of business 
a company with a larger portion of net premiums from liability lines should generally maintain a lower leverage ratio 
the statutory leverage ratios for the company at december   and are as follows statutory leverage ratios to state auto p c milbank farmers sa ohio sa national weighted average the company uses the statutory leverage ratio as there is no comparable gaap measure

finally  one exceptionally large liability claim added over to the other liability reserves in the current year development of the prior years ultimate liability does not reflect any changes in the company s fundamental claims reserving practices 
the company s internal actuarial staff conducts quarterly reviews of projected loss development information to assist management in making estimates of reserves for ultimate losses and loss expenses payable 
several factors are considered in estimating ultimate liabilities including consistency in relative case reserve adequacy  consistency in claims settlement practices  recent legal developments  historical data  actuarial projections  accounting projections  exposure growth  current business conditions  catastrophe developments  and late reported claims 
in addition  reasonableness tests are performed on measures of claim severity  loss ratio  and trend factors  all of which are implicit to the liability estimates 
losses and loss expenses payable is management s best estimate mbe at a given point in time of what the company expects to pay claimants  based on known facts  circumstances and historical trends 
reserves for reported losses are established by the company s claim division on either a case by case or formula basis depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 
the case by case reserve amounts are determined based on the company s reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and policy provisions relating to types of loss 
the objective of the claims division is to establish ultimate case reserves that are sufficient  but not excessive 
the formula reserves are based on historical data for similar claims with provision for trend changes caused by inflation 
loss and loss expense reserves for incurred claims that have not yet been reported ibnr are estimated based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates  and economic conditions 
case and formula basis loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis  and as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves 
generally  reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis and not settled after six months are case reserved at that time 
although management uses many resources to calculate reserves  there is no method for determining the exact ultimate liability 
management establishes a reserve for loss adjustment expenses contemplating functions and costs that are not attributable to a specific claim  which are called unallocated loss adjustment expenses ulae 
historical ratios of paid ulae to paid losses are developed  and then imposed on the current outstanding reserves 
the method uses a traditional assumption that of the expenses are realized when the claim is open  and the other are incurred as the loss payments are made 
the method also assumes that the underlying claims process and mix of business do not change drastically over time 
mbe for sa national and the stfc pooled companies share of the pooled companies losses and allocated loss expense reserve loss and alae reserve at december  is million  compared with an actuarial point estimate of million that is within a projected range of million to million 
these values presented are on a direct basis  gross of salvage and subrogation recoverable  and before reinsurance  except for the stfc pooled companies participation in the intercompany pooling arrangement 
therefore the company cautions the reader that these values cannot be compared to other loss and loss expenses payable tables included elsewhere within this form k 
reserve ranges provide a quantification of the variability in the reserve projections  which is often referred to as the standard deviation or error term  while the point estimates establish a mean  or expected value for the ultimate reserve 
mbe of loss reserves considers the actuarial point estimate and expected variation to establish an appropriate position within the range 
the potential impact of loss reserve variability on net income is quantifiable using the range end points and carried reserve amounts listed above 
for example  if ultimate losses reach the high point of million  the reserve increase of million is an after tax decrease of million on net income 
likewise  should losses decline to the low end of million  the million reserve decrease would add million of after tax net income 
an important assumption underlying the reserve estimation methods for the major casualty lines is that the loss cost trends implicitly built into the loss and alae patterns will continue into the future 
to estimate the sensitivity of reserves to an unexpected change in inflation  projected calendar year payment patterns were applied to the december   other liability loss and alae payable to generate estimated annual incremental loss and alae payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  for purposes of sensitivity testing  an additional annual loss cost trend of two percent was added to the trend implicitly embedded in the estimated payment pattern  and revised incremental loss and alae payments were calculated 
this type of inflationary jump could arise from a variety of sources including tort law changes  development of new medical procedures  social inflation  and other inflationary changes in costs beyond assumed levels 
the estimated cumulative impact that this additional  unexpected two percent increase in the loss cost trend would have on our results of operations over the lifetime of the underlying claims in other liability is an increase of million on reserves  or a million after tax reduction assuming a tax rate of to net income 
inflation changes have much more impact on the longer tail commercial lines like other liability and workers compensation  and much less impact on the shorter tail personal lines reserves 

table of contents state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued the following table provides a reconciliation of mbe of the company s direct loss and alae reserve to the company s net loss and loss expenses payable at december  the stfc pooled companies net additional share of transactions assumed from mutual through the pooling arrangement for the year has been reflected in the table below as assumed by stfc pooled companies millions mbe direct loss and alae reserve stfc pooled companies  national and mid plains assumed by stfc pooled companies total direct loss and alae reserve direct unallocated loss adjustment expense ulae stfc pooled companies  national and mid plains assumed by stfc pooled companies total direct ulae direct salvage and subrogation recoverable stfc pooled companies  national and mid plains assumed by stfc pooled companies total direct salvage and subrogation recoverable reinsurance recoverable assumed reinsurance reinsurance assumed by stfc pooled companies total losses and loss expenses payable  net of reinsurance recoverable on losses and loss expenses payable of alae are those costs that can be related to a specific claim  which may include attorney fees  external claims adjusters  and investigation costs  among others 
ulae are those costs incurred in settling claims  such as in house processing costs  for which no identification can be made to specific claims 
alae and ulae comprise the loss expense portion of the total loss and loss expenses payable 
the risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates include  but are not limited to  actual settlement experience being different from historical data and trends  changes in business and economic conditions  court decisions creating unanticipated liabilities  ongoing interpretation of policy provisions by the courts  inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and additional information discovered before settlement of claims 
the company s results of operations and financial condition could be impacted  perhaps significantly  in the future if the ultimate payments required to settle claims vary from the liability currently recorded 
in the preceding paragraphs  the company has offered a description of certain factors management considers in estimating the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses 
with respect to the auto line of business  which represents almost half of the company s total reserves  perhaps the most significant external variable is legal developments 
as discussed in impact of significant external factors below  court decisions have a significant impact on the property and casualty insurance industry 
some of these decisions have a more prospective effect as  for example  when contract provisions relating to third party coverages are construed in ways not anticipated by the company 
other court decisions may have more of a retroactive effect which may be seen more clearly in the auto insurance line 
auto insurance tends to be a line of business more regulated by statutes  consequently  the courts tend to have more of an opportunity to construe and apply those statutes to existing contracts 
uninsured motorists and underinsured motorists collectively um are statutory coverages in almost every state where the company does business 
when courts of appeal construe um statutes adversely to the company and the industry  the effect of that decision is typically retroactive  because  legally speaking  when the court interprets a statute it is as though the statute was always construed in the manner that the court determined 
this retroactive effect is exacerbated in um cases and other first party coverage cases because the statute of limitations applicable to um claims and other first party coverages can be as long as years 
claims that had been closed or not even presented  going back as long as fifteen years  can be re born by an adverse court decision 
the company considers the impact of adverse court decisions of which it has become aware when it sets ultimate loss and lae reserves for auto insurance as well as other lines to the extent those lines may be retroactively affected by such matters 
the effect of court decisions is also apparent in the commercial lines of coverages such as commercial multi peril and other liability and products liability 
courts can expand coverage or void exclusions which can increase the company s exposure to claims 
some of these third party claims may still be brought within the statute of limitations applicable to such third party claims and expose the company to some retroactive liabilities 
these liabilities are sought to be addressed by the ultimate loss and lae reserve that is the company s estimate of loss and loss expenses payable 
it is not feasible to quantify the impact of judicial decisions that may have retroactive effect because the company cannot foresee  among the range of issues that are litigated every day in courts in each state in which the company does business  which cases will be decided adversely and how such decisions will actually apply to the company 

table of contents state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued the property and casualty industry has had significant loss experience from claims related to asbestos  environmental remediation  product liability  mold and other mass torts 
asbestos reserves are million  and environmental reserves are million  for a total of million  or of net reserves 
because the company has insured primarily product retailers and distributors  not manufacturers  incurred losses have not been significant from asbestos and environmental claims activity 
the reserve estimates do not contemplate substantial loss from any mass torts  including those already listed above  or others not known at this time 
in addition  there is no provision in the reserves for a major retroactive expansion of coverage through judicial interpretation 
if these assumptions prove to be incorrect  ultimate liabilities could increase substantially 
the company s claims  underwriting  and actuarial staff track separately all claims within the family of mass torts  and respond accordingly as information becomes known 
a tabular presentation of the current year million favorable development broken down by accident year is shown below derived from the company s and  year loss development table  as presented in the reserves section of the company s form k  narrative description of business section 
the development is measured in dollars and as a percentage of the total december   net loss and loss expense payable current year of development millions of ultimate liability total net loss and accident redundancy loss expenses year deficiency payable and prior total in management s opinion  the current year development  given the breakdown by accident year  is well within normal expectations for reserve development and claim settlement uncertainty

table of contents state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued the company s actuarial department derived expected payment patterns separately for the direct loss and alae reserves 
these patterns were applied to the december   loss and alae payable to generate estimated annual incremental loss and alae payments for each subsequent calendar year 
these amounts are based on historical payment patterns and do no represent actual contractual obligations 
the actual payment amounts and the related timing of those payments could differ significantly from these estimates

under the modified prospective method  unvested stock based awards  that were granted prior to adoption  will continue to be accounted for in accordance with statement except the compensation cost attributable to the unvested portion of the awards must be recognized in the income statement 
awards that are vested will not be recognized in the income statement 
under the modified retrospective method  prior periods are restated by recognizing compensation cost in the amounts previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under statement the company has not elected a transition method 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  impact of significant external factors inflation can have a significant impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amount of losses and loss expenses are known 
when establishing rates  the company attempts to anticipate increases from inflation subject to the limitations of modeling economic variables 
general inflation  as measured by the cpi  has been relatively modest over the last several years  however  price inflation on the goods and services purchased by insurance companies in settling claims has been steadily increasing 
in particular  repair costs for homes  autos  and commercial buildings  and medical care costs  have risen disproportionately over the last few years 
costs for building materials typically rise dramatically following substantial natural catastrophes such as the industry experienced in florida and adjacent states in the company continues to adjust its pricing projections as loss cost trends change in order to ensure premiums keep pace with inflation in all lines of business 
the company considers inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss expenses are management s best estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of high inflation  the normally higher yields on investment income may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses 
the company is also affected by court decisions 
premium rates are actuarially determined to enable an insurance company to generate an underwriting profit 
these rates contemplate a certain level of risk 
the courts may modify  in a number of ways  the level of risk which insurers had expected to assume including eliminating exclusions  multiplying limits of coverage  creating rights for policyholders not intended to be included in the contract and interpreting applicable statutes expansively to create obligations on insurers not originally considered when the statute was passed 
courts have also undone legal reforms passed by legislatures  which reforms were intended to reduce a litigant s rights of action or amounts recoverable and so reduce the costs borne by the insurance mechanism 
these court decisions can adversely affect an insurer s profitability 
they also create pressure on rates charged for coverages adversely affected  and this can cause a legislative response resulting in rate suppression that can adversely affect an insurer 
the company may also be adversely affected by regulatory actions on matters within the jurisdiction of the various insurance departments where the company does business or has entities domiciled 
after credit scoring  the industry s use of which has been limited to varying extents by certain states laws  the next most predictive underwriting report available to insurers is previous loss information 
third party vendors obtain loss information from insurers based on the insured  the vehicle and or the property location 
as insurers write new business the database is accessed to analyze any loss experience of the insured  vehicle and or property location 
many times insurer s premium rates will be adjusted to reflect the loss experience accessed from these databases 
in some cases the overall acceptability of the insured s application in the standard market may be determined by these reports 
during the last few years  use of this loss information database product by the insurance industry as a predictive underwriting tool has been challenged by several west coast states and most recently in a few of the company s states of operation 
while it is too soon to determine states reaction to the utilization of these database systems  any restrictive regulation of the full use of these underwriting reports could have an adverse impact on the company as it has utilized these database systems for several years as an underwriting tool 
since such regulation is applicable to all companies writing business which utilize these reports  the company does not expect to suffer a competitive disadvantage 
the terrorism risk insurance act of the terrorism act established a temporary federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism committed by or on behalf of a foreign interest 
in order for a loss to be covered under the terrorism act  it must be the result of an event that is certified as an act of terrorism by the us secretary of treasury subject losses 
in the case of a war declared by congress  only workers compensation losses are covered by the terrorism act 
the terrorism insurance program the program generally requires that all commercial property casualty insurers licensed in the us participate in the program 
the amount of compensation paid to participating insurers under the program is of subject losses  after an insurer deductible  subject to an annual cap that limits the amount of subject losses to billion aggregate per program year 
the company s deductible under this federal program is approximately million for  subject to final rules to be established by the us treasury 
under the terrorism act  commercial property and casualty insurers 
table of contents state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued must offer their commercial policyholders coverage against certified acts of terrorism  but the policyholders may choose to reject this coverage 
if the policyholder rejects coverage for certified acts of terrorism  the company intends  subject to the approval of the state regulators  to cover only such acts of terrorism that are not certified acts under the terrorism act and that do not arise out of nuclear  biological or chemical agents 
this is currently scheduled to sunset at year end if it does not continue in place  none of the foregoing would be applicable and each carrier would have to make its own decisions with respect to terrorism insurance 
the company s current property reinsurance treaties exclude certified acts of terrorism 
if the terrorism act expires  those treaties will likely be revised to exclude acts of terrorism as defined within the treaties 
likewise  if the terrorism act expires  the company will pursue changes to its direct commercial policies to exclude acts of terrorism as defined within its policies 
trends and uncertainties the company has identified certain trends and uncertainties that have the potential to significantly affect the company s business and the property and casualty insurance industry 
the company considers these risks in the management of the company operations increased price competition increased price competition can have the effect of decreasing the rate of growth of earned premiums  as well as decreasing earned premiums  as the company s underwriting philosophy is not consistent with risk selection at a price below which management believes is adequate 
declining investment rate of return and volatile investment market the declining investment rate of return can decrease the rate of growth of investment income  as well as decrease investment income and net income 
the company invests for an adequate return with a focus on principal preservation risk 
the volatile investment market and related investment valuation can affect the insurers statutory surplus and stockholders equity as the fair value of investments fluctuates 
increased frequency and severity of storm losses  including catastrophes and increasing health care costs the increased frequency and severity of storm losses and rising health care costs can have the effect of increasing losses and decreasing operating profits 
while the company does not write health care insurance  rules affecting health care services can affect other insurance that is written by the company  including workers compensation and commercial and personal automobile and liability insurance 
management considers these trends and uncertainties in the writing and pricing of policies 
because of the company s growth and planned greater geographic dispersion of risk  the loss ratio point impact of recent catastrophes has not been as severe as catastrophe losses several years ago that had fewer loss dollars associated with them 
increased consolidation of the property and casualty insurance industry consolidation continues within the property and casualty insurance industry which can increase competition by creating insurance companies with more resources and capital 
as demonstrated over the years  the company has acquired and successfully integrated insurance companies in the past and considers acquisition opportunities as they arise 
the company believes acquisitions will be an important part of its growth strategies 
changing product distribution channels company management monitors the changing product distribution channels  along with its changing relationships with agencies and consolidation occurring within the agency distribution system itself 
the company remains committed to cultivating strong relationships with its agencies and to selling insurance products through the independent agency system 
new and changing insurance risks such as asbestos  mold  silica and acts of terrorism the company considers the expanding scope of insurance risks  such as asbestos  mold  silica and acts of terrorism  in its pricing  writing of policies and drafting policy forms 
bad faith claims in at least two of the states where the company does business  the law permits a plaintiff claimant to bring an action directly against the company  as opposed to its insured  for third party bad faith 
this right creates a certain amount of negotiating leverage for plaintiffs in those states that might not otherwise exist and presents an exposure to loss to the company 
business continuity planning the company has established a business continuity plan in an effort to ensure the continuation of core business operations in the event that normal business operations could not be performed due to a catastrophic event 
while the company continues to test and assess its business continuity plan to ensure it meets the needs of the company s core business operations and addresses multiple business interruption events  there is no assurance that core business operations could be performed in the occurrence of such an event 

table of contents state auto financial corporation and subsidiaries a majority owned subsidiary of state automobile mutual insurance company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued forward looking statements  certain factors affecting future results statements contained in this form k or any other reports or documents prepared by the company or made by management may be forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those projected 
forward looking statements may be identified  preceded by  followed by  or otherwise include  without limitation  words such as plans  believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  or similar expressions 
the following factors  among others  in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the company s actual financial performance 
the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for losses and loss expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability  but instead represent estimates  generally using actuarial projection techniques at a given accounting date 
the company refines reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled 
the company records adjustments to reserves in the results of operations for the periods in which the estimates are changed 
because establishing reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established reserves may not be adequate 
if the company concludes that estimates are incorrect and reserves are inadequate  the company is obligated to increase its reserves 
an increase in reserves results in an increase in losses and a reduction in the company s net income for the period in which the deficiency in reserves is identified 
accordingly  an increase in reserves could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
the company s insurance operations expose it to claims arising out of catastrophic events 
the company has experienced  and will in the future experience  catastrophe losses that may cause substantial volatility in the company s financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce the company s profitability or harm the company s financial condition 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural events  including hurricanes  hailstorms  windstorms  earthquakes  explosions  severe winter weather  and fires  none of which are within the company s control 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
the geographic distribution of the company s business subjects it to catastrophe exposure from hailstorms and earthquakes in the midwest as well as catastrophe exposure from hurricanes in florida and the gulf coast  southern coastal states  and mid atlantic regions 
the company does have in place very specific underwriting guidelines designed to provide spread of risk and control aggregate exposures in those areas most exposed to natural catastrophes 
catastrophe losses can vary widely and could significantly exceed the company s recent historic results 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
the company uses reinsurance to help manage its exposure to insurance risks 
the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions  both in terms of price and available capacity  which can affect the company s business volume and profitability 
although the reinsurer is liable to the company to the extent of the ceded reinsurance  the company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured 
as a result  ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate the company s obligation to pay claims 
the company is subject to credit risk with respect to the company s ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers 
reinsurance may not be adequate to protect the company against losses and may not be available to the company in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
in addition  the magnitude of losses in the reinsurance industry resulting from catastrophes may adversely affect the financial strength of certain reinsurers  which may result in the company s inability to collect or recover reinsurance 
insurance companies are subject to financial strength ratings produced by external rating agencies 
higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a strong ability to pay claims 
ratings are assigned by rating agencies to insurers based upon factors that they believe are relevant to policyholders 
ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in the company and in its ability to market its products 
a downgrade in the company s financial strength ratings could  among other things  negatively affect the company s ability to sell certain insurance products  the company s relationships with agents  new sales  and the company s ability to compete 
the company markets its insurance products through independent  non exclusive insurance agents  whereas some of the company s competitors sell their insurance products through insurance agents who sell products exclusively for one insurance company 
if the company is unsuccessful in attracting and retaining productive agents to sell the company s insurance products  the company s sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the agents that market and sell the company s products also sell the company s competitors products 
these agents may recommend the company s competitors products over the company s products or may stop selling the company s products altogether
