management s discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial condition as of march  and  the consolidated results of operations for the years ended march   and and  where appropriate  factors that may affect future financial performance 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in the form k 
page forward looking statements the reader is urged to read the information contained in the forward looking statements section at the beginning of this report for a discussion of the use of forward looking statements in this report as well as risks and uncertainties in attempting to predict our future performance based upon such statements 
overview we are a financial services holding company that  primarily through our subsidiaries  provides broker dealer  investment advisory  asset management  financial planning  insurance and related services 
we operate in a highly regulated and competitive industry that is influenced by numerous external factors such as economic conditions  marketplace liquidity and volatility  monetary policy  global and national political events  regulatory developments  competition and investor preferences 
our revenues and net earnings may be either enhanced or diminished from period to period by any one of or by a multiple of these external factors 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
these critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  understanding these policies is important to understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the company 
valuation of securities and other assets substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
these include cash  cash equivalents  securities purchased under agreements to resell  deposits with clearing organizations  securities owned  and securities sold but not yet purchased 
in accordance with fas  certain financial instruments are classified as trading and available for sale 
the realized gains and losses are recorded in the income statement in the period in which the transactions occurred 
the unrealized gains and losses related are reflected in other comprehensive income depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument 
where available  the company uses prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer price quotations 
fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
in addition  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for instance  the company generally assumes that the size of positions in securities that the company holds would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if the company were to sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value

page off balance sheet risk the company is engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose counterparties primarily include the general public 
in the event that counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  the company may be exposed to risk 
securities sold  but not yet purchased  represent obligations of the company to purchase the security in the market at the prevailing prices to the extent that the company does not already have the securities in its possession 
accordingly  these transactions result in off balance sheet risk when the company s satisfaction of the obligations exceeds the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or issuer of the instrument 
it is the company s policy to review  as necessary  the credit standings of each counterparty with which it conducts business

receivable from our mutual funds per sfas  management assesses the ability to collect mutual fund receivables 
if management determines that it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the dollar amount can be determined  management will create a provision for that amount

reserves the company records reserves related to legal proceedings in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an employee or representative of the company  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law 
each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge credit to earnings in that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual disposition of a legal proceeding could be greater or less than the reserve amount

the presidential election  the war in iraq  rising energy costs  and a potential increase in interest rates created skepticism within the financial service sector  however  the company  through it s recruiting process  continued to attract sophisticated representatives who offered a broad and diversified product base to clients 
as a result  the company was able to obtain an increase in overall sales even during difficult market conditions 
page the effect of recruiting suitable representatives is demonstrated in the preceding revenue table 
sales of mutual funds and variable annuities  as a percentage of revenue  decreased to in fiscal year compared to for the previous year 
on the other hand  sales from trading  as a percentage of revenue  increased from to compared to the prior year  and advisory services sales  as a percentage of revenue  increased from to 
by recruiting representatives who are licensed to sell a variety of investments that meet the needs of their clients  we achieved a significant shift of sales towards higher margin products 
this contributed to an increase in the overall profit margin 
the gross margin table illustrates that sales in mutual funds and variable annuities generated on average a margin retention during the last three full fiscal years  whereas sales from trading produced profit margin retentions of  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
even more tellingly  advisory services sales for those three years yielded an average margin retention of 
gross margins we experienced an increase in advisory services revenues of compared to only a increase for years versus gross margin contribution in advisory services went from million in to million in we have enhanced our advisory services model by implementing ica s advisory service program  an advisor directed asset managed program that accounted for most of the greatest increase in advisory sales 
gross margins from trading experienced a decrease compared to an increase of for the years versus after growing from million to million for the years versus  the margin contribution from trading declined to million in as the result of several factors 
in fiscal year we had a net trade error of approximately  in addition  a number of our representatives increased sales through our online trading platform 
these representatives tend to execute fewer  but higher volume  trades than our other representatives  resulting in less ticket revenue for the company 
also  these representatives generally command a higher payout 
in light of the increases in trading sales volume and assets under management  we will continue to focus our attention on recruiting high level and experienced representatives to improve our overall profit margin and at the same time meet the financial needs of our clients 
payouts to representatives payouts to representatives in commissions  advisory  and other fees have held steadily at approximately of sales for the comparative years  and management continually monitors and adjusts its payout structure accordingly 
operating expenses advertising 
advertising expenses increased by approximately over the previous year due to added marketing efforts that are necessary to promote the company and enhance its brand name recognition 
the national presence of the corporation has demanded a wider scope of advertising 
additionally  travel and its associated costs have been required in order to support our marketing efforts 
page communications 
communications expenses increased by approximately over the past year due to costs in the areas of printing  investor public relations  website infrastructure  conferences  and telephone 
these expenses are heavily correlated with growth in the company and its overall business activity 
compensation and benefits 
compensation and benefits expenses increased by over the past year due to our commitment to place individuals with strong industry expertise into positions of leadership where essential decisions can be formed 
on an overall basis  additional compensation benefits allow the company to grow and provide better service 
regulatory  legal and professional 
regulatory  legal and professional expenses increased by approximately over fiscal with the growth in our broker dealer  advisory  and asset management business  and the associated regulatory scrutiny commonplace in the industry  the company had increased its utilization of professional services 
the company remitted full payment during on a sizeable liability related to regulatory matters  thus fully satisfying its related obligations 
the overall current market risk of the industry is a factor that remains uncertain 
management believes that costs related to regulatory  legal and professional activities can be stabilized in the future under an improved overall investment environment and increasingly effective risk management 
occupancy 
occupancy expenses increased by approximately over the past year due to increases in rent and depreciation of fixed assets 
as the company continues to expand  additional fixed asset expenditures may be required 
other administrative 
other administrative expenses decreased by approximately over the past year  demonstrating that the company is controlling operating expenses related to company wide items 
the other administrative expense categories include various insurance items  postage  office expenses  and computer maintenance operating income operating income declined from million  or of revenues  to million  or of revenues  compared to operating income had increased in as compared to because the company benefited from implementing fixed operating overhead initiatives  including technology and web based reporting that enhanced the automation of commission statements and autonomous trade processing through our online trading platform 
in contrast  this year we made a substantial financial commitment to acquire seasoned personnel  including senior management with extensive and responsible industry expertise  in an effort to increase sales  particularly by restructuring the company s product mix to emphasize the advisory services sector 
management will continue to refine our business model  particular regarding recruitment of key personnel and growing the advisory services sector  with a view to improve operating income and earnings per share 
net income in comparative years and  net income decreased by approximately thousand  or per basic share and per diluted share 
in an ever changing and increasingly competitive environment  our long term plan is to increase net income and earnings per share on a sustainable basis 
key to this effort will be to continue attracting and servicing high quality  professional representatives who will enable us to efficiently exploit our market niche  grow assets under management  and increase our overall profitability 
page liquidity and capital resources we believe that achieving our return on equity goals requires the efficient use of capital 
historically  we have financed our operations primarily with private equity and internally generated cash flow 
as of march   cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately million compared to million as of march  working capital as of march  was million compared to million as of march  our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to as of march  compared to to as of march  as of march   the net capital ratio for icc  the broker dealer subsidiary  was to compared to to for our fiscal year ended march  the sec uniform net capital rule rule c requires that the company maintain a net capital of  and a ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital not to exceed to this sec requirement is also referred to as the net capital ratio or the net capital rule 
indebtedness generally includes all money owed by a company  and net capital includes cash and assets that are easily converted into cash 
sec rules also prohibit equity capital which  under the net capital rule  includes subordinated loans from being withdrawn  cash dividends from being paid and other specified actions of similar effect from being taken  if  among other specified contingencies  our net capital ratio would exceed to or if we would have less than of our minimum required net capital 
as of march   the company had net capital of approximately million compared to net capital of million as of march  this resulted in excess net capital of million and million  respectively 
the company continues to generate a positive cash flow from operating activities 
the company generated cash flow from operations of million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
cash inflows as a result of the company s profitability of million  million and million  respectively  have continued to provide the company s largest source of cash during said comparative years 
cash outflows for the year came most notably from payment of income taxes in the amount of million 
we also paid out thousand in corporate insurance policies  thousand for equipment and technology and thousand in loans to registered representatives to foster sales growth 
finally  we paid off a note to nasd in the amount of thousand 
icc made a business decision in fiscal year to conclude an nasd investigation into supervisory procedures relating to the period of january through july of while we considered disputing the allegations in a formal proceeding  we estimated the cost of doing so to be prohibitive 
furthermore  we sought to avoid disruption of our home office and other operations 
accordingly  while neither admitting nor denying the allegations  we consented to a number of findings in order to resolve the matter in its initial stages 
repayment of the settlement note to nasd did not have a material effect on cash flow at any time during the comparative years of  and the company has implemented and maintains an adequate system of supervisory and regulatory procedures and does not foresee any material deficiencies in the future in this regard
