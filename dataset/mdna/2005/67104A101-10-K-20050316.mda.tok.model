item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation restatement of financial statements we began a review of our lease accounting policies following announcements beginning in december that several restaurant companies were revising their accounting practices for leases 
as a result of our review  we have changed our lease accounting in  and we have restated certain historical financial information for prior periods to correct errors in our lease accounting policies 
the restatement adjustments are non cash and had no impact on revenues or net operating cash flows 
we do not consider the differences in prior years annual financial statements to be material 
changes to our lease accounting policies include adjusting lease terms  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended  to include option renewals that are reasonably assured of being exercised  including the straight line effect over the lease term of escalating rents during the option periods and recognizing the effect of pre opening rent holidays over the related lease terms 
these restatement adjustments reduced net income by   and  and diluted earnings per share by   and for the years ended december   and  respectively  and resulted in a  reduction in retained earnings as of december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information on restatement adjustments 
the effects of the restatement are included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we did not amend our previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the restatement  and the financial statements and related financial information contained in such reports should no longer be relied upon 
overview we are one of the largest casual dining restaurant companies in the world  with eight restaurant concepts  over  system wide restaurants and annual revenues for company owned stores exceeding billion 
we operate in all states and in countries internationally  predominantly through company owned stores  but we also operate under a variety of partnerships and franchises 
our primary focus as a company of restaurants is to provide a quality product together with quality service across all of our brands 
this goal entails offering consumers of different demographic backgrounds an array of dining alternatives suited for differing needs 
our sales are primarily generated through a diverse customer base  which includes people eating in our restaurants as regular users who return for meals several times a week or on special occasions such as birthday parties  private events and for business entertainment 
secondarily  we generate revenues through sales of franchises and ongoing royalties as well as the sale and redemption of gift certificates 
the restaurant industry is a highly competitive and fragmented business  which is subject to sensitivity from changes in the economy  trends in lifestyles  seasonality customer spending patterns at restaurants are generally highest in the first quarter of the year and lowest in the third quarter of the year and fluctuating costs 
operating margins for restaurants are susceptible to fluctuations in prices of commodities  which include among other things  beef  chicken  seafood  butter  cheese  produce and other necessities to operate a store such as natural gas or other energy supplies 
additionally  the restaurant industry is characterized by a high initial capital investment  coupled with high labor costs 
the combination of these factors underscores our initiatives to drive increased sales at existing stores in order to raise margins and profits  because the incremental sales contribution to profits from every additional dollar of sales above the minimum costs required to open  staff and operate a store is very high 
we are not a company focused on growth in the number of restaurants just to generate additional sales 
our expansion and operation strategies are to balance investment costs and the economic factors of operation  in order to generate reasonable  sustainable margins and achieve acceptable returns on investment from our restaurant concepts 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview continued promotion of our outback steakhouse and carrabba s italian grill restaurants is assisted by the use of national and spot television and radio media  which we have also begun to use in certain markets for our bonefish grill brand 
we advertise on television in spot markets when our brands achieve sufficient penetration to make a meaningful broadcast schedule affordable 
we rely on word of mouth customer experience  grassroots marketing in local venues  direct mail and national print media to support broadcast media and as the primary campaigns for our upscale casual and newer brands 
we do not attempt to lure customers with discounts  as is common to many restaurants in the casual dining industry 
our advertising dollars are targeted to promote and maintain brand image and develop consumer awareness 
we strive to drive sales through excellence in execution rather than through discounting and other short lived marketing efforts 
our marketing strategy of getting people to visit frequently and also recommending our restaurants to others complements what we believe are the fundamental elements of success convenient sites  service oriented employees and flawless execution in a well managed restaurant

our financial results included growth of consolidated revenues by to billion  which includes million in revenues from acquired stores or stores consolidated as a result of a new accounting pronouncement  decline of net income by to million  new unit openings across all brands  and average unit volume increases at all concepts restaurants open for one year or more  with the exception of cheeseburger in paradise 
sales increases were driven by new unit openings and increases in average unit volumes 
our strategy in the past year included expansion of our newer concepts  particularly cheeseburger in paradise  fleming s prime steakhouse and wine bar and bonefish grill 
we also focused additional spending on prime time broadcast media for our core outback steakhouse brand 
curbside takeaway is an increasing percentage of our total sales  and is adding incrementally to our overall sales  while not significantly reducing in store visits 
our international outback steakhouse operations grew average unit volumes by and profits before taxes by  which was the result of targeted attempts to translate our brand into local consumer preferences  primarily in the asian markets 
south korea continues to be our largest and most profitable international region and will continue to be an opportunity for growth 
in  our results were affected by the growth of our newer brands 
as we continue to develop and expand new restaurant concepts at different rates  our cost of sales  restaurant operating expenses and income from operations change from the mix of brands in our portfolio with slightly different operating characteristics 
labor and related expenses are higher at our new format stores than have typically been experienced at outback steakhouses 
however  cost of sales at those stores is lower than those at outback 
these trends are expected to continue with our planned development of stores in
