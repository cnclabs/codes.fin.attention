critical accounting policies and items affecting comparability quality financial reporting relies on consistent application of company accounting policies that are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial statements and often require management judgment and estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
when such judgments and estimates are required  all material developments and resolutions are discussed with our audit committee 
revenue recognition and work in process monster 
our monster division primarily earns revenue from the placement of job postings on the websites within the monster network  access to the monster network s online resume database and other ancillary services 
we recognize revenue at the time that job postings are displayed on the monster network websites 
revenue earned from subscriptions to the monster network s resume database is recognized over the length of the underlying subscriptions  typically from two weeks to twelve months 
revenue associated with multiple element contracts is allocated based on the relative fair value of the services included in the contract 
unearned revenues are reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
advertising communications 
our advertising communications division derives revenue for job advertisements placed in newspapers  internet career job boards such as monster and other media  plus associated fees for related services 
revenue is recorded net of media placement costs  which are passed on to the customer 
revenue is generally recognized upon placement date for newspapers and other print and offline media 
online media revenue is recognized when services are purchased 
directional marketing 
our directional marketing division derives revenue from the placement of advertisements in telephone directories yellow pages advertising 
revenue for yellow pages advertisements are recognized on the publications closing dates and are recorded net of publisher advertising costs  which are passed on to the customer 
direct operating costs incurred that relate to future revenue for yellow pages advertisements  are deferred recorded as work in process in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and subsequently charged to expense when the directories are closed for publication and the related commission is recognized as income 
in addition  we earn revenue from mortgage companies  real estate firms and other companies that place advertisements on our online relocation portal  monstermoving 
revenue derived from such advertisements is recognized over the stated terms of fixed contracts  or upon referral to advertisers on our website for performance based contracts 
merger  integration  restructuring and business reorganization and spin off plans we have recorded significant charges and accruals in connection with our merger  integration  restructuring and business reorganization and spin off plans 
these accruals include estimates pertaining to future lease obligations  employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations resulting from our actions 
our accruals for future lease obligations include estimates of sublease income and can extend for several years  depending on the terms of each lease 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of our customers 
changes in required reserves may occur due to changing circumstances  including changes in the current market environment or in the particular circumstances of individual customers 
we assess the recoverability of accounts receivable by performing a specific account review of significant customer accounts and applying general reserve percentages based on historical collection experience to the remaining population of customer accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts approximates of our accounts receivable portfolio as of december  a change in the calculation of bad debt reserves for the year ended december   would have impacted the allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately million 
business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets we account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition 
our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of an acquisition and are not restated 
the costs to acquire a business  including transaction costs  are allocated to the fair value of net assets acquired upon acquisition 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the judgments that we make in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact net income in periods following a business combination 
for material purchase acquisitions  we often use independent valuation specialists to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives 
we evaluate our goodwill annually for impairment  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units 
changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require reductions to recorded amounts of intangible assets 
based on impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of goodwill for the years ending december  and  respectively 
we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of tax  which is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as a cumulative effect of accounting change for the year ended december  results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data and cash flow information in thousands year ended december  statement of operations data revenue monster    advertising communications    directional marketing    total revenue    total operating expenses operating income loss    income loss from continuing operations before accounting change  net income loss    cash flow information cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations  cash used for investing activities of continuing operations  cash provided by used for financing activities of continuing operations cash used for discontinued operations    effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  constant currencies we define the term constant currency to be a comparison of financial information from period to period that excludes the effect of translating foreign currencies to us dollars at differing exchange rates 
changes in our revenues and core operating expenses  which we identify as salaries and related  office and general  and marketing and promotion expenses  include the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because they are translated at average exchange rates for each period  as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that these calculations are a useful measure  providing additional detail about the change in operations from period to period 
earnings from subsidiaries are rarely repatriated to the united states and there are no significant gains or losses on foreign currency transactions between subsidiaries 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates generally impact only reported earnings

we began advertising campaigns in the top us markets in in order to capture a larger piece of what we believe to be a billion help wanted advertising market for small and medium sized business 
in addition  we maintained our emphasis on providing a high level of customer service and were able realize higher client retention rates than in the prior period 
in north america  our operations posted strong organic growth and we began to see signs of a stable labor environment evidenced by a significant increase in orders booked by our sales staff versus the prior period 
we also continued to see an improvement in our european operations where we are witnessing increased migration toward on line employment and recruitment tools 
our european operations also benefited in from our acquisition of jobpilot gmbh in april and a weaker us dollar 
all of our acquisitions  which were made to expand our monster network  contributed million of revenue to monster for the year ended december  core operating expenses at the monster division increased primarily due to the addition of approximately sales staff across north america  europe and the asia pacific region and the effect of acquisitions completed in acquisitions contributed million to our core operating expenses for the year ended december  in addition  we continued to promote and market the monster brand globally 
we increased and redirected portions of our marketing and promotion expense in to attract higher quality traffic to our website and compete head to head with local newspapers in the top metropolitan markets in the united states 
amortization of intangibles was up significantly in the period due to the four acquisitions that we made in in total  we recognized million of amortizable intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions and expect amortization expense relating to current intangible asset balances to be approximately million in advertising communications the operating results of our advertising communications division for the years ended december  and are as follows year ended december  increase decrease in thousands revenue    salaries and related  office and general  marketing and promotion amortization of intangibles business reorganization  spin off costs and other special charges total operating expenses    operating loss    advertising communication s revenue increased primarily due to stronger help wanted print advertising in north america compared to the prior period 
with the discontinuation of our advertising communications businesses in continental europe  revenue in north america now comprises of the segment s business in  while europe and asia pacific account for and  respectively 
we continue to incentivize our advertising communications division to promote and cross sell monster services 
as a result  the division recognized approximately million and million of commissions on monster sales of million and million for the periods ending december  and  respectively 
revenue in the period also increased million as a result of a weaker us dollar 
the weaker us dollar in increased core operating expenses by million  which was partially offset by lower corporate and technology costs charged to the division and lower amortization expense 
the division s north american business was profitable as it focused on and made significant operational improvements to bring costs in line with revenues in the period 
in december  we exited our advertising communications business in certain countries in continental europe in order to focus our efforts more fully on our monster operations 
we intend to continue the efforts that began in late  and improve the cost structure of our remaining european operations  which are now primarily located in the united kingdom 
directional marketing the operating results of our directional marketing division for the years ended december  and are as follows year ended december  increase decrease in thousands revenue    salaries and related  office and general  marketing and promotion amortization of intangibles business reorganization  spin off costs and other special charges total operating expenses    operating income loss    revenue in our directional marketing division decreased in  primarily as a result of lower ad placement volume and a higher number of yellow page directory closings in the period 
we continued to see directory closings shift beyond expected close dates in into the division generated operating income in due to lower core operating expense levels related to our yellow pages services as we undertook measures to re engineer the cost and management structure of the division 
in addition to reducing the number of employees in the division and consolidating certain offices  we sold us motivation  which was not a strategic fit to our directional marketing division 
total operating expenses and operating income consolidated operating expenses for the years ended december  and are as follows year ended december  increase decrease in thousands salaries and related    office and general    marketing and promotion    business reorganization  spin off costs and other special charges amortization of intangibles    total operating expenses    operating income    the increase in consolidated operating expenses is primarily due to increased headcount at monster  higher bonus accruals as internal operating targets were exceeded  increased marketing expenditures in north america and europe  acquisitions and foreign currency translation rates 
in addition  our office and general expenses increased as we incurred additional professional fees  primarily related to accounting and sarbanes oxley compliance and higher depreciation expense versus the period 
our marketing and promotion expenses increased as a result of increased monster branding efforts across each of our geographic regions 
acquisitions completed in contributed million to the increase in our consolidated operating expenses 
amortization expense was higher in the period due to intangibles valued in connection with our purchase acquisitions  particularly for jobpilot and tickle 
in addition  the higher operating expenses include a million increase as a result of a weaker us dollar in income taxes income taxes for the years ended december  and are as follows year ended december  increase decrease in thousands income from continuing operations before income taxes   income taxes    effective tax rate our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of state and local taxes  certain nondeductible including integration  business reorganization and spin off costs in  foreign earnings taxed at different tax rates and valuation allowances 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  our filed tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes

in addition  we introduced new revenue generating services that are vertically compatible with monster and were targeted toward the stronger sectors of the economy  such as the workforce of small and medium sized businesses  government and healthcare 
in july  we acquired quickhire  inc quickhire  which further strengthened our position in the government sector  particularly within the larger agencies of the federal government 
quickhire generated million of revenue for the monster division during the second half of increases in the division s revenue were offset by lower revenue in our european operations  partially due to office closings in scandinavia in the first quarter of also included in the monster division s revenue is million and million for and  respectively  of revenue earned from cross selling with our former staffing division  now the staffing division of hh group 
the monster division s core operating expenses were a lower percentage of revenue in as a result of our reorganization plans and decreased spending on marketing and promotion 
partially offsetting our cost cuts were increased costs to further develop vertical markets  such as government and healthcare  and an increase in our sales staff in the latter part of the year 
in addition  operating margins improved as a result of lower merger  integration  business reorganization and spin off costs 
advertising communications the operating results of our advertising communications division for the years ended december  and are as follows year ended december  increase decrease in thousands revenue    salaries and related  office and general  marketing and promotion amortization of intangibles merger  integration  business reorganization  spin off costs and other special charges    total operating expenses    operating loss    the decrease in advertising communications revenue is primarily related to the global decline in newspaper job placement advertising reflecting the effects of weak economies as well as continuous migration away from traditional recruitment advertising and toward online career solutions 
we saw signs of stability in the division s revenue base near the end of and continue to focus our efforts on selling monster services to clients of our advertising communications division  however we do not anticipate that the print recruitment advertising market will return to its previous levels as we continue to see a migration away from help wanted advertising in newspapers toward online career solutions 
core operating expenses decreased significantly on a constant currency basis in when compared to the prior year period  as we reduced the number of employees in the division and consolidated offices in an effort to bring our cost structure in line with the declining revenue base 
because of the level of uncertainty surrounding a significant rebound in the newspaper help wanted advertising market  we are carefully monitoring the cost structure of our advertising communications division and have focused our attention on additional revenue generating initiatives 
directional marketing the operating results of our directional marketing division for the years ended december  and are as follows year ended december  increase decrease in thousands revenue    salaries and related  office and general  marketing and promotion amortization of intangibles merger  integration  business reorganization  spin off costs and other special charges    total operating expenses    operating loss    directional marketing revenue decreased in  as a result of lower demand for advertising on our monstermoving 
com website  while the yellow pages advertising business was relatively flat compared to the prior year 
we continued to see pricing pressure on yellow pages advertising commissions by both publishers and our clients 
the division s operating margins decreased due to higher core operating expense levels related to our yellow pages services as we undertook measures to re engineer the cost and management structure of the division 
in addition to reducing the number of employees in the division and consolidating certain offices  we incurred incremental costs to automate our customer response management system  which is intended to streamline our sales process and order entry system

although our core operating expenses were higher by million in  it was mainly as a result of rising foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the british pound and the euro 
when compared to the prior year  currency translation rates increased our core operating expenses by million 
we devoted significant resources toward bringing our expense levels lower in  as evidenced by the decrease in core operating expenses on a constant currency basis 
the constant currency decrease in core operating expenses was partially offset by higher salaries at the monster division due to additional sales force  the acquisition of quickhire  and higher sales commissions due to stronger revenue in the second half of the year 
in addition  re engineering the structure of our directional marketing division had a temporary incremental effect on salaries in the fourth quarter of the increase in office and general expenses in includes a million increase as a result of a weaker us dollar in  investments in new monster services  such as networking and government services  and technology spending in directional marketing  which are all offset by company wide cost cutting efforts 
marketing and promotion in the year ended december  decreased primarily due to the timing of our marketing spending in our monster division 
merger and integration expenses reflect costs incurred in the period as a result of pooling of interests transactions and the planned integration of such companies 
this expense includes office integration costs  the write off of fixed assets that will not be used in the future  separation pay  professional fees  and employee stay bonuses to certain key personnel of the merged companies

in addition  because of recent business acquisitions and our and reorganization initiatives  we have substantial cash commitments over the next several years 
these commitments as of december  are as follows amounts in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years payable to hudson highland group  inc borrowings under financing arrangement and other notes payable capital lease obligations   operating lease obligations     acquisition notes payable    total      substantially all of the current portion of acquisition notes payable listed in the table above will be paid in the first quarter of while lease obligations will be paid ratably over the course of the year 
in addition  subsequent to december   we paid million of cash  representing our investment for of chinahr 
com  and announced our acquisition of emailjob 
com in france for million cash  million of which will be paid prior to march  we also have other long term liabilities for which maturity dates are not currently estimable or do not necessarily require a cash or equity commitment 
in addition  certain of our prior acquisitions contain earn out provisions based on pre determined financial goals that could require further cash commitments 
historically  we have relied on funds provided by operating activities  equity offerings  short and long term borrowings and seller financed notes to meet our liquidity needs 
we invest our excess cash predominantly in money market funds  overnight deposits  and commercial paper that are highly liquid  of high quality investment grade  and have maturities of less than three months with the intent to make such funds readily available for operating and strategic long term equity investment purposes 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million as of december  cash balances as of december  and exclude the effect of million and million  respectively  of outstanding checks in excess of cash balances  which are classified as current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
these outstanding checks typically represent publisher payments  payroll and other contractual obligations disbursed on or near the last day of a reporting period 
such payments are disbursed from a financial institution separate from that of our depository accounts 
our increase in cash of million in the year ended december   primarily relates to the operating and financing activities of our continuing operations  offset by net cash used in investing activities 
cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  was a result of million of net income  which included million of net non cash items  decreased by a million change in working capital items in our continuing operations 
we also used million of cash in the operating activities of our discontinued operations 
increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue are mainly due to our success in driving more business to monster and the slightly improved economic environment in  as we have recognized a substantial improvement in both revenue and income levels from the prior year 
decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses include payments made to yellow pages directory publishers  lower accruals for advertising costs and million in payments to hh group in in addition  we made cash payments of million related to our business reorganization and spin off costs 
we used million of cash for investing activities in the year ended december  cash used reflects million of payments  net of cash acquired  for our acquisitions of jobpilot including related integration and restructuring charges  military advantage and tickle 
included in our payments for acquisitions is million to former owners of other acquired businesses  based on pre determined financial goals 
in addition  we funded million to dispose of our advertising communications businesses in europe in we also used million of cash for capital expenditures in uses of cash in investing activities were offset by million of net proceeds that we received on the sale of our us motivation subsidiary in october cash provided by financing activities reflects our january  stock offering on which we raised million by issuing million shares of our common stock 
we generated million of cash from employee stock option exercises due to our rising stock price  particularly in the latter part of cash provided by financing activities also contains million payments on debt and capitalized lease obligations 
our debt balances increased significantly in as a result of our business combination transactions 
part of our acquisition strategy has been to pay portions of the purchase prices over time 
these amounts are normally pre determined at the acquisition date or are based on the achievement of certain financial goals 
in the year ended december   total debt increased by million  mostly related to guaranteed consideration in connection with our tickle and military advantage acquisitions and the earn out associated with our acquisition of quickhire 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  revolving credit facility and cash we anticipate to generate from operating activities will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements and commitments through at least the next twelve months 
our cash generated from operating activities is subject to fluctuations in the global economy  unemployment rates and the demand for yellow pages advertising 
recent accounting pronouncements on october   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas r  share based payment  which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments  including employee stock options  at fair value 
the statement is effective for all public companies for interim or annual periods after june  the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
the standard also requires that the modified prospective transition method be used  which would necessitate us to recognize compensation cost for the fair value of new awards granted  modified or settled after the effective date of the proposed statement 
in addition  the measurement of compensation cost for awards that are non vested as of the effective date of the proposed statement would be based on the same estimate that we used to previously account for its grants under sfas as a result  we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated statement of operations within our footnotes  as is current practice 
in addition  the proposed standard may impact our consolidated cash flows from operations as  under this proposed standard  we will be required to reclassify our tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options from cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from financing activities 
the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options currently included within cash flows from operating activities for the twelve months ended december  and was  and  respectively 
we are currently assessing the potential impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and are evaluating alternative equity compensation arrangements

as a result  our primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  variability in interest rate spread relationships ie  prime to libor spreads and exchange rate variability 
on january   we amended and restated the terms of our secured revolving credit facility

we use forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to offset risks related to foreign currency transactions 
these transactions primarily relate to non functional currency denominated inter company funding loans and non functional currency accounts receivable 
we do not trade derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we also conduct operations in more than foreign countries  including australia  belgium  canada  china  france  germany  ireland  india  italy  japan  the netherlands  new zealand  sweden  spain  and the united kingdom 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenue was earned outside the united states and collected in local currency and related operating expenses were also paid in such corresponding local currency 
accordingly  we will be subject to risk for exchange rate fluctuations between such local currencies and the dollar 
the financial statements of our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using current rates of exchange  with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account  a component of stockholders equity 
during the year ended december   our cumulative translation adjustment account increased million  primarily attributable to the weakening of the us dollar against the the euro  the swedish krona and the british pound
