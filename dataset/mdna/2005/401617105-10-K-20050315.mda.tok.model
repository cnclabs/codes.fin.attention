it communicates a distinctive image that is fun  fashionable and sexy 
brand loyalty  name awareness  perceived quality  strong brand images  public relations  publicity  promotional events and trademarks all contribute to brand integrity

for  our goal for this acquisition  which closed on january   is to add approximately million in revenues and to be slightly accretive to earnings 
retail store strategy and expansion plans 
our retail growth strategy is to increase retail sales and profitability by expanding our network of retail stores and improving the performance of existing stores

our retail locations build brand awareness and contribute to market penetration and growth of the brand in concert with our wholesale operations

we continue to be very selective with new store locations and expect to open approximately new stores in  consisting of full price retail and factory outlet stores  in addition to the new concept stores 
in addition  we plan to remodel or relocate approximately stores 
we also plan to close approximately five stores in in  total sales in the us and canada at our stores open for at least one year also called comparable store sales increased by from levels 
we believe the increase in comparable store sales is attributable to our commitment to several ongoing initiatives  including leadership in new product development  a more fashion focused product mix  improvements in merchandising and visual presentation  the remodeling of select stores to promote a consistent brand message  a new retail store inventory allocation system  the introduction of the marciano line and the development of a motivated team of sales professionals to service our customers and provide a favorable shopping experience 
the look and feel of guess retail and factory outlet stores play an important role in building our brand equity 
to enhance the quality of our presentation  we remodeled or relocated stores during and plan to remodel or relocate approximately stores during as part of our retail growth strategy we are also placing additional emphasis on our accessories line and marciano line  which replaced our guess collection line in this includes greater focus on these products in our existing stores as well as developing new concept stores in order to exclusively feature these products 
during  we opened new concept stores  consisting of five marciano and six accessories stores 
while it is still early  and we plan to monitor the performance of these stores carefully  we are encouraged by the response we are seeing 
these new store concepts leverage our brand recognition and the reputation we have for sexy  contemporary styling to extend our brand into new areas 
the marciano brand is attracting a slightly older  more sophisticated customer  while the accessories stores are enabling us to build a more meaningful presence in this high margin segment 
we are targeting customers who already shop guess stores but are looking for an expanded accessories presentation  as well as new customers who did not shop guess in the past 
continue to develop licensee portfolio and expand international business 
one of our primary objectives is to maintain the quality and reputation of the guess brand 
in order to accomplish this goal  we will continue to strategically reposition our licensing portfolio by constantly monitoring and evaluating the performance of our licensees worldwide and their strength and capabilities to appropriately represent our brand 
as part of this process  we will consider bringing in house apparel licenses  where appropriate  or license lines which we produce as we did with our kids business in if we determine that licensees are performing inadequately  we will  from time to time  discontinue the existing relationship and seek out a stronger replacement licensee 
as previously mentioned  on december   we entered into an agreement with fingen spa and fingen apparel spa  to acquire the remaining of the shares not already owned by the company of maco  the italian licensee of guess jeanswear for men and women in europe  as well as the assets and leases of certain retail stores in europe 
in  we signed a new shoe license with marc fisher llc to develop  manufacture  and distribute athletic and fashion footwear under the guess trademark in the us and several countries worldwide

we will continue to strategically examine opportunities to expand our licensee portfolio by developing new licensees that can expand our brand penetration and compliment the guess image 
we believe there are significant growth opportunities in international markets 
we are working closely with our international licensees and distributors to develop these opportunities and to expand the availability of the guess brand throughout the world 
in  we granted a new license to manufacture and distribute children s clothing in certain territories of europe 
improved product sourcing 
over the past several years  we have refocused our product sourcing strategies to increase efficiencies  reduce costs and improve quality 
we currently purchase approximately of our finished products from international vendors  primarily in asia and mexico 
this is a significant change from years ago when we purchased the majority of our goods from domestic sources 
we have increased our utilization of lower cost  offshore packaged purchases in which we supply the product design and fabric selection  and the vendor manufactures and delivers the finished product 
we have strategically aligned ourselves with sourcing vendors worldwide  who will take full responsibility for delivering quality  finished products in a timely manner 
by continuing to use these packaged programs  we believe we can improve product gross margins  reduce carrying costs of raw materials and improve the timing of our deliveries and product quality 
we also retain a close relationship with a number of domestic vendors located primarily in los angeles as we believe it is important to react to last minute trends as well as to respond to rush reorders 
logistics 
in  we opened an automated distribution center in louisville  kentucky to replace the distribution center in los angeles as our primary distribution center 
this  square foot facility is near united parcel service s national transit hub and has contributed to the reduction of our shipping time to our stores and wholesale accounts that are east of the mississippi river 
depending on processing volumes and productivity improvements  we expect that we will continue to reduce operating cost per unit by reducing handling costs in the new facility and will provide better service to our customers by faster shipping and reduced response times 
as of december   this facility was approximately utilized 
we focused on all aspects of our supply chain in and expect to continue in this has included the implementation of new systems such as the installation of an automated product sorter machine in the kentucky distribution center in the fourth quarter of which should improve operating efficiencies through automation 
these systems  along with other actions we are taking  should result in lower processing and freight costs in the future

competition the apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented  and is subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and preferences

we compete with numerous apparel manufacturers and distributors and several well known designers that have recently entered or re entered the designer denim market 
our retail and factory outlet stores face competition from other retailers  including some of our major wholesale customers 
our licensed apparel and accessories also compete with a substantial number of designer and non designer lines and various other well known brands 
many of our competitors  including the gap  abercrombie fitch  dkny  polo ralph lauren and tommy hilfiger  among others  have greater financial resources than we do

this improvement resulted in a increase in net revenues to million in from million in the company also increased its profitability in with net earnings of million compared with net earnings of million in the company has seen significant improvement in its balance sheet with continued emphasis on reducing inventory levels and improving cash flow 
during the year  inventory was reduced by even though product sales increased by 
with strong cash management and improving operating performance  the company also reduced total borrowings by million or during the year and increased cash and restricted cash by million by year end 
our retail segment  including full priced retail  factory outlet  canada  and e commerce  generated net sales of million during  an increase of  from million in the prior year 
this growth was driven by a comparable store sales increase of and a larger store base  which represented a increase in average square footage as compared to the comparable store sales increase reflects the improved results of both the men s and women s lines and our accessories business 
in addition to strong same store sales growth  our retail stores also increased their margins and managed expenses effectively to deliver a substantial improvement in operating results 
one of our key growth strategies focuses on the development of our new marciano line 
this line was previously labeled as guess collection and was rebranded as marciano in the third quarter of the new assortment commands higher price points and it targets a more upscale  contemporary customer 
the marciano line is available in approximately of our full price retail stores in the us and canada 
we also opened five marciano stores in the second half of that feature this line exclusively 
we also began testing a new accessories store concept in we believe we offer unique positioning in the marketplace with a well recognized brand name at a more accessible price point than the luxury accessory brands 
we opened six accessories stores in the second half of  which range in size between  and  square feet 
in the fourth quarter of  management decided to exit the kids store business 
at december   there were three kids retail stores and one kids factory store still open 
as of february  we had closed one of these kids stores and intend to close two additional kids stores by year end 
we do not expect the closings and the charges related thereto to have a significant impact on operating results 
while we are still experiencing challenges in our wholesale segment  we have seen some improvements in domestic gross margins and in our international operations 
the wholesale segment revenues for increased to million from million in international wholesale revenue increased by million in compared to in the fourth quarter of  we announced the proposed acquisition of our european jeanswear licensee 
negotiations were completed in the fourth quarter and the transaction closed in january  we expect this transaction will add approximately million in revenues and be slightly accretive to earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect our wholesale business to grow in primarily reflecting the acquisition of our european jeanswear licensee 
our products were sold domestically in approximately doors at the end of compared with approximately doors at the end of our licensing segment performed well with increased revenues of million compared to million in we had licensees at the end of as compared to at the end of licensing operating earnings increased to million in from million in the company has continued to make investments to improve operating efficiencies and inventory management 
to this end  we implemented a new manufacturing system to gain further operating efficiencies through automation 
this system  along with other actions we are taking  should result in improved product visibility and lower processing and freight costs 
in addition  a new inventory allocation system we are rolling out is resulting in improved inventory turnover and in stock positions in the stores  and is contributing to higher store sales volumes with less inventory 
application of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories  accounts receivable allowances  the useful life of assets for depreciation  restructuring expense and accruals  evaluation of impairment  recoverability of deferred taxes and evaluation of net recoverable amounts and accruals for the sublet of certain lease obligations 
the company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
accounts receivable reserves in the normal course of business  the company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers  after a credit analysis based on financial and other criteria 
accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments 
the company bases its allowances through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collections trends and an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to net revenues  and are included in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
these costs result from seasonal negotiations with the company s wholesale customers  as well as historic trends and the evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out and weighted average method or market 
the company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving current product as well as prior seasons inventory 
market value of non current inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for this category of inventory of the company s individual product lines  the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
the company closely monitors its off price sales to ensure the actual results closely match initial estimates 
estimates are regularly updated based upon this continuing review 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of its long lived assets ie  goodwill  and property and equipment  which requires the company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the assets are considered to be impaired if the company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the company s strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred 
if the assets other than goodwill are assessed to be recoverable  they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
fair value is determined based upon the undiscounted cash flows derived from the underlying asset 
litigation reserves estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation 
both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation is uncertain 
as additional information becomes available  the company will assess the potential liability related to pending litigation and will revise estimates as appropriate 
such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position

in addition  royalties received from international licensees are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations as a result of the net sales of the licensee being denominated in local currency and royalties being paid to the company in usd
