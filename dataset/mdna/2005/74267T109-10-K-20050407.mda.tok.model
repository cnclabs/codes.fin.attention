item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except share and per share data overview we are a development stage company engaged in research and development of drug technologies to enable targeted delivery of chemotherapy drugs 
we intend initially to reformulate existing widely used chemotherapies with our proprietary carbohydrate compounds 
we believe our technology may increase the body s tolerance to these toxic drugs by targeting the delivery directly to cancerous cells and increasing the efficacy  thereby creating a preferable treatment to existing oncology regimens 
our goal is to develop and commercialize a new generation of reformulated drugs 
for additional information  please see item business business of pro pharmaceuticals 
all of our drug candidates are currently in pre clinical and clinical development 
to commercialize our drug candidates  we will be required to successfully complete pre clinical studies and clinical trials to obtain regulatory approvals 
we do not expect to file a new drug application nda for a drug candidate before  even if development of our drug candidates continues successfully 
any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals will materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from commercial sales relating to our drug candidates 
we expect our sources of funding for the next several years to come from finance transactions 
we are devoting substantially all of our efforts toward product research and development  and raising capital 
we have no source of revenue and have incurred significant losses to date 
we have incurred net losses of  for the cumulative period from inception july  through december  our losses have resulted principally from costs associated with research and development expenses  including clinical trial costs  and general and administrative activities 
as a result of planned expenditures for future research  discovery  development and commercialization activities  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we have raised  in capital principally through the issuance of convertible notes  the sale of common stock through a public offering and the sale of common stock and warrants through private placements 
from inception july  through december   we used cash of  for our operations 
at december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents available to fund future operations  which our management believes is sufficient to fund our operations through at least march  because we lack revenue and must continue our research and development  we must continually identify new sources of capital and complete financing transactions in order to continue our business 
we must continually monitor the monthly burn rate of our capital resources 
we have expanded our management team with the hiring  as of february   of a full time chief financial officer who has substantial experience with public company financial accounting and reporting 
his predecessor served us on a consulting basis through december new accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

the statement requires companies to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas no

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  and in part iv  item exhibits and financial statement schedules 
certain of our accounting policies  however  are critical to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  which subjects them to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying our accounting policies  our management uses its best judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information available from other outside sources  and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
we believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve more complex management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset  liability  revenue and expense amounts 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation to employees and non employee directors in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense is recorded for stock options and restricted stock awards granted at fair market value with fixed terms 
we account for stock or other equity based compensation to non employees utilizing the fair value method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and the emerging issues task force abstract no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services  and the related interpretations 
under the fair value method  compensation is recorded at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument until the final measurement date  which is the earlier of performance completion or vesting 
fluctuations in the quoted market price of the our stock covered by the unvested equity instrument are reflected as adjustments to deferred compensation and compensation expense over the related service period 
we determine the fair value of the equity instrument by using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to make certain assumptions 
some of the assumptions  such as the risk free interest rate  come from published sources 
other assumptions  such as the expected life of the equity instrument or the expected volatility of our stock  are subjective and may differ from period to period 
accordingly  changes in the value of our stock or changes in the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the equity instruments  such as the expected life of the options  could have a significant effect on our results of operations in any period 
we consider equity compensation to be an important component in attracting and retaining key employees 
during and  we awarded approximately  and  stock options  respectively  to employees and non employee members of our board of directors for normal services 
because the exercise price of the options granted equal the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant and the options have fixed terms  we recorded no stock compensation expense on these awards 
if we had used the fair value method provided for under sfas no 
our reported net loss of  would have increased by to  in accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that third parties have performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include contract service fees  such as amounts paid to clinical research organizations cro and investigators in conjunction with pre clinical and clinical trials  and professional service fees  such as attorneys and accountants 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual services incurred by the service providers 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services or costs of such services  our reported expenses for a reporting period could be understated or overstated 
the date on which certain 
table of contents services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of services are often subject to our judgment 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
income taxes 
we determine if our deferred tax assets and liabilities are realizable on an ongoing basis by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  as necessary 
in the determination of the valuation allowance  we have considered future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets for which we previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  in or an increase of as compared to  incurred in research and development expenses consist primarily of costs of clinical research organizations cro  clinical data management services  outsourcing product development to chemical research laboratories regulatory and medical consultants  drug manufacturing for clinical trials  salaries  stock based compensation and other personnel related expenses 
of the  increase  approximately was due to phase i clinical trials of davanat fu and the remainder was due to drug manufacturing for clinical trials  pre clinical product development and cro costs primarily for phase ii clinical trials 
we began our phase i clinical trial of davanat and davanat fu in february due to additional drug administration cycles  enrollment closed in january we completed the sixth and final cohort of the phase i trial in march and expect to issue a report of the final clinical results in the second quarter of we initiated our phase ii clinical trial of davanat fu colorectal cancer patients in january  and are currently completing our negotiations and contracts with clinical sites 
we expect to begin dosing patients in the second quarter of and expect phase ii to be completed in we continue to develop our pipeline of drug candidates 
accordingly  we expect that our research and development costs will increase in due to phase ii clinical trial of davanat fu and preparation for phase iii combined with development of additional drug candidates 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  in or an increase of  as compared to  in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries including stock based compensation  legal and accounting fees  insurance  investor relations  business development and other office related costs 
of the  increase in costs in  approximately  was due to higher legal fees offset by lower expenses in other areas 
approximately of the legal fee increase was incurred in connection with the arbitration between glycogenesys  inc and david platt concerning rights to control prosecution of some patent applications that dr 
platt licensed to glycogenesys 
in november the arbitrator awarded the patent prosecution rights to dr 
platt 
we consider the costs incurred on this matter to be ordinary and necessary for purposes of protection of our intellectual property in general and to enable us to defend the claims against our intellectual property alleged by glycogenesys described in item legal proceedings above 
the remainder of the increase in legal costs was incurred principally for the protection of our intellectual property 
legal expenses in also increased to a lesser degree by expenditures to defend the lawsuit asserted by a former employee described in item legal proceedings above 
additionally  investor relations expense increased by approximately this increase was offset by lower stock based compensation expense of approximately the lower stock based compensation expense was 
table of contents primarily due to fewer compensatory option grants 
we expect legal costs in will remain at about the same level as the arbitration with glycogenesys and the former employee wrongful discharge lawsuits have now been concluded 
we expect the reduction in expenses related to these concluded matters to be offset by an increase related to the defense of our davanat patent lawsuit brought by glycogenesys 
we expect the remainder of general and administrative costs to increase modestly due to increased business activity and costs associated with being a public company 
interest and other income 
interest and other income in was or an increase of as compared to in interest and other income consists primarily of interest income on interest bearing cash equivalents 
the increase in interest income is due to higher average cash balances resulting from larger financings in  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
average interest rates were approximately per annum in versus approximately per annum in fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  in  or higher than the  incurred in the increase reflects the costs to initiate and conduct the phase i clinical trial of davanat fu  which began in february we expect the phase i trial to be completed in in  we began a concurrent phase ii clinical trial of davanat fu 
we are continuing to develop our pipeline of additional drug candidates 
accordingly  we expect that our research and development costs will continue to increase in and thereafter and could comprise a higher percentage of our annual expenditures 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  in  or higher than the  incurred in the increase in costs in was primarily due to the significant expansion of our business development activities and to costs associated with further strengthening our finance functions  including the addition of a financial expert on the audit committee of our board of directors and a chief financial officer 
approximately of the increase in costs was due to stock based compensation charges  primarily relating to options granted to consultants serving in business development capacities and our former chief financial officer who resigned in october we have since secured the services of a new chief financial officer on a consulting basis who remained until december  and was succeeded by a full time chief financial officer as of february  interest and other income 
interest and other income was in compared to in and primarily consists of interest income on short term investments 
the increase in interest income is due to higher average cash balances as we raised approximately  in new financing in compared to  in average interest rates in were approximately basis points below the average interest rates in interest expense 
interest expense was in compared to in the decrease in interest expense in is due to the lower debt balances as the convertible notes payable were converted into common stock or repaid in and approximately of the interest expense in represented the fair value of warrants issued to placement agents in connection with the debt offering and the fair value of shares of common stock issued to the holders of of convertible notes as consideration for our extension of the maturity date beyond december  liquidity and capital resources in thousands as described above in the section entitled overview above and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we are in the development stage and have not generated any revenues to date 
since our inception on july   we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of convertible debt  shares of common stock and warrants  and a public offering of shares of common stock 
to date  we have raised a total of  from these offerings and had  of cash available at december  
table of contents net cash used in operations increased to  in  from  in and  in  respectively 
the increased use of cash in operations is primarily due to the impact of a full year s research and management costs for the phase i clinical trial of approximately  drug manufacturing for clinical trials  pre clinical product development and cro costs primarily for phase ii clinical trials of approximately  and higher legal costs related primarily to the patent arbitration and intellectual property litigation described in item legal proceedings above of approximately net cash used in investing activities was approximately in  in and in of the used in approximately was related to new patents and the remainder was related to furniture and equipment for office expansion 
fixed asset purchases were higher in and as we added staff and relocated to new offices 
with the build out substantially completed  fixed asset purchases in are not expected to increase over the level 
patent costs increased in and due to the continued development of our drug research and development 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in   in and  in net cash provided by financing activities in resulted from the sale of common stock and warrants through two private equity offerings  structured as pipe transactions private investment in public equity 
in  the net cash provided by financing activities resulted from the sale of common stock and warrants in three private placements with net proceeds of  in  the net cash provided by financing activities resulted from one private placement and one public offering of common stock with net proceeds totaling  in addition  approximately of convertible notes outstanding at december  were converted into common stock in and the balance of the convertible notes of were repaid in cash 
we believe that our cash on hand of  at december  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our financing and operating obligations through at least march  we will require more cash to fund our operations and believe that we will be able to obtain additional financing 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such new financing or  if available  that such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
payments due under contractual obligations in thousands the following table summarizes the payments due under our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years clinical trial and related scientific contracts operating leases total payments due under contractual obligations in connection with the operating lease for our office space in newton  massachusetts included in the table above  a commercial bank has issued a letter of credit collateralized by cash we have on deposit with the bank of approximately the letter of credit expires on may   and we expect to renew it for an additional months 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not a party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

table of contents risk factors that may affect future results an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information before deciding to invest in our common stock 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
we have attempted to identify below the major factors that could cause differences between actual and planned or expected results  but we cannot assure you that we have identified all of those factors 
if any of the following risks actually happen  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in this case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to pro pharmaceuticals dollar amounts in thousands we are at an early stage of development with limited operating history 
we are a development stage company with a limited operating history  and we have not generated any revenues to date 
we have no therapeutic products available for sale  and none are expected to be commercially available for several years  if at all 
we may never generate revenue or become profitable  even if we are able to commercialize any products 
we have incurred net losses to date and depend on outside capital 
our accumulated deficit as of december  was  we will need to continue to conduct significant research  development  testing and regulatory compliance activities that  together with projected general and administrative expenses  we expect will result in substantial operating losses for the next several years 
accordingly  we will not be generating sales or other revenue and will remain dependent on outside sources of financing during that time 
if we are unable to raise funds from outside sources for our continuing operations  we may be adversely affected 
we may raise such capital through public or private equity financings  partnerships  debt financings  bank borrowings  or other sources 
additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
if adequate funds are not otherwise available  we may need to significantly curtail operations 
to obtain additional funding  we may need to enter into arrangements that require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies  products and or potential markets 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity  or securities convertible into equity  our equity holders may experience dilution of their proportionate ownership of the company 
based on  of available cash and cash equivalents as of december   we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our operations through at least march  our product candidates will be based on novel unproven technologies 
our product candidates will be based on novel unproven technologies using proprietary carbohydrate compounds in reformulations of drugs currently used in the treatment of cancer and other diseases 
carbohydrates are difficult to synthesize  and we may not be able to synthesize carbohydrates that would be usable as delivery vehicles for the anti cancer drugs we plan to work with 
our drug candidates are in clinical trials and results are uncertain 
we have one product candidate in human clinical trials 
pre clinical results in animal studies are not necessarily predictive of outcomes in human clinical trials 
clinical trials are expensive  time consuming and may not be successful 
they involve the testing of potential therapeutic agents  or effective treatments  in humans  typically in three phases  to determine the safety and efficacy of the product candidates necessary for an approved drug 
many products in human clinical trials fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy characteristics 
even if our products progress successfully through initial human testing  they may fail in later stages of development 
we will be dependent on others to conduct our clinical trials  including clinical research organizations and  possibly  government sponsored agencies 
these trials may not start or be completed as we forecast  or may be unsuccessful 

table of contents our product candidates may not be successfully commercialized 
even if our product candidates are successful in clinical trials  they may not be successfully commercialized 
potential products may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  be uneconomical to produce  fail to achieve market acceptance  or be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties 
our lack of operating experience may cause us difficulty in managing our growth 
we have limited experience in manufacturing or procuring products in commercial quantities  conducting other later stage phases of the regulatory approval process  selling pharmaceutical products  or negotiating  establishing and maintaining strategic relationships 
any growth of our company will require us to expand our management and our operational and financial systems and controls 
if we are unable to do so  our business and financial condition would be materially harmed 
if rapid growth occurs  it may strain our operational  managerial and financial resources 
we will depend on third parties to manufacture and market our products 
we do not have  and do not now intend to develop  facilities for the manufacture of any of our products for clinical or commercial production 
accordingly  we will need to develop relationships with manufacturers and enter into collaborative arrangements with licensees or have others manufacture our products on a contract basis 
we expect to depend on such collaborators to supply us with products manufactured in compliance with standards imposed by the fda and foreign regulators 
in addition  we have limited experience in marketing  sales or distribution  and we do not intend to develop a sales and marketing infrastructure to commercialize our pharmaceutical products 
if we develop commercial products  we will need to rely on licensees  collaborators  joint venture partners or independent distributors to market and sell those products 
we depend on key individuals to develop our products and pursue collaborations 
we are highly dependent on dr 
david platt  president and chief executive officer  dr 
anatole klyosov  a member of our scientific advisory board and a consultant  and dr 
eliezer zomer  vice president  manufacturing and product development 
the loss of any of these persons  or failure to attract or retain other key personnel  could prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products and core technologies 
we are a counterclaim defendant in a lawsuit instituted by dr 
platt 
dr 
platt filed a lawsuit in massachusetts in january against glycogenesys  inc for claims including breach of contract 
in its answer glycogenesys named us as a counterclaim defendant alleging tortious interference and misappropriation of proprietary rights  and seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief related to our intellectual property 
in march  we answered the counterclaim and denied any liability 
we and dr 
platt intend to contest these counterclaims vigorously 
if we do not prevail there could be a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risks related to the drug development industry we will need regulatory approvals to commercialize our products 
we currently do not have products approved for sale in the us or any foreign market 
we are required to obtain approval from the fda in order to sell our products in the us and from foreign regulatory authorities in order to sell our products in other countries 
the fda s review and approval process is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
extensive pre clinical and clinical data and supporting information must be submitted to the fda for each indication for each product candidate in order to secure fda approval 
the fda could reject an application or require us to conduct additional clinical or other studies as part of the regulatory review process 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain fda approvals would prevent or delay the commercialization of our products  which would prevent  defer or decrease our receipt of revenues 
if we receive initial regulatory approval  our product candidates will be subject to extensive and rigorous ongoing domestic and foreign government regulation 

table of contents our competitive position depends on protection of our intellectual property 
development and protection of our intellectual property are critical to our business 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to practice our technologies 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products or processes in the united states and other countries  protect trade secrets  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
since patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy for at least portions of their pendency periods published on us patent issuance or  if earlier  months from earliest filing date for most applications and since other publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that we are the first to make the inventions to be covered by our patent applications 
the patent position of biopharmaceutical firms generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
the us patent and trademark office has not established a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims that it will allow in biotechnology patents 
we cannot assure you that all of our patent applications will issue as patents or that the claims of any issued patents will afford meaningful protection for our technologies or products 
in addition  patents issued to us or our licensors may be challenged and subsequently narrowed  invalidated or circumvented 
patent litigation is widespread in the biotechnology industry and could harm our business 
litigation might be necessary to protect our patent position or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights  and we may not have the required resources to pursue such litigation or to protect our patent rights 
although we require our scientific and technical employees and consultants to enter into broad assignment of inventions agreements  and all of our employees  consultants and corporate partners with access to proprietary information to enter into confidentiality agreements  these agreements may not be honored 
we are a counterclaim defendant in a lawsuit instituted by dr 
platt 
see risks related to pro pharmaceuticals above 
products we develop could be subject to infringement claims asserted by others 
we cannot assure that products based on our patents or intellectual property that we license from others will not be challenged by a third party claiming infringement of its proprietary rights 
if we were not able to successfully defend our patents or licensed rights  we may have to pay substantial damages  possibly including treble damages  for past infringement 
we face intense competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive 
we face direct competition from us and foreign companies focusing on drug delivery technologies  which are rapidly evolving 
our competitors include major  multinational pharmaceutical and chemical companies  specialized biotechnology firms and universities and other research institutions 
many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources  larger research and development staffs and more effective marketing and manufacturing organizations  than we do 
in addition  academic and government institutions are increasingly likely to enter into exclusive licensing agreements with commercial enterprises  including our competitors  to market commercial products based on technology developed at such institutions 
our competitors may succeed in developing or licensing technologies and products that are more effective or less costly than ours  or succeed in obtaining fda or other regulatory approvals for product candidates before we do 
health care cost containment initiatives and the growth of managed care may limit our returns 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will be affected by the ongoing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain the cost of health care 
these entities are challenging prices of health care products and services  denying or limiting coverage and reimbursement amounts for new therapeutic products  and for fda approved products considered experimental or investigational  or which are used for disease indications without fda marketing approval 

table of contents even if we succeed in bringing any products to the market  they may not be considered cost effective and third party reimbursement might not be available or sufficient 
if adequate third party coverage is not available  we may not be able to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development 
in addition  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change in ways adverse to us before or after any of our proposed products are approved for marketing 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate in all circumstances 
in the future  we may  in the ordinary course of business  be subject to claims by  and liability to  persons alleging injury as a result of taking products we have under development 
if we are successful in having products approved by the fda  the sale of such products would expose us to additional potential product liability and other claims resulting from their use 
this liability may result from claims made directly by consumers or by pharmaceutical companies or others selling such products 
although we currently have insurance coverage for both product liability and professional liability  it is possible that we will not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms 
any inability to maintain insurance coverage on acceptable terms could prevent or limit the commercialization of any products we develop 
risks related to our stock stock prices for biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are volatile 
the market price for securities of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies historically has been highly volatile  and the market from time to time has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
fluctuations in the trading price or liquidity of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through future equity financings 
large sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock 
we listed our common stock on the american stock exchange in september  prior to which our stock traded on the otc bulletin board 
accordingly  there is a limited history of trading of our stock on a national exchange and  based on varying trading volume to date  our stock could be considered thinly traded 
in the last six months of we undertook the registration  on behalf of certain of our stockholders  of a total of  shares of our common stock and  shares of stock issuable upon exercise of immediately exercisable warrants 
in  we registered an additional  shares of common stock and  shares of stock issuable upon exercise of warrants on behalf of certain of our stockholders 
in general  shares of registered common stock may be re sold into the public markets without volume or other restrictions 
large sales of our registered shares could place substantial downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock  particularly if the amount sold significantly exceeds the then current trading volume of our stock 
downward pressure on our stock price could result if certain stockholders become short term investors 
we sold shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in so called pipe private investment in public equity transactions in october  april and august to investors who  as an incentive to purchase our securities in private placements  required us promptly to register their shares including shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants for resale into the public markets 
we may enter into similar financing transactions in the future with the same or different investors 
because such investors typically receive registered shares well in advance of the expiration of the holding periods under rule of the securities act  they may choose to sell their shares after a short period of holding our stock 
if sufficient quantities of stock are sold during a brief interval of time  this could result in downward pressure on the market price for shares of our publicly traded common stock 
four principal stockholders own enough shares to control the company 
four of our principal stockholders  david platt  james czirr  offer binder and anatole klyosov own or control approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock  and dr 
platt and mr 
czirr together own approximately 
some or all of these stockholders  acting in concert  may be able to substantially influence the election of the board of directors and other corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  such as recapitalization or other 
table of contents fundamental corporate action  as well as the direction and policies of our company 
such concentration of ownership also could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of the company that might otherwise be beneficial to stockholders 
changes in laws  regulations and financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations 
the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations may result in changes in accounting standards or accepted practices within our industry and could add significant new costs to being a public company 
new laws  regulations and accounting standards  as well as changes to currently accepted accounting practices  including the expensing of stock options  could adversely affect our reported financial results and negatively affect our stock price 
additional unanticipated expenses incurred to comply with new requirements could also negatively impact our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to changes in the us interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve cash until it is required to fund operations 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents in operating bank accounts and money market funds 
since our investments are short term in duration  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any interest bearing debt  foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
