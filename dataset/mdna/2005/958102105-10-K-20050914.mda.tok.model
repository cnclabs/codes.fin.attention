the company western digital corporation designs  develops  manufactures and sells hard disk drives 
a hard disk drive is a device that stores data on one or more rotating magnetic disks to allow fast access to data 
hard disk drives are one of the key components found in most computers and data storage subsystems 
the company s hard disk drives are used in desktop personal computers pcs  notebook computers  enterprise applications such as servers  workstations  network attached storage and storage area networks  and in consumer electronics ce products such as personal digital video recorders dvrs and satellite and cable set top boxes stbs 
in addition  the company s hard disk drives are used in external hard disk drive products that feature high speed buses such as firewire ilink tm  universal serial bus usb and ethernet 
hard disk drives provide non volatile data storage  which means that the data is not lost when power is no longer applied to the device 
the company s hard disk drive products currently include inch and inch form factor drives 
the inch form factor drives have capacities ranging from gigabytes gb to gb  nominal rotation speeds of  and  revolutions per minute rpm  and offer interfaces including enhanced integrated drive electronics eide and serial advanced technology attachment sata 
the inch form factor drives have capacities ranging from gb to gb  nominal rotation speed of rpms  and offer the eide interface 
in addition  the company has plans to enter the inch hard disk drive market in the future 
the company anticipates that inch hard disk drive products could be used in a variety of handheld consumer devices such as mp players  cameras  and cell phones 
the company sells its products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers oems for inclusion in computer systems or subsystems  and to distributors  resellers and retailers 
the company s hard disk drive products are currently manufactured in malaysia and thailand 
for geographical financial data  see the company s consolidated financial statements and note thereto included in this annual report on form k 
market overview for calendar year  the company believes that the total market for hard disk drives was more than million units  or almost billion 
over half of these unit shipments were to the desktop pc market 
thus  total hard disk drive unit growth depends greatly on developments in the pc market 
wd believes that the demand for hard disk drives in the pc market will continue to grow in part due to the overall growth of pc sales in established markets  the growth in emerging economies  such as india and china  driving the increased deployment of personal computers  the increasing needs of businesses and individuals to store larger amounts of data on their pcs  the increasing sales of mobile computers that may have shorter replacement cycles and or additional sales for individuals to have both a desktop and a mobile computer  the continuing development of software applications to manage multimedia content  and the increasing use of broadband internet  including downloading content from the internet onto pc hard disk drives 
the company believes the rate of hard disk drive unit growth in the desktop pc market is affected by several factors  including maturing pc markets in north america and western europe  an increase in first time buyers of pcs in eastern europe and asia  the lengthening of pc replacement cycles and an increasing preference for notebook systems 
the company expects that the mobile computing market  which is primarily notebook computers  to grow faster than the desktop pc market due to customer preference in the next three years 
western digital entered the mobile hard disk drive market in october  commencing volume production of its wd scorpio tm family of inch hard disk drives for notebooks 
as the market for consumer applications expands  additional investments by the company will be required 
for example  ce products such as handheld digital audio players currently utilize sub inch form factor hard disk drives 
in january  western digital announced it has plans to enter the miniature hard disk drive market with a inch gigabyte product 
in addition  while ce products may require hard disk drives that are similar in nature to desktop hard disk drives  these products have often required specialized features or functions driving additional development versus desktop products 
the enterprise market for hard disk drives focuses on customers that make workstations  servers  network attached storage devices  storage area networks  and other computing systems or subsystems 
western digital serves this market through its application of the sata interface 
the sata interface contains many of the same benefits of the small computer systems interface  or scsi the predominant interface currently used in most enterprise hard disk drive applications 
the company believes that the use of the sata interfaces in enterprise hard disk drives is growing

revenue and accounts receivable in accordance with standard industry practice  western digital has agreements with resellers that provide limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and other incentive programs 
in accordance with current accounting standards  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment or delivery to resellers and records a reduction to revenue for estimated price protection and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers 
adjustments are based on anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period  estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers  as well as historical pricing information 
if end market demand for hard disk drives declines significantly  the company may have to increase sell through incentive payments to resellers  resulting in an increase in price protection allowances  which could adversely impact operating results

the company bases these provisions on existing product return notifications as well as historical returns by product type see warranty 
if actual sales returns exceed expectations  an increase in the sales return provision would be required  which could negatively affect operating results

warranty covers costs of repair or replacement of the hard disk drive over the warranty period  which generally ranges from one to five years 
the company has comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for warranty  which include specific detail on hard disk drives in the field by product type  historical field return rates and costs to repair 
if actual product return rates or costs to repair returned products differ significantly from current expectations  a change in the warranty provision would be required 
for a summary of historical changes in estimates related to pre existing warranty provisions  refer to part ii
