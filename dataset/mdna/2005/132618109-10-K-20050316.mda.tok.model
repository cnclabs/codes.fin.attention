item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general since its incorporation in  camco has evolved into a full service provider of financial products to the communities served by advantage 
utilizing a common marketing theme based on camco s commitment to personalized customer service  camco and its affiliates have grown from million of consolidated assets in to billion of consolidated assets at december  camco s rate of growth is largely attributable to its acquisitions of marietta savings  first savings  first bank for savings  germantown federal  westwood homestead  columbia savings and the citizens bank of london  and its continued expansion of product lines from the limited deposit and loan offerings which the bank could offer in the heavily regulated environment of the s to the wider array of financial service products that commercial banks traditionally offer 
additionally  camco has enhanced its operational growth  to a lesser extent  by chartering a title insurance agency 
management believes that continued success in the financial services industry will be achieved by those institutions with a rigorous dedication to building value added customer oriented organizations 
toward this end  each of the bank s divisions have the ability to make local decisions for customer contacts and services  however back office operations are consolidated and centralized 
based on consumer preferences  the bank s management designs financial service products with a view towards differentiating each of the constituent divisions from its competition 
management believes that the bank divisions ability to rapidly adapt to consumer needs and preferences is essential to them as community based financial institutions competing against the larger regional and money center bank holding companies 
camco s profitability depends primarily on its level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  principally loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and interest expense on deposit accounts and borrowings 
in recent years  camco s operations have also been heavily influenced by its level of other income  including mortgage banking income and other fee income 
camco s operations are also affected by general  administrative and other expenses  including employee compensation and benefits  occupancy expense  data processing  franchise taxes  advertising  other operating expenses and federal income tax expense 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
when used herein  the terms anticipates  plans  expects  believes  and similar expressions as they relate to camco or its management are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
camco s actual results  performance or achievements may materially differ from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
risks and uncertainties that could cause or contribute to such material differences include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  interest rate environment  competitive conditions in the financial services industry  changes in law  governmental policies and regulations  and rapidly changing technology affecting financial services 
non gaap financial measures this report includes one or more non gaap financial measures within the meaning of regulation g 
with respect to each  camco has disclosed the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and reconciled the differences between the non gaap financial measure and the most comparable financial measure presented in accordance with gaap 
camco believes that the presentation of the non gaap financial measures in this report assist management and investors to compare results period to period in a more meaningful and consistent manner and provide a better measure of results for camco s ongoing operations 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures found elsewhere in this annual report  are based upon camco s consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires camco to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under us gaap 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and goodwill impairment 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses the procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses reflect our evaluation of credit risk after careful consideration of all information available to us 
in developing this assessment  we must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  developments affecting companies in specific industries and issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results  which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is regularly reviewed by management to determine whether the amount is considered adequate to absorb probable losses 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans  statistical loss estimates for loan pools that are based on historical loss experience  and general loss estimates that are based upon the size  quality  and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  and current economic and industry conditions 
also considered as part of that judgment is a review of the bank s trends in delinquencies and loan losses  as well as trends in delinquencies and losses for the region and nationally  and economic factors 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
while management strives to reflect all known risk factors in its evaluations  judgment errors may occur 
during its audit  camco s accountants identified a lack of comprehensive procedural documentation concerning the asset classification of specific loans in accordance with fas no 
management has addressed this issue as discussed in the management report on internal control over financial reporting 
mortgage servicing rights to determine the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights msrs each reporting quarter  advantage transmits information to a third party provider  representing individual loan information in each pooling period accompanied by escrow amounts 
the third party then evaluates the possible impairment of msrs as described below 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when loans are sold with servicing retained 
a pooling methodology to the servicing valuation  in which loans with similar characteristics are pooled together  is applied for valuation purposes 
once pooled  each grouping of loans is evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings that a purchaser could expect to realize from the portfolio 
earnings are projected from a variety of sources including loan service fees  interest earned on float  net interest earned on escrow balances  miscellaneous income and costs to service the loans 
the present value of future earnings is the estimated market value for the pool  calculated using consensus assumptions that a third party purchaser would utilize in evaluating a potential acquisition of the servicing 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates and the related impact on mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the interest rate for float  which is supplied by management  takes into consideration the investment portfolio average yield as well as current short duration investment yields 
management believes this methodology provides a reasonable estimate 
mortgage loan prepayment speeds are calculated by the third party provider utilizing the economic outlook as published by the office of chief economist of freddie mac in estimating prepayment speeds and provides a specific scenario with each evaluation 
based on the assumptions discussed  pre tax projections are prepared for each pool of loans serviced 
these earning figures approximate the cash flow that could be received from the servicing portfolio 
valuation results are presented quarterly to management 
at that time  management reviews the information and mortgage servicing rights are marked to lower of amortized cost or market for the current quarter 
goodwill we have developed procedures to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis using june financial information 
this testing procedure is outsourced to a third party that evaluates possible impairment based on the following the test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities  identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 
the value is determined assuming a freely negotiated transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller  neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts 
accordingly  to derive the fair value of the reporting unit  the following common approaches to valuing business combination transactions involving financial institutions are utilized by a third party selected by camco the comparable transactions approach specifically based on earnings  book  assets and deposit premium multiples received in recent sales of comparable thrift franchises  and the discounted cash flow approach 
the application of these valuation techniques takes into account the reporting unit s operating history  the current market environment and future prospects 
as of the most recent quarter  the only reporting unit carrying goodwill is the bank 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and no second step is required 
if not  a second test is required to measure the amount of goodwill impairment 
the second test of the overall goodwill impairment compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
the impairment loss shall equal the excess of carrying value over fair value 
after each testing period  the third party compiles a summary of the test that is then provided to the audit committee for review 
as of the most recent testing date  june   the audit committee was informed that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
summary management believes the accounting estimates related to the allowance for loan losses  the capitalization  amortization  and valuation of mortgage servicing rights and the goodwill impairment test are critical accounting estimates because the estimates are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require management to make assumptions concerning the changes in the types and volumes of the portfolios  rates of future prepayments  and anticipated economic conditions  and the impact of recognizing an impairment or loan loss could have a material effect on camco s assets reported on the balance sheet as well as its net earnings 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed camco s disclosures relating to such matters in the quarterly management s discussion and analysis 
discussion of financial condition changes from december  to december  at december   camco s consolidated assets totaled billion  an increase of million  or  from the december  total 
the increase in total assets was primarily due to the acquisition of london in august  which was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the acquisition resulted in net asset growth of approximately million which was funded principally by an increase of million in advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb 
in december of  advantage sold its ashland division  consisting of two branches  which resulted in a premium of on deposits 
while all deposits were sold in the ashland division sale  camco retained loan origination capabilities in the huntington  west virginia market 
the sale included million in loans and million of deposits 
the ashland branch sale was funded by a sale of approximately million in loans 
cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  levels 
investment securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the total at december  investment securities purchases were comprised of million of intermediate and short term issuances of treasury and agency securities  with an average yield of 
some of the securities purchased contained call features 
such purchases were offset by maturities of million and sales of million during the year 
mortgage backed securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  mortgage backed securities purchases totaled million  while principal repayments totaled million and sales totaled million during the year ended december  purchases of mortgage backed securities during the year were comprised primarily of government agency mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations yielding 
loans receivable and loans held for sale totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  over the total at december  the increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of london  accounting for an increase of million in loans and loan disbursements and purchases totaling million  which were substantially offset by loan sales of million  including million of sales relating to the sale of the ashland division and principal repayments of million 
loan origination volume  including purchases of loans  was lower in than by million  or  which was primarily attributable to the decline in refinancing activity 
as interest rates in the economy have begun to rise  consumer preference is moving towards adjustable rate mortgage loans to fund purchases 
camco has typically held adjustable rate mortgage loans in its portfolio as part of its strategy to maintain its asset sensitive interest rate risk position 
loan originations during the twelve month period ended december   were comprised primarily of million of loans secured by one to four family residential real estate  million in consumer and other loans and million in loans secured by commercial real estate 
management will continue to expand its consumer and commercial real estate lending in future periods as a means of increasing the yield on its loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  representing and of nonperforming loans at those dates 
nonperforming loans days or more delinquent plus nonaccrual loans totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively  constituting and of total net loans  including loans held for sale  at those dates 
at december   nonperforming loans were comprised of million of loans secured by one to four family residential real estate  million of loans secured by multi family  nonresidential real estate and commercial loans and million of consumer and other loans 
although management believes that its allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate based upon the available facts and circumstances  there can be no assurance that additions to such allowance will not be necessary in future periods  which could adversely affect camco s results of operations 
deposits totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  levels 
the decrease resulted primarily from the sale of ashland division deposits totaling million partially offset by million increase from the london acquisition 
the million deposit portfolio growth resulted primarily from the increase of deposits from state and local government agencies and management s continuing efforts to achieve a moderate rate of growth through advertising and pricing strategies 
advances from the fhlb increased by million  or  to a total of million at december  the increase was due primarily to equity leveraging transactions of million and million in fees incurred for the restructuring of the fhlb borrowings 
in the fourth quarter of  advantage restructured million of its fhlb borrowings having an average term of years and an average fixed rate of  replacing them with fixed rate advances having a weighted average rate of approximately at december  the prepayment fee incurred was million on an after tax basis  but management believes that the positive after tax earnings impact in could approach million or 
per share in the transaction positions itself well in our balance sheet as a result of continued efforts towards shorter duration assets generated from commercial commercial real estate and consumer loans 
stockholders equity totaled million at december   a million  or  decrease from december  the decrease resulted primarily from dividends of million  a net loss of million and a  decrease in the unrealized gains on available for sale securities  which were partially offset by the issuance of million in common stock to shareholders of london and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of camco and the bank are required to maintain minimum regulatory capital pursuant to federal regulations 
during  management was notified by its primary regulators that advantage was categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
at december   the regulatory capital of camco and the bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  general 
camco s net loss for the year ended december   totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from the million of net earnings reported in the decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to a one time charge of million in pre tax expense associated with the restructuring of a portion of the bank s fhlb borrowings and a million decrease in gain on sale of loans  which were partially offset by a million gain due to the sale of the ashland division and a million decrease in the provision for federal income taxes 
in december camco announced the restructuring of million in convertible fixed rate borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
the early prepayment of the debt resulted in a penalty charge of million before tax  or million after tax 
the convertible advances had a weighted average interest rate of and an average term to maturity of approximately years 
the advances were replaced with maturities ranging up to five years 
the weighted average cost on the restructured borrowings was 
the impact of the restructuring is estimated to reduce interest expense for the corporation by over million pre tax in  or million after tax basis 
this anticipated decrease in interest bearing liabilities should increase earnings per share for the corporation by approximately 
in in december  camco sold its ashland division which included million in deposits and million in loans in the ashland market as well as the ashland and summit  kentucky facilities 
this transaction was based on a decision to redirect resources and management attention to other markets that drive the execution of our long term strategic plan 
our branch strategy involves narrowing our geographic footprint  building a more efficient branch network and improving long term shareholder value 
net interest income 
total interest income for the year ended december   amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  compared to  generally reflecting the effects of a decrease of basis points in the average yield  from in to in  offset partially by a million  or  increase in the average balance of interest earning assets outstanding year to year 
interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the comparable total 
the decrease resulted primarily from a basis point decrease in the average yield  from in  to in  offset partially by a million  or  increase in the average balance of loans outstanding year to year 
interest income on mortgage backed securities totaled million for the year ended december   a  or  decrease from the period 
the decrease was due primarily to a million  or  decrease in the average balance outstanding  partially offset by a basis point increase in the average yield  to in interest income on investment securities decreased by  or  due primarily to a million decrease in the average balance outstanding year to year  coupled with a basis point decline in the average yield  to in interest income on other interest earning assets increased by  or  due primarily to an increase in the yield of basis points  to in  offset partially by a decrease of million  or  in the average balance outstanding year to year 
interest expense on deposits totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to a basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits  to for  partially offset by a million  or  increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits outstanding year to year 
interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  from the decrease resulted primarily from a basis point decrease in the average rate to in  partially offset by a million  or  increase in the average balance outstanding year to year 
as a result of the foregoing changes in interest income and interest expense  net interest income increased by million  or  to a total of million for the year ended december  the interest rate spread increased to approximately at december   from at december   while the net interest margin increased to approximately for the year ended december   compared to for the period 
provision for losses on loans 
a provision for losses on loans is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by the bank  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to the bank s market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of the bank s loan portfolio 
based upon an analysis of these factors  management recorded a provision for losses on loans totaling million for the year ended december   an increase of  or  over the provision recorded in the provision was predicated primarily on the overall increase in the loan portfolio  including the increased percentage of loans secured by nonresidential real estate within the portfolio and an increase in the level of impaired loans and loan charge offs year to year 
for  we believe the provision will continue to grow as we anticipate changing our loan mix by increasing the percentage of nonresidential commercial loans and consumer loans to total loans 
management believes nonperforming loans are adequately collateralized or reserved for  however  there can be no assurance that the loan loss allowance will be adequate to absorb losses on known nonperforming assets or that the allowance will be adequate to cover losses on nonperforming loans in the future 
other income 
other income totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the increase in other income was primarily attributable to the sale of our ashland  kentucky banking division which resulted in a pretax gain of million 
excluding the sale of the ashland banking division  other income would have decreased from million in to million in this decrease of million was primarily attributable to a million or decrease in gain on the sale of loans  as a result of fewer loans being sold into the secondary market  as well as a reduction of  or in our title agency revenue  also due to lower residential loan production levels 
the decrease in gain on sale of loans was due primarily to a decrease in the volume of loans sold of million  or  from the volume of loans sold in during  the bank recorded msr s on new loan sales totaling million and amortization of msr s totaling million  which resulted in net revenue item of  during  the bank recorded msr s on new loan sales totaling million and amortization of msr s totaling million  which resulted in net revenue of  general  administrative and other expense 
general  administrative and other expense totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the increase was due primarily to the million prepayment fee associated with the restructuring of a portion of the bank s fhlb borrowings and a decrease of million  or  in deferred compensation sfas no 
 offset partially by a decrease of  in employee compensation and benefits and a  or decrease in occupancy and equipment expenses 
the decrease in deferred compensation relates to sfas no 
and the decline in residential loan production 
the decrease in employee compensation and benefits is due to lower incentives and commissions on reduced loan production from prior periods 
the decrease in occupancy and equipment was due to management s more efficient utilization of the current infrastructure and continuing capitalization on past investments in technology 
federal income taxes 
federal income tax credits totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the provision recorded in this decrease was primarily attributable to a million net loss before federal income tax credits

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of the bank s asset liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within the bank s policy limits 
this objective is accomplished through management of the bank s balance sheet composition  liquidity  and interest rate risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions  interest rates and customer preferences 
the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan demand or unexpected deposit withdrawals 
this is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of investment securities  maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity and achieving consistent growth in core deposits 
management considers interest rate risk the bank s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
consistency of the bank s net interest income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk 
to identify and manage its interest rate risk  the bank employs an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
the model also includes senior management projections for activity levels in each of the product lines offered by the bank 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
assumptions are inherently uncertain and the measurement of net interest income or the impact of rate fluctuations on net interest income cannot be precisely predicted 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the bank s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives and reports to the bank s board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
the bank s current interest rate risk position is determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a month horizon assuming a basis point bp instantaneous and parallel shift linear increase or decrease in all interest rates 
given the federal funds rate of at december   a linear bp decrease was modeled in the estimated earnings sensitivity profile in place of the linear bp decrease in accordance with the bank s interest rate risk policy 
current policy limits this exposure to plus or minus of net interest income for a month horizon 
the following table shows the bank s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  change in percentage change in interest rates net interest income basis points months given a bp linear increase in the yield curve used in the simulation model  it is estimated net interest income for the bank would increase by over one year 
a bp linear decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by over one year 
all of these estimated changes in net interest income are within the policy guidelines established by the board of directors 
management does not expect any significant adverse effect on net interest income in based on the composition of the portfolio and anticipated upward trends in rates 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity  the bank has developed sale procedures for several types of interest sensitive assets 
generally  all long term  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or federal national mortgage association fnma guidelines are sold for cash upon origination 
a total of million and million of such loans were sold to the fhlmc  fnma and other parties during and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources camco  like other financial institutions  is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain sufficient funds to meet deposit withdrawals  loan commitments and expenses
