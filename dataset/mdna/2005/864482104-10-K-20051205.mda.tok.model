the following are factors that regularly affect our operating results and financial condition product costs the level of profitability in the retail propane  fuel oil  natural gas and electricity businesses is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and product cost 
the unit cost of our products  particularly propane and fuel oil  is subject to volatile changes as a result of product supply or other market conditions  including  but not limited to  economic and political factors impacting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing 
product cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
there is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product cost increases fully or immediately  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
therefore  average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year to year as product costs fluctuate with propane  fuel oil  crude oil and natural gas commodity market conditions 
in addition  in periods of sustained higher commodity prices  as was experienced in fiscal  retail sales volumes may be negatively impacted by customer conservation efforts 
seasonality the retail propane and fuel oil distribution businesses  as well as the natural gas marketing business  are seasonal because of the primary use for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of our retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season from october through march 
the fuel oil business tends to experience greater seasonality given its more limited use for space heating and approximately three fourths of our fuel oil volumes are sold between october and march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in our first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for product purchased during the winter heating season 
we expect lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
to the extent necessary  we will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to holders of our partnership interests in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
weather weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products  in particular propane  fuel oil and natural gas  for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many of our customers rely heavily on propane  fuel oil or natural gas as a heating source 
accordingly  the volume sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas  which can vary substantially from year to year 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane  fuel oil and natural gas consumption  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater use 
risk management product supply contracts are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal and generally permit suppliers to charge posted market prices plus transportation costs at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery points 
since rapid increases in the cost of propane or fuel oil may not be immediately passed on to retail customers  such increases could reduce profitability 
during fiscal  approximately of our fuel oil volumes were sold to individual customers under agreements pre establishing a maximum price per gallon over a twelve month period the ceiling program 
while our strategy was to enter into derivative instruments in the form of futures and options traded on the nymex covering a majority of the fuel oil we expected to sell to customers under the ceiling program in an effort to protect the margins under the program  we evaluated the costs of such hedge protection and elected not to hedge february through april deliveries under this program 
after evaluating the costs to adequately hedge the ceiling program in the current commodity price environment  we decided to discontinue offering the ceiling program after the fiscal heating season 
we engage in risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs and to help ensure the availability of product during periods of short supply 
we are currently a party to propane and fuel oil futures contracts traded on the nymex and enter into forward and option agreements with third parties to purchase and sell propane at fixed prices in the future 
risk management activities are monitored by an internal commodity risk management committee  made up of five members of management  through enforcement of our hedging and risk management policy and reported to our audit committee 
risk management transactions may not always result in increased product margins 
see item a of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results 
estimates are used when accounting for depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  employee benefit plans  self insurance and legal reserves  environmental reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  asset valuation assessments and valuation of derivative instruments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known to us 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note  summary of significant accounting policies  included within the notes to consolidated financial statements section elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe that the following are our critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of propane  fuel oil and other refined fuels at the time product is delivered to the customer 
revenue from the sale of appliances and equipment is recognized at the time of sale or when installation is complete  as applicable 
revenue from repairs  maintenance and other service activities is recognized upon completion of the service 
revenue from hvac service contracts is recognized ratably over the service period 
revenue from our natural gas and electricity business is recognized based on customer usage as determined by meter readings  plus an amount for natural gas and electricity delivered but unbilled at the end of each accounting period 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate our allowances for doubtful accounts using a specific reserve for known or anticipated uncollectible accounts  as well as an estimated reserve for potential future uncollectible accounts taking into consideration our historical write offs 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we estimate the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate to estimate the present value of future benefit obligations and the cost of future health care benefits in determining our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in market conditions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
see pension plan assets and obligations below for additional disclosure regarding pension benefits 
self insurance reserves 
our accrued insurance reserves represent the estimated costs of known and anticipated or unasserted claims under our general and product  workers compensation and automobile insurance policies 
accrued insurance provisions for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents are based on an analysis of historical claims data 
for each claim  we record a self insurance provision up to the estimated amount of the probable claim utilizing actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data 
we maintain insurance coverage wherein our net exposure for insured claims is limited to the insurance deductible  claims above which are paid by our insurance carriers 
for the portion of our estimated self insurance liability that exceeds our deductibles  we record an asset related to the amount of the liability expected to be covered by insurance 
environmental reserves 
we establish reserves for environmental exposures when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based upon our best estimate of costs associated with environmental remediation and ongoing monitoring activities 
accrued environmental reserves are exclusive of claims against third parties  and an asset is established where contribution or reimbursement from such third parties has been agreed and we are reasonably assured of receiving such contribution or reimbursement 
environmental reserves are not discounted 
goodwill impairment assessment 
we assess the carrying value of goodwill at a reporting unit level  at least annually  based on an estimate of the fair value of the respective reporting unit 
fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses taking into consideration estimated cash flows in a ten year projection period and a terminal value calculation at the end of the projection period 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see item a of this annual report for information about accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
executive summary of results of operations and financial condition fiscal presented a very challenging operating environment resulting from the combination of an erratic weather pattern and highly volatile commodity prices 
while nationwide average temperatures  as reported by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa  were warmer than normal in both fiscal and fiscal  significantly warmer than normal temperatures during the critical months of the fiscal heating season november through february had a significant negative impact on both propane and fuel oil volumes 
average temperatures during these critical months were warmer than normal 
in addition to the impact that warmer weather typically has on volumes  the combination of warm weather and high energy prices has led to increased customer conservation efforts 
in the commodities markets  the average posted prices of propane and fuel oil began a precipitous rise in september  which continued to unprecedented levels during the heating season and continued with a counter seasonal trend through the end of fiscal  particularly in the fuel oil markets 
average posted prices of propane and fuel oil during fiscal increased and  respectively  compared to average posted prices in fiscal while propane margins remained strong  margin opportunities and therefore profitability in our refined fuels segment were severely restricted during the fiscal heating season as a result of our inability to pass on fully the rise in fuel oil prices due to our ceiling program  coupled with our decision not to hedge february through april deliveries under the ceiling program 
due to the extreme market volatility for fuel oil  the costs to hedge  in relation to the expected margins under this program  became prohibitive 
the lost margin opportunity from this fuel oil ceiling program had the most significant negative impact on our financial results for fiscal accounting for an estimated impact of million on the year over year comparison of operating margins in the fuel oil and refined fuels segment 
after evaluating the costs to adequately hedge this program in the current price environment  management decided to discontinue offering the fuel oil ceiling program after the fiscal heating season 
in light of warmer weather and customer conservation efforts  retail propane gallons sold in fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in fiscal sales of fuel oil and other refined fuels increased million gallons  or  to million gallons  compared to million gallons in the prior fiscal year 
the negative impact of warm weather and high energy prices on volumes was partially offset by a full twelve months of agway energy operations in fiscal compared to nine months in fiscal for fiscal  we reported a net loss of million  or per common unit  a decrease of million  compared to net income of million  or per common unit  in fiscal we reported earnings before interest  loss on debt extinguishment  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in fiscal in addition to the negative impact on our financial results from the fuel oil ceiling program  ebitda and net loss for fiscal were unfavorably impacted by million and million  respectively  as a result of certain significant items relating mainly to i a million loss on debt extinguishment recorded in the third quarter associated with our debt refinancing  ii a million restructuring charge attributable primarily to severance associated with the realignment of our field operations  iii a million charge attributable to impairment of goodwill associated with our hvac segment  iv a million charge included within amortization expense attributable to the impairment of other intangible assets in our hvac segment  and v million included within depreciation expense attributable to impairment of assets affected by the field realignment 
by comparison  ebitda and net income for fiscal included the net favorable impact of million and million  respectively  from certain significant items mainly related to i a million gain from the sale of customer service centers in the northern and southern central regions of the united states considered to be non strategic  ii a non cash charge of million included within cost of products sold related to the settlement of futures contracts which were marked to market under purchase accounting for the agway acquisition  iii a non cash pension settlement charge of million related to accelerated recognition of actuarial losses in our defined benefit pension plan  iv a non cash charge of million attributable to impairment of goodwill related to a small business acquired in  v a million restructuring charge related to integrating certain field management and back office functions in the northeast  and vi a non cash charge of million included within depreciation expense attributable to the write down of assets to be disposed of as a result of our efforts to integrate certain northeast operations 
while the continued high price environment had a negative impact on our volumes as a result of customer conservation efforts and on the profitability of our refined fuels segment  our propane segment generated solid results despite the challenging environment 
profitability of our propane segment increased million  or  in fiscal compared to the prior year 
additionally  during the second half of fiscal  we took positive steps to add financial flexibility and drive further efficiencies throughout our operations  highlighted by the successful completion of our debt refinancing and  more recently  the reorganization of our field operations to streamline our operating footprint and leverage our system infrastructure 
in connection with our field realignment  we eliminated approximately positions and have begun to consolidate customer service centers for further cost savings 
as we look ahead to fiscal  with the continued integration of the agway energy operations  the operating efficiencies expected from our internal reorganization and the steps already taken to eliminate the fuel oil ceiling program  we believe we are well positioned for significant earnings growth in fiscal our anticipated cash requirements for fiscal include i maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately million  ii approximately million of interest payments  and  iii assuming distributions remain at the current level  approximately million of distributions to common unitholders and the general partner 
the projected level of capital expenditures for fiscal is approximately million higher than our expected annual level of capital spending in subsequent years  primarily as a result of anticipated spending on system enhancements and facility integration 
additionally  as our field realignment efforts continue into fiscal we may incur additional restructuring or asset impairment charges 
based on our current estimate of our cash position  availability under the revolving credit agreement unused borrowing capacity under the working capital facility of million at november  and expected cash flow from operating activities  we expect to have sufficient funds to meet our current and future obligations

total revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended september  compared to  million for the year ended september  driven primarily by a significant increase in average selling prices in line with higher product costs  the inclusion of the agway energy operations for a full twelve months in fiscal compared to nine months in the prior year  offset to an extent by the impact on volumes from warmer weather 
retail sales volumes in our propane and fuel oil segments were negatively impacted by a combination of warmer than normal average nationwide temperatures  as well as the impact of customer conservation efforts from the significant rise in energy costs 
as reported by noaa  average nationwide temperatures in both fiscal and were warmer than normal 
however  the fiscal heating season presented a very erratic weather pattern with significantly warmer than normal temperatures during the critical months of the heating season november through february offset somewhat by a burst of cold weather in march average nationwide temperatures were warmer than normal during these critical months in fiscal revenues in our propane segment of million for the year ended september  increased million  or  compared to million in the prior year 
this increase is the result of higher average selling prices in line with higher commodity prices  offset to an extent by lower retail sales volumes attributable to the combination of warmer weather and customer conservation 
retail propane gallons sold decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons in fiscal from million gallons in the prior year 
average retail selling prices increased approximately as a result of sustained higher commodity prices for propane 
the average posted price of propane during fiscal increased approximately compared to the average posted prices in the prior year 
additionally  included within the propane segment are revenues from wholesale and risk management activities of million for the year ended september  which decreased million  or  compared to the prior year 
revenues from the distribution of fuel oil and other refined fuels of million for the year ended september  increased million  or  from million in the prior year from a combination of increased volumes and significantly higher selling prices 
sales of fuel oil and other refined fuels amounted to million gallons during fiscal compared to million gallons in the prior year  an increase of million gallons  or  primarily reflecting the impact of the agway energy operations for a full twelve months in fiscal compared to nine months in the prior year  offset to an extent by the impact of warm weather and customer conservation 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we exited certain lower margin low sulfur diesel and gasoline businesses  thus negatively impacting the volume comparison year over year 
average fuel oil posted prices increased even more dramatically than propane prices throughout fiscal reaching unprecedented levels into the third and fourth quarters 
for the year  average posted price of fuel oil increased compared to the average posted prices in fiscal average fuel oil selling prices increased approximately as we were unable to pass on fully the significant rise in the commodity prices as a result of the fuel oil ceiling program see below for the impact on cost of products sold 
revenues in our natural gas and electricity segment for the year ended september  increased million  or  to million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to higher average selling prices for both natural gas and electricity in line with higher product costs  as well as the impact of a full twelve months of operations in fiscal revenues in our hvac segment increased  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in hvac revenues reflects the impact of a full twelve months from the agway energy operations  offset to an extent by lower service and installation activities during the last nine months of fiscal compared to the prior year

the cost of products sold reported in the consolidated statements of operations represents the weighted average unit cost of propane and fuel oil sold  as well as the cost of natural gas and electricity  including transportation costs to deliver product from our supply points to storage or to our customer service centers 
cost of products sold also includes the cost of appliances and related parts sold or installed by our customer service centers computed on a basis that approximates the average cost of the products 
cost of products sold is reported exclusive of any depreciation and amortization  these amounts are reported separately within the consolidated statements of operations 
cost of products sold increased million  or  to  million for the year ended september  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase results primarily from higher commodity prices for propane and fuel oil  coupled with the full year impact of the agway energy operations 
cost of products sold associated with the distribution of propane and related activities of million increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
higher propane prices resulted in a million increase in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year  partially offset by the decline in propane volumes which had an impact of million 
lower wholesale and risk management activities  noted above  decreased cost of products sold by million compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold associated with our fuel oil and refined fuels segment of million for the year ended september  increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
the impact of the unprecedented high commodity prices increased cost of products sold by million during fiscal compared to the prior year and the increased volumes had an impact of million 
cost of products sold in the prior year also included a million non cash charge associated with the settlement of futures contracts that were acquired in the agway acquisition 
as the underlying futures and option contracts were settled  the derivative assets were charged to cost of products sold as an offset to the realized gains from contract settlement 
the impact on cost of products sold represented a non cash charge resulting from the application of purchase accounting on derivative instruments acquired 
while revenues increased  margin opportunities and therefore profitability in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment were significantly restricted during our second and third quarters of fiscal as a result of our fuel oil ceiling program 
we were unable in the prevailing high price environment to pass on fully the rise in fuel oil prices due to the restrictions of our fuel oil ceiling program  which pre established a maximum price per gallon  coupled with our decision not to hedge this pricing program for the february through april deliveries when confronted with unprecedented costs to properly hedge the program during that period 
the lost margin opportunity from this fuel oil ceiling program had the most significant negative impact on our financial results for fiscal accounting for an estimated impact of million on the year over year comparison of operating margins in the fuel oil and refined fuels segment 
after evaluating the costs to adequately hedge this program in the current price environment  management decided to discontinue offering the fuel oil ceiling program after the fiscal heating season 
cost of products sold as a percentage of revenues in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment increased from during fiscal to in fiscal primarily as a result of our inability to pass on fully the unprecedented rise in fuel oil prices  coupled with the fact that february through april deliveries under the ceiling program were not hedged as the costs to hedge continued to be prohibitive due to market volatility 
in addition  the increase in revenues attributable to our natural gas and electricity and hvac business segments had a million and million impact  respectively  on cost of products sold for the year ended september  compared to the prior year 
higher natural gas and electricity costs and higher volumes were the main attributes for the increase in our natural gas and electricity segment 
for the year ended september   cost of products sold represented of revenues compared to in the prior year 
this increase results primarily from the impact of the fuel oil operations described above  as well as the continued impact of product mix with a full year of the non propane agway energy operations

all costs of operating our retail distribution and appliance sales and service operations are reported within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
these operating expenses include the compensation and benefits of field and direct operating support personnel  costs of operating and maintaining our vehicle fleet  overhead and other costs of our purchasing  training and safety departments and other direct and indirect costs of our customer service centers 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges are recorded in current period earnings within operating expenses 
operating expenses of million for the year ended september  increased million  or  compared to million in the prior year 
operating expenses for fiscal include a million unrealized non cash loss representing the net change in fair values of derivative instruments during the period  compared to a million unrealized loss in the prior year see item a in this annual report for information on our policies regarding the accounting for derivative instruments 
in addition to the non cash impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments  the most significant impact on operating expenses was the increase in employee  vehicle and facility costs reflecting a full year of agway energy operations  offset to an extent by expense savings attributable to synergies in our northeast operations and continued expense management  particularly in light of lower operating results 
additionally  fiscal operating expenses included a million non cash pension charge in order to accelerate the recognition of a portion of unrecognized actuarial losses in our defined benefit pension plan 
the accelerated recognition of these losses was recorded in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits sfas as a result of an increase in the level of lump sum benefit payments made to retirees or terminated individuals during fiscal compared to prior years 
operating expenses in fiscal increased primarily in the following areas i employee compensation and benefit costs increased a net million related to the impact of the agway energy operations  partially offset by lower variable compensation from lower earnings  ii costs to operate our fleet increased million primarily from higher fuel costs  iii operating costs at our customer service centers increased million as a result of the full year inclusion of the agway energy operations  and  iv million higher bad debt expense associated with the high energy price environment 
these increases were offset to an extent by million lower pension costs as a result of the non cash settlement charge included in fiscal operating expenses described above

all costs of our back office support functions  including compensation and benefits for executives and other support functions  as well as other costs and expenses to maintain finance and accounting  treasury  legal  human resources  corporate development and the information systems functions are reported within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended september  were million  or  lower compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decline in compensation and benefit related expenses attributable to lower variable compensation in line with lower earnings  as well as the elimination of million of costs incurred in fiscal in connection with transition services obtained on an interim basis following the agway acquisition and savings in other expense categories 
these savings were offset somewhat by a million increase in professional services fees associated primarily with our first time compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
restructuring costs and impairment of goodwill 
for the year ended september   we recorded a restructuring charge of million related primarily to employee termination costs incurred as a result of actions taken during fiscal specifically  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we approved and initiated a plan of reorganization to realign our field operations 
this realignment is expected to generate further efficiencies  realize operating synergies and reduce costs at the field operating level 
the restructuring charge consists primarily of costs associated with severance and other employee benefits for approximately positions eliminated under the plan 
during fiscal  we recorded a million restructuring charge for severance and other exit costs associated with vacating duplicative facilities and contract terminations in connection with the integration of agway energy operations and management 
additionally  during fiscal we recorded a non cash charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with our hvac segment as a result of our annual assessment of the anticipated future cash flows from that segment 
during fiscal  as a result of continued losses in one of our reporting units in our all other segment acquired in fiscal  we recorded a non cash charge of million related to goodwill impairment

net interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal the fiscal interest expense included a one time fee of million related to financing commitments for the agway acquisition 
interest expense in fiscal increased million as a result of the net effect of a full year of interest on debt used to finance the december agway acquisition  offset to an extent by lower average interest rates due to our debt refinancing on march  discontinued operations 
as part of our overall business strategy  we continually monitor and evaluate our existing operations to identify opportunities to optimize return on assets employed by selectively consolidating or divesting operations in slower growing or non strategic markets 
in line with that strategy  during fiscal  we sold customer service centers for net cash proceeds of million 
we recorded a gain on sale of million during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a gain on sale of million to reflect the finalization of certain purchase price adjustments with the buyer of the customer service centers sold in fiscal gains on sale have been accounted for within discontinued operations in accordance with sfas net loss income and ebitda 
we reported a net loss of million for the year ended september  compared to net income of million in the prior year 
reported ebitda for fiscal of million decreased million  or  compared to million in the prior year 
ebitda and net loss for fiscal were unfavorably impacted by million and million  respectively  as a result of certain significant items relating mainly to i a million loss on debt extinguishment recorded in the third quarter associated with our debt refinancing  ii a million restructuring charge attributable primarily to severance associated with the realignment of our field operations  iii a million charge attributable to impairment of goodwill associated with our hvac segment  iv a million charge included within amortization expense attributable to the impairment of other intangible assets in our hvac segment  and v million included within depreciation expense attributable to impairment of assets affected by the field realignment 
in addition to the non recurring items impacting fiscal results  the most significant negative impact on earnings was from the approximate million impact on margin opportunities in our fuel oil business from the ceiling program 
income before interest expense  loss on debt extinguishment and income taxes in our propane and natural gas and electricity segments improved million and million  respectively 
by comparison  ebitda and net income for fiscal included the net favorable impact of million and million  respectively  from the following significant items i a million gain from the sale of customer service centers in the northern and southern central regions of the united states considered to be non strategic  ii a non cash charge of million included within cost of products sold related to the settlement of futures contracts which were marked to market under purchase accounting for the agway acquisition  iii a non cash pension settlement charge of million related to accelerated recognition of actuarial losses in our defined benefit pension plan  iv a non cash charge of million attributable to impairment of goodwill related to a small business acquired in  v a million restructuring charge related to integrating certain field management and back office functions in the northeast  and vi a non cash charge of million included within depreciation expense attributable to the write down of assets to be disposed of as a result of our efforts to integrate certain northeast operations 
ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense  loss on debt extinguishment  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our management uses ebitda as a measure of liquidity and we are including it because we believe that it provides our investors and industry analysts with additional information to evaluate our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to pay our quarterly distributions to holders of our common units 
moreover  our revolving credit agreement requires us to use ebitda as a component in calculating our leverage and interest coverage ratios 
ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap 
because ebitda as determined by us excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  it may not be comparable to ebitda or similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the following table sets forth i our calculation of ebitda and ii a reconciliation of ebitda  as so calculated  to our net cash provided by operating activities dollars in thousands

total revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  driven primarily by the agway acquisition 
revenues in our propane segment of million for the year ended september  increased million  or  compared to million in the prior year 
this increase is the result of higher retail and wholesale propane sales volumes  coupled with an increase in average selling prices in line with higher commodity prices for propane 
despite nationwide average temperatures  as reported by noaa  that were warmer than normal and warmer than the prior year  retail propane gallons sold increased million gallons  or  to million gallons for the year ended september  the increase is primarily attributable to the addition of agway energy volumes from december   partially offset by the effect of the warmer temperatures 
average selling prices increased approximately as a result of sustained higher commodity prices for propane 
the average posted price of propane during fiscal increased approximately compared to the average posted prices in the prior year 
additionally  included within the propane segment are revenues from wholesale and risk management activities of million for the year ended september  which increased million  compared to the prior year

cost of products sold increased million to million for the year ended september  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase results primarily from the increase in retail propane volumes sold  as well as the addition of fuel oil and other refined fuel sales volumes  which had a combined impact of million on the year over year comparison of cost of products sold 
higher commodity prices for propane during fiscal also increased cost of products sold by million compared to the prior year 
increased wholesale and risk management activities  noted above  increased cost of products sold by million compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold for the year ended september  also included a million non cash charge associated with the settlement of futures contracts that were acquired in the agway acquisition 
as the underlying futures and option contracts were settled  the derivative assets were charged to cost of products sold as an offset to the realized gains from contract settlement 
the impact on cost of products sold represents a non cash charge resulting from the application of purchase accounting on derivative instruments acquired 
in addition  the increase in revenues attributable to our natural gas and electricity and hvac business segments had a million and million impact  respectively  on cost of products sold in the year ended september  compared to the prior year 
for the year ended september   cost of products sold represented of revenues compared to in the prior year 
this increase results primarily from the different mix of products sold during fiscal as a result of the additional product offerings from the agway energy operations

liquidity and capital resources analysis of cash flows operating activities 
due to the seasonal nature of the propane and fuel oil businesses  cash flows from operating activities are greater during the winter and spring seasons  our second and third fiscal quarters  as customers pay for propane purchased during the heating season 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended september  amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease was attributable to a million increased investment in working capital in comparison to the prior year  particularly in increased accounts receivable balances as a result of the significant rise in commodity prices  coupled with million lower income  after adjusting for non cash items in both periods depreciation  amortization  loss on debt extinguishment and gains on disposal of assets and customer service centers  offset to an extent by an increase in other long term assets and liabilities of million 
the continued high commodity price environment in both propane and fuel oil has resulted in a significant increase in average selling prices and  in turn  higher receivable balances in relation to the prior year  as well as higher average inventory costs 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million  or  to million  compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to improved net income  as well as a decrease in net working capital investment compared to the prior year 
net working capital decreased primarily as a result of an increase in customer prepayments and deposits under our budget payment programs  particularly in our fuel oil and other refined fuels segment 
under these budget payment programs  customers pay equal monthly installments beginning in june or july for the upcoming heating season based on each customer s historical usage patterns 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended september  consisted of capital expenditures of million including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations  offset by net proceeds of from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
capital spending in fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal primarily as a result of our facility integration efforts in the northeast  as well as additional spending on information technology in connection with the integration of agway energy 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended september  consisted of the net impact of the million total cost of the agway acquisition partially offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of customer service centers during fiscal and net proceeds of million from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
additionally  capital expenditures were million including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations for fiscal capital spending in fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal primarily as a result of our facility integration efforts in the northeast  as well as additional spending on information technology in connection with the integration of agway energy 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended september  of million reflects the impact of the march  debt refinancing which included the early retirement of million of private placement senior notes and a related prepayment premium of million  offset by net proceeds of million  net of a discount  from the issuance of an additional million of senior notes due bringing the total principal amount of such notes to million and borrowings of million under our new term loan see summary of long term debt obligations and revolving credit lines below 
in addition  we had borrowings of million under our revolving credit agreement in order to fund increased working capital needs during the heating season  offset by million in fees associated with closing of the march  debt refinancing and the third amended and restated credit agreement in october quarterly distributions to holders of our common units and the general partner at a rate per common unit for each quarter of fiscal amounted to million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september  was million as a result of i net proceeds of million from the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  a portion of which was used to fund a portion of the agway acquisition  and  ii net proceeds of million from a public offering of approximately million common units including full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option during december to fund a portion of the agway acquisition  offset by i the payment of a total of million for our quarterly distributions of per common unit during each of the first two quarters of fiscal  per common unit during the third quarter of fiscal and per common unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and  ii the repayment of the third annual principal installment of million due under the senior note agreement which was terminated as a result of the refinancing 
summary of long term debt obligations and revolving credit lines on october   our operating partnership executed the third amended and restated credit agreement the revolving credit agreement  which replaced the second amended and restated credit agreement then due to expire in may the revolving credit agreement extended the maturity to october  and provided available credit of million in the form of a million revolving working capital facility  of which million could be used to issue letters of credit  and a separate million letter of credit facility 
the second amended and restated credit agreement provided a million working capital facility and a million acquisition facility 
in connection with the revolving credit agreement  our permitted leverage ratio the ratio of total debt to ebitda was reduced from a ratio of to to a ratio of less than to on march   we completed a refinancing the refinancing of our operating partnership s million outstanding principal amount of senior notes due and million outstanding principal amount of senior notes due collectively  the redeemed notes 
under the refinancing  we issued million of additional notes under the indenture governing our senior notes and received proceeds of approximately million  net of a million discount on sale and related underwriter fees 
in addition  our operating partnership entered into the first amendment to the revolving credit agreement to provide  among other things  for a five year million term loan facility the term loan 
the total net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of additional senior notes under the indenture governing the senior notes and from the million of borrowings under the term loan  together with cash of approximately million  were used to prepay the redeemed notes  including a prepayment premium of approximately million and interest accrued on the redeemed notes of approximately million from the last interest payment date through the date of redemption 
the redeemed notes required an annual principal repayment of million through the refinancing replaced the annual cash requirement for principal amortization with the million five year term loan due and the million of additional senior notes due  significantly extending our debt maturities and eliminating refinancing risk associated with the amortization of the redeemed notes 
the refinancing is expected to reduce our annual interest expense for at least the next five years 
we recorded a one time charge of million for the year ended september  as a result of the refinancing to reflect the loss on debt extinguishment associated with the prepayment premium of million and the write off of million of unamortized bond issuance costs associated with the redeemed notes 
as a result of the refinancing  we eliminated our requirement under the redeemed notes to maintain a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio without adding a comparable financial covenant under the senior notes 
as a result of the first amendment to the revolving credit agreement  our operating partnership s permitted leverage ratio was reduced from a ratio of to to a ratio of less than to and the interest coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda to interest expense was amended to require maintenance of a ratio of greater than to on a consolidated basis 
the revolving credit agreement and the senior notes both contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to our operating partnership and us  respectively  including i restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  and ii restrictions on certain liens  investments  guarantees  loans  advances  payments  mergers  consolidations  distributions  sales of assets and other transactions 
we were in compliance with all covenants and terms of all of our debt agreements as of september  and as of the end of each fiscal quarter for all periods presented 
on august   we completed the second amendment to the revolving credit agreement pursuant to which the lenders i eliminated the stand alone million letter of credit facility and combined that credit with the existing revolving working capital facility  ii increased the revolving working capital facility by an additional million  thereby raising the amount of the working capital facility from million to million including the million from the former stand alone letter of credit facility  iii extended the revolving credit facility s expiration date to match the march  maturity date of the million term loan  and  iv amended certain other terms to effect the foregoing 
all other terms and conditions under the revolving credit agreement remained the same 
as of september   there was million outstanding under the working capital facility of the revolving credit agreement that was used to fund working capital requirements 
the senior notes mature on december   and require semi annual interest payments that began on june  we are permitted to redeem some or all of the senior notes any time on or after december   at redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the senior notes 
in addition  embedded within the senior notes is a change of control provision that would require us to offer to repurchase the notes at of the principal amount repurchased  if the holders of the notes elected to exercise the right of repurchase 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  including the term loan  bear interest at a rate based upon either libor or wachovia national bank s prime rate  plus  in each case  the applicable margin or the federal funds rate plus of 
an annual facility fee ranging from to  based upon certain financial tests  is payable quarterly whether or not borrowings occur 
in connection with the term loan  our operating partnership also entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of million with the issuing lender 
effective march  through march   our operating partnership will pay a fixed interest rate of to the issuing lender on notional principal amount of million  effectively fixing the libor portion of the interest rate at 
in return  the issuing lender will pay to our operating partnership a floating rate  namely libor  on the same notional principal amount 
the applicable margin above libor  as defined in the revolving credit agreement  is not included in  and will be paid in addition to  this fixed interest rate of 
partnership distributions we will make distributions in an amount equal to all of our available cash  as defined in our second amended and restated partnership agreement the partnership agreement  approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates 
our board of supervisors reviews the level of available cash on a quarterly basis based upon information provided by management 
during fiscal  we paid quarterly distributions to our common unitholders of per common unit 
on october   our board of supervisors declared a quarterly distribution of per common unit in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was paid on november  to holders of record on november  quarterly distributions include incentive distribution rights idrs payable to the general partner to the extent the quarterly distribution exceeds per common unit 
the idrs represent an incentive for the general partner which is majority owned by senior management of the partnership to increase the distributions to common unitholders in excess of per common unit 
with regard to the first of the common unit distribution  of the available cash is distributed to the common unitholders and is distributed to the general partner 
with regard to the balance of the common unit distributions paid  of the available cash is distributed to the common unitholders and is distributed to the general partner 
pension plan assets and obligations while our pension asset portfolio has experienced significantly improved asset returns over the past three fiscal years  the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan continues to be affected by the negative impact of the low interest rate environment on the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligations  as well as the cumulative impact of prior losses particularly during fiscal and fiscal the projected benefit obligation as of september  exceeded the market value of pension plan assets by million  an increase of million compared to the million underfunded position at the end of the prior year 
our defined benefit pension plan was frozen to new participants effective january  and  in furtherance of our effort to minimize future increases in our benefit obligations  effective january   all future service credits were eliminated 
therefore  eligible participants will receive interest credits only toward their ultimate defined benefit under the defined benefit pension plan 
there were no minimum funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plan during fiscal  or however  in an effort to proactively address our funded status  we elected to make voluntary contributions to our defined benefit pension plan of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these voluntary contributions  coupled with improved asset returns in our pension asset portfolio during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  partially offset the negative effects on the funded status of further declines in the interest rate environment 
in addition  during fiscal lump sum benefit payments to either terminated or retired individuals of million exceeded the interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost 
as a result  pursuant to sfas we recorded a non cash settlement charge of million in order to accelerate recognition of a portion of cumulative unrecognized losses in the defined benefit pension plan 
these unrecognized losses were previously accumulated as a reduction to partners capital and were being amortized to expense as part of our net periodic pension cost in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions 
as of september   the cumulative reduction to partners capital decreased to million  compared to million at the end of fiscal  primarily as a result of continued strength in our asset portfolio returns  offset to an extent by lower benchmark interest rates 
the cumulative reduction to partners capital is attributable to the level of unrealized losses experienced on our pension assets over the past several years and represents non cash charges to our partners capital with no impact on the results of operations for the year ended september  additional pension settlement charges may be required in future periods depending on the level of lump sum benefit payments 
there can be no assurance that future declines in capital markets  or interest rates  will not have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flow 
for purposes of computing the actuarial valuation of projected benefit obligations  we reduced the discount rate assumption from as of september  to as of september  to reflect current market expectations related to long term interest rates and the projected duration of our pension obligations based on a benchmark index with similar characteristics as the expected cash flow requirements of our defined benefit pension plan over the long term 
additionally  for purposes of the computation of the periodic pension cost for fiscal  and we assumed declining long term rates of return on plan assets of  and  respectively  based on the investment mix of our pension asset portfolio  historical asset performance and expectations for future performance 
there are currently no minimum funding requirements projected for fiscal and  based on information provided by our actuaries  we do not project any minimum funding requirements until fiscal we also provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees 
partnership employees who were hired prior to july and retired prior to march are eligible for such benefits if they reached a specified retirement age while working for the partnership 
effective january   we terminated our postretirement benefit plan for all eligible employees retiring after march  all active and eligible employees who were to receive benefits under the postretirement plan subsequent to march  were provided a settlement by increasing their accumulated benefits under the defined benefit pension plan noted above 
our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans are unfunded 
long term debt obligations and operating lease obligations contractual obligations long term debt obligations and future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements as of september  are due as follows dollars in thousands

additionally  we have standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  in support of retention levels under our casualty insurance programs and certain lease obligations  which expire periodically through october  off balance sheet arrangements operating leases we lease certain property  plant and equipment for various periods under noncancelable operating leases  including the majority of our railroad tank cars  approximately of our vehicle fleet  approximately of our customer service centers and portions of our information systems equipment 
rental expense under operating leases was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements as of september  are presented in the table above 
guarantees we have residual value guarantees associated with certain of our operating leases  related primarily to transportation equipment  with remaining lease periods scheduled to expire periodically through fiscal upon completion of the lease period  we guarantee that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed the guaranteed amount  or we will pay the lessor the difference 
although the fair value of equipment at the end of its lease term has historically exceeded the guaranteed amounts  the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments we could be required to make under these leasing arrangements  assuming the equipment is deemed worthless at the end of the lease term  is approximately million 
of this amount  the fair value of residual value guarantees for operating leases entered into after december  is reflected in other liabilities  with a corresponding amount included within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet totaling million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
recently issued accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as a legal obligation to retire an asset when the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of the conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective beginning with the partnership s fiscal year ending september  the partnership is currently evaluating the provisions of fin and currently believes that adoption will not have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows

sfas r is a revision of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
sfas r eliminates the alternative of using the apb opinion no 
intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided for in sfas no 
as originally issued and requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas r is effective beginning with the partnership s fiscal year ending september  the partnership has historically recognized unearned compensation associated with awards of equity instruments ratably to expense over the vesting period see note 
accordingly  adoption of sfas r is not expected to have an impact on the partnership s consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of september   we were a party to exchange traded futures and option contracts  forward contracts and in certain instances  over the counter options collectively derivative instruments to manage the price risk associated with future purchases of the commodities used in our operations  principally propane and fuel oil 
futures and forward contracts require that we sell or acquire propane or fuel oil at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
an option contract allows  but does not require  its holder to buy or sell propane or fuel oil at a specified price during a specified time period  the writer of an option contract must fulfill the obligation of the option contract  should the holder choose to exercise the option 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of the product to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then current price and the fixed contract price 
the contracts are entered into in anticipation of market movements and to manage and hedge exposure to fluctuating prices of propane and fuel oil  as well as to help ensure the availability of product during periods of high demand 
market risk we are subject to commodity price risk to the extent that propane or fuel oil market prices deviate from fixed contract settlement amounts 
futures traded with brokers of the nymex require daily cash settlements in margin accounts 
forward and option contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term either by physical delivery or through a net settlement mechanism 
market risks associated with the trading of futures  options and forward contracts are monitored daily for compliance with our hedging and risk management policy which includes volume limits for open positions 
open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices 
credit risk futures and fuel oil options are guaranteed by the nymex and  as a result  have minimal credit risk 
we are subject to credit risk with forward and option contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform 
we evaluate the financial condition of each counterparty with which we conduct business and establish credit limits to reduce exposure to credit risk of non performance 
interest rate risk a portion of our long term borrowings bear interest at a variable rate based upon either libor or wachovia national bank s prime rate  plus an applicable margin depending on the level of our total leverage 
therefore  we are subject to interest rate risk on the variable component of the interest rate 
we manage our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
on march   we entered into a million interest rate swap contract in conjunction with the new term loan facility under the revolving credit agreement 
the interest rate swap is being accounted for under sfas and has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recognized in other comprehensive loss income oci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
at september   the fair value of the interest rate swap was million and was included within other liabilities 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we account for derivative instruments in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas 
all derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet  within other current assets or other current liabilities  at their fair values 
fair values for forward contracts and futures are derived from quoted market prices for similar instruments traded on the nymex 
on the date that futures  forward and option contracts are entered into  we make a determination as to whether the derivative instrument qualifies for designation as a hedge 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current period earnings or oci  depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if it is  the type of hedge 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we formally assess  both at the hedge contract s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in oci to the extent effective and reclassified into cost of products sold during the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings 
the mark to market gains or losses on ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in cost of products sold immediately 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges are recorded in current period earnings within operating expenses 
a portion of our option contracts are not classified as hedges and  as such  changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized within operating expenses as they occur 
the value of certain option contracts that do qualify as hedges and are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas have two components of value time value and intrinsic value 
the intrinsic value is the value by which the option is in the money ie  the amount by which the value of the commodity exceeds the exercise or strike price of the option 
the remaining amount of option value is attributable to time value 
we do not include the time value of option contracts in our assessment of hedge effectiveness and  therefore  record changes in the time value component of the options currently in earnings 
at september   the fair value of derivative instruments described above resulted in derivative assets of million included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and derivative liabilities of million included within other current liabilities 
for the year ended september  operating expenses include unrealized non cash losses of million compared to unrealized non cash losses of million for the year ended september   attributable to the change in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges 
as of september   there were no unrealized gains or losses attributable to commodity hedging transaction included within oci 
sensitivity analysis in an effort to estimate our exposure to unfavorable market price changes in propane or fuel oil related to our open positions under derivative instruments  we developed a model that incorporates the following data and assumptions

above were adjusted adversely by a hypothetical change in the future periods and compared to the fixed contract settlement amounts in a

based on the sensitivity analysis described above  the hypothetical adverse change in market prices for each of the future months for which a future  forward and or option contract exists indicate a reduction in potential future gains of million as of september  the above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario 
actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio 
the average posted price of propane on september  at mont belvieu  texas a major storage point was per gallon as compared to per gallon on september  the average posted price of fuel oil on september  at linden  new jersey was per gallon as compared to per gallon on september  since the end of fiscal  both propane and fuel oil average posted prices have declined approximately to per gallon and per gallon  respectively  on november  as of september   our open position portfolio reflected a net short position sell contracts aggregating million
