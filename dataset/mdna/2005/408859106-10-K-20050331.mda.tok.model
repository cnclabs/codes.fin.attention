item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview the company is engaged exclusively in the apparel business which is conducted through two wholly owned subsidiaries hampshire designers  which primarily designs and sells women s and men s sweaters  and item eyes  which designs and sells a broad line of women s woven and knit related separates 
the company sells to approximately retail customers  primarily in the united states 
the company is a major supplier to the moderate price sector of most major department stores and mass merchants 
the company also sells many specialty retail store chains and catalog companies 
five major customers  belk s department stores  federated department stores  jc penney company  kohl s department stores and may department stores  accounted for approximately of the company s sales for the year ended december  women s sweaters are marketed under the company s labels  designers originals r and designers originals studio r and private labels of its customers 
the company historically produced and marketed a classic styled sweater  however  demand has shifted over the past several years with the majority of growth occurring in fashion design and embellished sweaters and tops that can only be sourced internationally due to the extensive hand labor required to manufacture such garments 
sales of women s sweaters  including sweaters marketed by item eyes  accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in men s sweaters accounted for approximately of net sales of the company in during  market demand for men s sweaters was relatively flat  however  the company s bookings experienced a significant shift in volume from private label to its branded offerings  resulting in an increase in market share of all of its brands 
management believes the introduction of multiple men s products in the owned branded offerings will provide an opportunity for increased market share in item eyes produces women s products 
in  the trend in product mix for item eyes shifted with a decrease in the demand for jackets  which was offset by an approximately equal increase in the sale of sweaters 
sales of jackets by item eyes during decreased to less than of annual sales while sweaters increased to approximately of annual sales 
during  the demand for jackets accelerated and sales of jackets approximated of annual net sales while the sweater category also increased to 
the company outsources the manufacture of its products  principally due to lower labor costs 
the products sold by the company are purchased from manufacturers throughout the world through its established international sourcing network  with the majority of manufacturers being located in southeast asia 
with the company s dependence on international sources  the failure of any of these manufacturers to ship products to the company in a timely manner  failure of the manufacturers to meet required quality standards or delays in the shipments including clearing united states customs could cause the company to miss delivery dates to its customers 
the failure to make timely deliveries could expose the company to liability to its customers resulting in customers either canceling the orders or demanding reduced prices for late delivery 
the company believes its greatest risk is the uncertainty arising from the elimination on january  of quotas on imported products established by the world trade organization see discussion under governmental regulation and trade agreements above and the impact that this change will have on international trade  particularly the apparel industry 
the uncertainty includes any action that may be taken by the united states government in the event that the increased quantity of imported apparel is determined to be a market disruption in the united states 
the company placed orders with delivery dates early in the year to minimize any disruption in supply of its products 
the results in were affected by the highly competitive conditions in the retail apparel market 
in the women s sweater business  sales decreased  while margins were flat  compared to the prior year 
the company expects pressure on margins to continue throughout sales of men s products were relatively flat  but margins increased due to stronger sell through in the retail market which resulted in reduced markdown allowances 
disposal of investment company on october   the company disposed of its investment subsidiary  hampshire investments  limited hil  after the board of directors the board determined that the company should concentrate on the apparel business

the ability of the company to compete is enhanced by its established international sourcing relationships and its strong financial position with significant liquid assets and relatively low debt to equity ratio

over the past five years  the retail industry has consolidated through acquisitions and mergers 
further  retailers have concentrated more volume with a fewer number of vendors

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for markdowns  customer returns and adjustments  doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income taxes payable 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  management believes that its estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable and that the actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowances for customer returns and adjustments the company reserves allowances for customer returns  trade discounts  customer chargebacks  and for sales and markdown allowances given to the customer at the end of the selling seasons  which enable customers to markdown the retail sales prices 
the estimates for these allowances and discounts are based on a number of factors  including a historical experience  b industry trends  and c specific agreements or negotiated amounts with customers 
further  while the company believes that it has negotiated all substantial sales and markdown allowances with its customers for the season recently completed  additional allowances for the spring season are anticipated and have been provided for and others may be requested by customers for the concluded seasons 
likewise  should the financial condition of the company s customers or other parties improve and result in payments or favorable settlements of previously reserved amounts  the company may reduce its recorded allowances 
reserves for doubtful accounts of customers the company maintains reserves for doubtful accounts of customers 
the estimates for these reserves are based on aging of the trade accounts receivable and specific information obtained by the company on the financial condition and current credit worthiness of customers 
certain high risk customer accounts are factored with financial institutions or the company purchases credit insurance for a portion of such accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate and impair the ability of the customers to make payments on their accounts  the company may be required to increase its allowances by recording additional reserve for doubtful accounts 
inventory reserves the company analyzes out of season merchandise on an individual sku basis to determine reserves  if any  that may be required to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value 
additionally  the company provides reserves for current season merchandise whose carrying value is expected  based on historical experience  to exceed its net realizable value 
factors considered in evaluating the requirement for reserves include product styling  color  current fashion trends and quantities on hand 
some of the company s products are classics and remain saleable from one season to the next and therefore no reserves are generally required on these products 
an estimate is made of the market value  less expense to dispose and a normal profit margin  of products whose value is determined to be impaired 
if these products are ultimately sold at less than estimated amounts  additional reserves may be required 
likewise  if these products are sold for more than estimated amounts  reserves may be reduced
