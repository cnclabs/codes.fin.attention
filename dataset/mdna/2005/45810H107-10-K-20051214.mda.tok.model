the company has an established domestic and international customer base that includes government and commercial satellite operators  spacecraft and payload manufacturers  and aerospace systems integrators 
the company has developed innovative software products that reduce the cost and minimize the development risk associated with traditional custom built systems 
the company believes that it was the first to offer a comprehensive cots software product line for command and control 
as a systems integrator  the company leverages these products to provide turnkey satellite control facilities that can operate multiple satellites from most manufacturers 
these systems offer significant cost savings for customers that have traditionally purchased a separate custom control center for each of their satellites 

table of contents through its wholly owned subsidiary sat  acquired in august  the company also offers turnkey systems and software for satellite and terrestrial communications signal monitoring 
in march  the company formed a wholly owned subsidiary  isi europe  with headquarters in toulouse  france 
isi europe serves as the focal point for the support of all of integral s european business 
on january   the company acquired newpoint 
newpoint provides equipment monitoring and control software to satellite operators and the telecommunications industry 
in october  the company acquired rt logic 
rt logic manufactures satellite communications equipment and systems  principally for military applications 
this equipment is used in satellite tracking stations  control centers  spacecraft factories  and range facilities 
in july  the company acquired the intellectual property rights  inventory and certain other assets of the former jackson tull satellite ground systems division 
the acquisition was an extension of the satellite ground systems business segment and enabled the company to be a turnkey provider of full motion antennas and rf systems used for tracking low earth orbiting satellites and launch vehicles as well as aeronautical telemetry range operations 
effective november   the company disposed of the intellectual property rights  inventory and certain other assets of antenna systems division to ljt associates  inc of montgomery  alabama ljt

under the asset purchase agreement  the company will continue to fulfill its obligations under existing customer contracts but will look to ljt as a subcontractor to perform the actual work 
the company did not record a material gain or a loss as a result of this transaction 
on october   lumistar  inc  a newly formed subsidiary of rt logic  acquired substantially all of the assets of lumistar  llc 
through this indirect wholly owned subsidiary  the company provides system level and board level telemetry products 
contract revenue the company generates revenue under three types of contracts fixed price  cost plus  and time and material t m contracts 
under a fixed price contract  the company is paid a stipulated price for services or products and bears the risk of increased or unexpected costs 
revenue under a fixed price contract is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
under a cost plus contract  the company is reimbursed for allowable costs within the contractual terms and conditions and is paid a negotiated fee 
the fee may be fixed or based on performance incentives 
revenue recognition under a cost plus contract is based upon actual costs incurred and a pro rata amount of the negotiated fee 
under a t m contract  the company receives fixed hourly rates intended to cover salary costs attributable to work performed on the contract and related overhead expenses  reimbursement for other direct costs and a profit 
revenue is recognized under a t m contract at the contractual rates as labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
to date  the vast majority of contracts for the purchase of the company s cots software products have been fixed priced in nature  either firm fixed price contracts or t m contracts with fixed labor rates 
the company earns revenues from sales of its products and services through contracts that are funded by the us government as well as commercial and international organizations 
the company may be either a prime contractor directly to the end user of its products and services or it may act as a subcontractor under a contract with another contractor 

table of contents the percentages of revenues received by the company from prime contracts and subcontracts for fiscal years  and are as follows contract source fiscal year prime contract subcontract for a given contract  the revenue mix may include the company s cots software products  pass through of third party hardware and software and services provided by the company or its subcontractors 
the following table summarizes the percentage of revenues attributable to each contract type for the period indicated contract type fiscal year cost plus fixed price time and materials sale of software products most of the company s contracts include the sale of proprietary software products 
sales of the company s software products take many forms 
the company sells software only a software only sale  software and services together or software  services and hardware together 
in addition  depending on a customer s requirements  the company may or may not provide post contract customer support pcs 
the company s recognition of revenue for sales of software products depends on customer requirements and the nature of the contracts involved 
in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  for a software only sale  the company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
in situations where software is sold together with services and or hardware  the company recognizes software license revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
the company recognizes pcs revenue on a percentage of completion basis when pcs is part of a broader fixed price contract that includes software and services 
alternatively  when pcs services ie  software maintenance and support are awarded to the company under a separate maintenance contract  the company recognizes pcs revenue on a straight line basis pro rata over the term of the maintenance contract 
during fiscal year  the company incurred approximately million in research and development r d costs in connection with software and hardware products 
the company incurred approximately million in related r d costs in fiscal year and million in fiscal year backlog the company s estimated backlog is as follows in thousands sept 
 sept 
 sept 
 outstanding commitments general commitments total represents orders that are firm and funded 
represents principally unexercised options on existing contracts 
fiscal years and have been restated to include certain unfunded contract options not previously counted 

table of contents the increase in backlog between fiscal and fiscal relates primarily to backlog in the ground systems government segment 
the decrease in backlog between fiscal and fiscal relates to a decrease in the ground systems government segment which was partially offset by increased bookings at both space communications systems and the ground systems commercial segments 
under outstanding commitments  the company agrees to provide specific services  frequently over an extended period of time  with continued performance of those services  contingent upon the customer s decision to exercise options on an existing contract 
general commitments consist of contract options and sole source business that management believes likely to be exercised or awarded in connection with existing contracts 
contract options are the company s contractual agreement to perform specifically defined services only in the event the customer thereafter requests the company to do so 
sole source business refers to contract work which the company reasonably expects to be awarded based on its unique expertise in a specific area or because it has previously done all such work in that area for the customer or prime contractor who will award the contract 
the company estimates that of backlog as of september  will be completed during fiscal year estimated backlog includes contract options through september  including general commitments 
many of the company s contracts are multi year contracts and contracts with option years  and portions of these contracts are carried forward from one year to the next as part of the company s contract backlog 
the company s total contract backlog represents management s estimate of the aggregate unearned revenues expected to be earned by the company over the life of all of its contracts  including option periods 
because many factors affect the scheduling of projects  there can be no assurance as to when revenues will be realized on projects included in the company s backlog 
in addition  although contract backlog represents only business which is considered to be firm  there can be no assurance that cancellations or scope adjustments will not occur 
the majority of backlog represents contracts under the terms of which cancellation by the customer would entitle the company to all or a portion of its costs incurred and potential fees to the date of cancellation 
however  the company also believes that backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenues 
the company s backlog typically is subject to large variations from quarter to quarter as existing contracts are renewed or new contracts are awarded 
additionally  all us government contracts included in backlog may be terminated at the convenience of the government 
critical accounting policies the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition the company provides services under fixed price contracts for which revenue is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of actual costs incurred to total costs estimated over the duration of the contract 
these estimates regarding costs underlie the company s determinations as to overall contract profitability and the timing of revenue recognition 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then actual results may differ from projected results and losses on contracts may need to be recognized 
the company accounts for cost reimbursable contracts by charging contract costs to operations as incurred and recognizing contract revenues and profits by applying the negotiated fee and or estimated award fee rate to actual costs on an individual contract basis 
management reviews contract performance  costs incurred  and estimated completion costs regularly and adjusts revenues and profits on contracts in the period in which changes become determinable 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause the company s operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of individual accounts receivable balances  including the credit worthiness of each customer and the period in which customers financial condition deteriorate and they are no longer able to pay the balances owed to the company 
to the extent the company does not recognize deterioration in its customers financial condition in the period it occurs  or to the extent the company overestimates its customers ability to pay  the amount of bad debt expense recognized in a given reporting period will be impacted 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company s acquisitions of other companies have resulted in the acquisition of certain intangible assets and goodwill 
goodwill is subject to impairment to the extent the company s operations experience significant negative results 
these negative results can be the result of the company s individual operations or negative trends in the company s industry or in the general economy  which impact the company 
to the extent the company s goodwill is determined to be impaired  then these balances are written down to their estimated fair value on the date of the impairment 
the company conducts an annual review for impairment and determining when and if an impairment has occurred involves a significant amount of judgment 
management bases its judgment on a number of factors including viability of the businesses acquired  their integration into the company s operations  the market in which those businesses operate and their projected future results  cash flow projections  and numerous other factors 
the results reported in any given period could be impacted by management s determination as to when an impairment has occurred 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas revised  shared based payment 
sfas r addresses the requirements of an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost of such award will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
the company will be required to adopt this statement during the first quarter of fiscal year as of september   the company had  unvested share based payments outstanding 
in addition  the company does not intend to issue stock option awards for the foreseeable future 
therefore  the company believes that the adoption of sfas r will not have a material impact on its future operations and financial reporting

revenue increases of approximately  for the company s ground systems commercial segment resulted from increased revenue in newpoint and the command control units resulting from increased order bookings and increased system shipments which were offset by revenue decreases at sat 
revenue increases for the company s space communications systems segment resulted from increased bookings and increased product shipments for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the fiscal year ended september  in the company s corporate segment  revenues for the product group decreased approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the fiscal year ended september  principally due to decreased license revenue

table of contents the company s on going contract with the malaysian military for the delivery of two antenna systems 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for more information regarding the disposition of the antenna systems division 
the company disbanded its i t division during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and accordingly  no revenues or costs were recorded for this division during fiscal year cost of revenue gross margin the company computes gross margin by subtracting cost of revenue from revenue 
included in cost of revenue are direct labor expenses  overhead charges associated with the company s direct labor base and other costs that can be directly related to specific contract cost objectives  such as travel  consultants  equipment  subcontracts and other direct costs 
gross margins on contract revenues vary depending on the type of product or service provided 
generally  license revenues related to the sale of the company s cots products have the greatest gross margins because of the minimal associated marginal costs to produce 
by contrast  gross margins for equipment and subcontract pass throughs seldom exceed 
engineering service gross margins typically range between and 
these definitions and ratios generally apply across all segments  although margins on equipment costs for the space communications systems segment are generally greater than the equipment margins in the other segments because that segment s business is composed of internally developed hardware products

table of contents the decreased gross margin in the company s ground systems government segment approximately  primarily relates to a lower percentage of fixed price revenue compared to cost reimbursable revenue in the segment s revenue mix for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the fiscal year ended september  the company generally earns higher margins on its fixed price contracts than its cost reimbursable type contracts because of the greater risk associated with fixed price efforts 
many of the company s new awards with the us air force have been cost reimbursable type contract vehicles 
the higher gross margin approximately  for the company s ground systems commercial segment is primarily attributable to increased revenue of approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the fiscal year ended september  both newpoint and the command and control unit in this segment posted increased gross margins due to increased revenue for the current year 
sat s gross margin decreased by approximately  on a year to year basis due to revenue declines of approximately  the space communications system segment experienced an increase in gross margin of approximately  on increased revenue of approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the fiscal year ended september  the segment s gross margin percentage declined from for the fiscal year ended september  to for the fiscal year ended september  due to a considerably greater mix of third party equipment costs in the segment s cost of revenue in the current fiscal year than in the fiscal year ended september  similar to the company s other business segments  the space communications systems segment typically earns less gross margin on third party equipment purchases than on other cost elements 
further  the segment had a significantly higher percentage of production type revenue during fiscal year than in fiscal year generally  production type contracts generate higher gross margins due to increased cost efficiencies as compared to non production oriented jobs 
in the corporate segment  the product group experienced a decrease in gross margin of approximately million on a period to period basis principally because of decreased license revenue 
further  effective april   the company determined that its epoch ips product line was substantially complete and therefore costs associated with the product were no longer eligible for capitalization 
the costs of software bug fixes and support were higher in the second half of the fiscal year than similar costs incurred during the second half of the fiscal year ended september   thereby further contributing to the lower gross margin 
although the antenna division was able to reduce its gross margin deficit by approximately  the antenna division nonetheless recorded an approximate  gross margin deficit during the fiscal year ended september  contract overruns for the division have continued on three of the unit s four remaining contracts 
the company believes that all four of these contracts will be completed by the first quarter of fiscal year with the exception of warranty obligations  costs for such warranty obligations are reflected in the cost to complete estimates 
the company expects no further losses from antenna contracts in fiscal year the i t division posted no gross margins as it had no revenue or costs during the current year

all units in the company s ground systems commercial segment experienced increased revenues on a year to year basis 
revenue levels for the core business command control unit  sat and newpoint were up  and respectively in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and generally relate to increased bookings and increased shipments of new orders 
the ground systems commercial segment sells primarily to commercial satellite operators and commercial satellite users where market conditions have been depressed during the past few years 
the company believes that these markets are beginning to economically improve  as evidenced by the revenue increases in fiscal year  and if this improvement continues  the company believes that the segment should be able to post continued revenue gains in future fiscal periods 
the company is also currently proposing both sat and newpoint products on several outstanding government bids

no assurances can be given that the future results indicated  whether expressed or implied  will be achieved 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
while the company believes that these statements are and will be accurate  a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations 
table of contents expressed in the company s statements 
the company s business is dependent upon general economic conditions and upon various conditions specific to its industry  and future trends cannot be predicted with certainty 
particular risks and uncertainties that may affect the company s business  other than those described elsewhere herein  include the following a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts or subcontracts funded by the us government  which are subject to termination without cause  government regulations and audits  competitive bidding  and the budget and funding process of the us government 
the presence of competitors with greater financial resources and their strategic response to the company s new services 
the potential obsolescence of the company s services due to the introduction of new technologies 
the response of customers to the company s marketing strategies and services 
the company s commercial contracts are subject to strict performance and other requirements 
the intense competition in the satellite ground system industry could harm the company s financial performance 
with respect to the company s acquisition strategy  integration of the companies and assets the company has acquired or  if the company is able to identify and acquire one or more businesses  may acquire  may be costly and may result in a decrease in the value of the company s common stock 
the company may not have adequately assessed the risks inherent in the companies or assets it has acquired or correctly assessed the potential contribution of those companies or assets to its financial performance  and in the future the company may not adequately assess the risks inherent in a particular acquisition candidate or correctly assess the candidate s potential contribution to the company s financial performance 
the company may need to divert more management resources to integration of an acquired business or assets than it planned  which may adversely affect its ability to pursue other more profitable activities 
the difficulties of integrating an acquired business or assets may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  integrating personnel with disparate backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
the company may not eliminate as many redundant costs as it anticipated in selecting the companies or assets it has acquired or may acquire 
the companies or assets the company has acquired or may acquire may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that the company failed to discover through its diligence prior to the acquisition 
changes in activity levels in the company s core markets 
the company may not be able to effectively manage any continued growth 
the business is subject to risks associated with international transactions 
the company depends upon intellectual property rights and risk having its rights infringed 
the estimated backlog is not necessarily indicative of revenues that will actually be realized under the contracts 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the market price of the company s common stock may be volatile 
these forward looking statements are based upon a variety of assumptions relating to the business of the company  which may not be realized 
because of the number and range of the assumptions underlying the company s forward looking statements  many of which are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies beyond the 
table of contents reasonable control of the company  some of the assumptions inevitably will not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur subsequent to the date of this document 
these forward looking statements are based on current information and expectation  and the company assumes no obligation to update 
therefore  the actual experience of the company and the results achieved during the period covered by any particular forward looking statement should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that these estimates will be realized  and actual results may vary materially 
there can be no assurance that any of these expectations will be realized or that any of the forward looking statements contained herein will prove to be accurate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk while the company currently does not have significant european operations  its customer base is expanding outside the us and therefore certain contracts now and in the future will likely be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as foreign currency exchange rates for contracts denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
to mitigate the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the company may periodically hedge this risk by entering into forward foreign currency contracts 
as of september   virtually all of the company s contracts were denominated in us dollars  and the company did not have any outstanding hedge agreements 
as the company enters into new foreign currency based contracts in the future  it may employ similar hedging contracts
