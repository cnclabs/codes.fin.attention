item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview we believe that was a very good year for the economy  for the staffing industry and for kelly services 
economic conditions strengthened  both in the united states and abroad 
in the us  over two million new jobs were created  nearly of which were accounted for by temporary staffing 
the unemployment rate improved to and gdp growth accelerated as compared to the prior year 
the global economy also posted impressive gains growing at the fastest rate since worldwide employment also grew  with temporary employment in europe growing faster than employment in general 
sales improved in all three of kelly s business segments and across virtually all of our service offerings 
fee income increased sharply both in temporary to permanent and direct placement  an important confirmation that business confidence is building and permanent hiring is increasing 
with the recession behind us  we re engaged our strategic growth plan and resumed filling out our branch network 
our us commercial staffing segment continued to expand its product offerings 
our ptsa segment expanded professional and technical businesses into more countries 
and  our international segment resumed geographic expansion  opening in hungary  our th country 
kelly services returned to double digit sales growth  set a new sales record  controlled expenses  improved operating efficiencies  quadrupled earnings and continued to invest for the longer term 
results of operations versus revenue from services for totaled billion  an increase of from this was the result of an increase in hours worked of and an increase in average hourly bill rates of 
revenue from services increased in each of the company s three business segments us commercial staffing  ptsa and international 
during the past year  the us dollar declined in comparison to many foreign currencies  including the euro and british pound 
as a result  kelly s us dollar translated revenue from services was higher than would have otherwise been reported 
on a constant currency basis  revenue from services increased as compared with the prior year 
the table below summarizes the impact of foreign exchange adjustments on revenue from services for on a week reported basis revenue from services weeks weeks change in millions of dollars us commercial staffing ptsa international constant currency revenue from services constant currency foreign currency impact revenue from services in addition  the fiscal year includes a rd week 
this fiscal leap year occurs every five or six years and is necessary to align the fiscal and calendar periods 
on a constant currency adjusted week basis  revenue increased 
management believes these measurements are an important analytical tool to aid in understanding underlying operating trends without distortion due to currency fluctuations and the extra week included in the fiscal year 
constant currency results are calculated by translating the current year results at prior year average exchange rates 
adjusted week revenue is calculated by excluding the last week of the fiscal year 
the table below summarizes the impact of foreign exchange adjustments on revenue from services for on a week adjusted basis revenue from services reported revenue weeks less rd week revenue adjusted revenue weeks reported revenue weeks change us commercial staffing ptsa international constant currency revenue from services constant currency foreign currency impact revenue from services gross profit of million was higher than gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in  and decreased percentage point compared to the rate recorded in the prior year 
this reflected decreases in the gross profit rates of ptsa and international  partially offset by an increase in the gross profit rate of us commercial staffing 
the decrease in the gross profit rate was due to higher state unemployment taxes  to the extent not fully recovered through pricing actions and temporary staffing gross profit rate decreases in europe  partially offset by lower workers compensation costs and improved fee based recruitment income 
the decrease in workers compensation costs compared to resulted from favorable comparisons to last year 
in  the company revised its estimate of the cost of outstanding workers compensation claims and  accordingly  recorded additional expense of million 
state unemployment taxes are expected to continue to increase in  however  the company has been recovering most of these additional costs by re pricing customer contracts 
fee based recruitment income  which represents approximately one percent of the company s total revenue  has a significant impact on gross profit rates 
there are very low direct costs of services associated with fee based recruitment income 
therefore  increases or decreases can have a disproportionate impact on gross profit rates 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million were higher than last year 
selling  general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues were in  a percentage point decrease compared to the rate in as measured on a constant currency basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased compared to the prior year 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due primarily to growth in salaries  retirement programs and incentive based compensation 
net interest expense for was thousand  compared to thousand in the change is primarily attributable to higher average short term debt levels and lower average cash balances as a result of increased working capital requirements 
earnings before taxes were million  an increase of from earnings before taxes averaged of revenues in and of revenues in the effective income tax rate for was  a decrease from last year s rate of 
last year s rate was higher primarily because it included the impact of establishing valuation allowances for certain international tax loss carryforwards

year over year revenue comparisons reflect increases of in the first quarter  in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
on an adjusted week basis  revenue from services increased year over year and on an adjusted week basis  fourth quarter revenue from services increased year over year 
us commercial staffing revenue from services represented of total company revenue from services for and for us commercial staffing earnings from operations totaled million for compared to earnings of million last year  an increase of 
the increase in earnings from operations was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue and a percentage point increase in the gross profit rate  partially offset by a increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in the gross profit rate was primarily due to lower workers compensation costs and higher fee based income  partially offset by higher state unemployment taxes  to the extent not fully recovered through pricing actions 
of the million additional workers compensation charge in reported above  million was charged to u 
s 
commercial staffing 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by as compared to the prior year and  as a percentage of revenues  were for and for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to the growth in salaries  retirement programs and incentive based compensation 
professional  technical and staffing alternatives revenue from services in the ptsa segment for the weeks in totaled billion  an increase of compared to the million reported for the weeks in this reflected a increase in hours worked and a increase in average hourly bill rates in the professional and technical businesses 
revenues in the staffing alternatives businesses  which include staff leasing  management services  hrfirst and vendor management services  increased by compared to year over year revenue comparisons reflect increases of in the first quarter  in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
on an adjusted week basis  revenue from services increased year over year and on an adjusted week basis  fourth quarter revenue from services increased year over year 
ptsa revenues from services represented of total company revenues in and during  nearly all ptsa business units exhibited double digit revenue growth as compared to kelly law registry  kelly engineering resources  hrfirst and vendor management services reported particularly strong growth 
however  kelly home care  kelly automotive services group and kelly staff leasing experienced revenue declines during as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in kelly automotive services group was consistent with the industry trend in its staffing sector 
the revenue decline at kelly staff leasing reflects intended changes in customer mix to properly position this business unit with a stronger customer base in ptsa earnings from operations for totaled million and increased from the same period in this was the result of the increase in revenue from services  partially offset by a percentage point decrease in the gross profit rate and a increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily due to decreases in the kelly home care business unit and higher workers compensation expense in the kelly staff leasing business unit 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased salaries and incentive based compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were for and for international translated us dollar revenue from services in the international segment for the weeks in totaled billion  a increase compared to the billion reported for the weeks in this resulted from an increase in hours worked of and a increase in the translated us dollar average hourly bill rates 
international revenue from services represented of total company revenues in and in on a constant currency basis  revenue from services increased 
on an adjusted week constant currency basis  revenue from services in the international segment increased 
average hourly bill rates increased on a constant currency basis 
the year over year increase in average hourly bill rates  on a constant currency basis  is primarily due to stronger average hourly bill rates in the asia pacific region 
constant currency year over year revenue comparisons reflect increases of in the first quarter  in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
on an adjusted week constant currency basis  fourth quarter revenue from services increased 
the strong improvements realized in revenue were caused by both a general economic recovery in most countries  and kelly s particular focus on revenue growth 
fourth quarter and total year revenue growth was positive in all regions the americas  uk ireland  continental europe and asia pacific 
additionally  fee based income in the international segment experienced year over year growth of on a week basis 
international earnings totaled million for  compared to a loss of thousand for the increase in revenue from services was partially offset by a percentage point decrease in the gross profit rate and a increase in expenses  as measured in us dollars 
international results generally improved as the year progressed 
the segment recorded a loss of thousand in the first quarter  income of million in the second quarter  income of million in the third quarter and income of million in the fourth quarter 
the decrease in the international gross profit rate is due primarily to rate decreases in the united kingdom 
the decrease in gross profit rates experienced in the united kingdom is due  in large part  to a shift in customer mix to larger corporate account customers which tend to have lower gross margins 
many of the company s large corporate and national account customers have negotiated high volume global service agreements  which tend to result in lower gross profit rates than those earned with the company s small and medium size customers 
however  these accounts also have a lower administrative cost due to economies of scale  and can yield an operating margin similar to that realized with small or medium size customers 
the company s strategy is focused on serving and growing large national and local accounts 
as customer mix shifts to larger accounts  the company s average gross margins tend to decrease 
the increase in us dollar reported expenses is due primarily to increased salaries and incentive based compensation 
on a constant currency basis  expenses increased by 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were in  compared to in results of operations versus revenue from services for totaled billion  an increase of from this was the result of an increase in hours worked of and an increase in average hourly bill rates of 
revenue from services increased in each of the company s three business segments us commercial staffing  ptsa and international 
during  the us dollar declined in comparison to many foreign currencies  including the euro and british pound 
as a result  kelly s us dollar translated revenue from services was higher than would have otherwise been reported 
on a constant currency basis  revenue from services increased as compared with the table below summarizes the impact of foreign exchange adjustments on revenue from services for revenue from services change in millions of dollars us commercial staffing ptsa international constant currency revenue from services constant currency foreign currency impact revenue from services gross profit of million was higher than gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in  which decreased percentage point compared to the rate recorded in this reflected decreases in the gross profit rates of all three business segments 
the decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily due to higher workers compensation costs and  to the extent not recovered through pricing actions  higher payroll taxes 
during  primarily as a result of higher than expected medical inflation rates  the company revised its estimate of the cost of outstanding workers compensation claims and  accordingly  recorded additional expense of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million were higher than selling  general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues were in  a percentage point decrease compared to the rate in as measured on a constant currency basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased compared to higher marketing expenses and costs associated with the implementation of kelly staffnet  the company s new branch automation system  have been offset by lower incentive based compensation and retirement program costs 
in addition  expenses included additional costs related to the company s information technology programs and a loss related to the company s equity investment in itiliti  an internet based vendor management software provider 
net interest expense for was thousand  compared to net interest income of thousand in the change is primarily attributable to lower cash balances and lower interest rates earned on the cash balances 
earnings before taxes were million  a decrease of from earnings before taxes averaged of revenues in and of revenues in the effective income tax rate for was  a small increase from s rate of 
the net increase is attributable to valuation allowances established for certain international tax loss carryforwards  partially offset by the favorable settlement of prior years tax audits

year over year revenue comparisons were up in the first quarter  down in the second quarter  down in the third quarter and up in the fourth quarter 
year over year revenue growth strengthened month by month over the course of the fourth quarter 
us commercial staffing revenue from services represented of total company revenue from services for and for us commercial staffing earnings from operations totaled million for compared to earnings of million in  a decrease of 
the decrease in earnings from operations was primarily attributable to a percentage point decrease in the gross profit rate partially offset by the increase in revenue 
the decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily the result of higher workers compensation costs 
as noted above  the company revised its estimate of the cost of outstanding workers compensation claims and  accordingly  recorded additional expense in of the total million additional workers compensation expense  million was charged to us commercial staffing 
higher state unemployment taxes  to the extent not recovered through pricing actions and  to a lesser extent  shifts in customer and service line mix to lower gross profit business also reduced the segment gross profit rate 
many of the company s large corporate and national account customers have negotiated high volume global service agreements  which tend to result in lower gross profit rates than those earned with the company s small and medium size customers 
the company s strategy is focused on serving and growing these large corporate national accounts 
as customer mix shifts to large corporate and national accounts  the company s average gross margins tend to decrease 
the company has also experienced a shift in its mix of business from the office clerical to light industrial service lines 
because light industrial business typically generates lower gross profit rates than office clerical staffing  this mix shift has also tended to reduce the company s average gross profit rates 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by as compared to and  as a percentage of revenues  were for both and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to the impact of the company s ongoing deployment of new front office systems in part offset by lower field bonus costs and decreases in the cost of retirement programs 
professional  technical and staffing alternatives revenue from services in the ptsa segment for totaled million  an increase of compared to the million reported in this reflected a increase in average hourly bill rates  partially offset by a decrease in hours worked in the professional and technical businesses 
revenues in the staffing alternatives businesses  which include staff leasing  management services  hrfirst and vendor management services  increased by compared to ptsa revenues from services represented of total company revenues in both and results varied among the business units that comprise ptsa 
during  kelly financial resources  kelly law registry  kelly hrfirst  kelly management services and kelly vendor management all exhibited double digit sales growth as compared to kelly healthcare  kelly staff leasing  kelly information technology resources and kelly automotive services group also maintained positive revenue growth 
however  three large ptsa units  kelly scientific resources  kelly home care and kelly engineering resources  experienced revenue declines during as compared to these decreases  however  were consistent with industry trends in their staffing sectors 
ptsa earnings from operations for totaled million and increased from the same period in this was the result of the increase in revenue from services partially offset by a percentage point decrease in the gross profit rate and a increase in expenses 
the decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily the result of higher workers compensation costs 
ptsa was also impacted by higher workers compensation expense  primarily due to kelly staff leasing 
ptsa s share of the total million additional charge for workers compensation was million 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were for and for international translated us dollar revenue from services in the international segment for totaled billion  a increase compared to the billion reported for this resulted from an increase in hours worked of and a increase in the translated us dollar average hourly bill rates 
international revenue from services represented of total company revenues in and in on a constant currency basis  revenue from services increased and average hourly bill rates decreased 
the year over year decrease in average hourly bill rates  on a constant currency basis  is due primarily to a shift in mix of hours worked to countries such as mexico  russia and malaysia  which typically have lower average bill rates 
the strong improvements realized in revenue were caused by both a general economic recovery in most countries  and kelly s particular focus on sales growth 
fourth quarter sales growth was positive in all regions the americas  uk ireland  continental europe and asia pacific 
during the fourth quarter  consistent with the third quarter  revenue grew by in the americas as compared with however  unlike the third quarter where growth was primarily fueled by mexico  the fourth quarter saw stronger revenue growth in canada and puerto rico as well 
in our uk ireland operations  sales accelerated significantly during the second half of the year and revenues for the fourth quarter increased year over year 
the increase in revenue was primarily due to new staffing accounts added throughout the year 
in addition  our fee based recruiting businesses showed encouraging signs of improvement during the fourth quarter with year over year growth of 
we also saw encouraging year over year revenue growth in continental europe during the second half of the year 
revenue in continental europe turned positive in the third quarter and increased nearly in the fourth quarter 
the majority of the countries in which we operate  such as spain  russia  norway  luxembourg and holland  experienced solid revenue increases  while germany continued to post revenue declines 
although our temporary staffing business is recovering in continental europe  our fee based income continues to lag  as our recruiting business has been hit the hardest in this region 
the asia pacific growth was generated by our operations in australia  new zealand  singapore  and malaysia 
after experiencing strong revenue growth in the third quarter  revenue grew by year over year in the fourth quarter 
international reported a loss of thousand for  compared to earnings of million for the increase in revenue from services was more than offset by a percentage point decrease in the gross profit rate and a increase in expenses  as measured in us dollars 
international results continued to improve as the year progressed 
the segment recorded a loss of million in the first quarter  a loss of million in the second quarter  income of million in the third quarter and income of million in the fourth quarter 
the decrease in the international gross profit rate was due to rate decreases in the united kingdom and france  as well as the effect of lower fee based income on a constant currency basis 
the increase in us dollar reported expenses was due primarily to the effect of currency rates 
on a constant currency basis  expenses increased by

critical accounting estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in this process  it is necessary for management to make certain assumptions and related estimates affecting the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the attached notes 
actual results can differ from assumed and estimated amounts 
critical accounting estimates are those that management believes require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company considers the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and apply percentages to certain aged receivable categories 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and we monitor current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
historically  losses from uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our allowance 
since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance may be required 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger allowance was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
as of year end  and  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was million  million and million  respectively 
workers compensation the company has a combination of insurance and self insurance contracts under which the company effectively bears the first  of risk per single accident 
the company establishes accruals for workers compensation utilizing actuarial methods to estimate the undiscounted future cash payments that will be made to satisfy the claims  including an allowance for incurred but not reported claims 
this process includes establishing loss development factors  based on the historical claims experience of the company and the industry  and applying those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of the company s ultimate claims liability 
in preparing the estimates  we also consider the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as current legal  economic and regulatory factors 
management evaluates the accrual  and the underlying assumptions  regularly throughout the year and makes adjustments as needed 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accrual 
while management believes that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurances that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger accrual is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to cost of services in the period in which we made such a determination 
the accrual for workers compensation was million  million and million at year end  and  respectively 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its book value 
should circumstances change or events occur to indicate that the fair market value of the reporting unit has fallen below its book value  management must then compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to book value 
if the book value exceeds the estimated fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash charge to operating income 
we completed our impairment tests during the fourth quarter of the  and fiscal years and determined that goodwill is not impaired 
this test required comparison of our estimated fair value to our book value of goodwill 
the estimated fair value was based on a discounted cash flows analysis 
assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
different assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in an impairment charge  which would decrease operating income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
at year end  and  total goodwill amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
income taxes income tax expense is based on expected income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
judgment is required in determining our income tax expense 
we establish accruals when  despite our belief that reported taxable income is fully supportable  we believe that challenges are probable and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of accrual provisions and changes to accruals that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one time item 
tax laws require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the income tax expense reflected in our financial statements is different than the liability reported in our tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses which are not deductible on our tax return  and some are temporary differences  such as depreciation expense 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction on our tax return  but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an accrual  is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that our accruals reflect the probable outcome of tax contingencies 
favorable or unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would be recognized as an increase or decrease to our income tax expense in the year of resolution 
our tax accruals are presented in the balance sheet within income and other taxes

these statements are not guarantees of future performance  and the company has no specific intention to update these statements 
actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward looking statements due to a number of factors 
the principal important risk factors that could cause the company s actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  competitive market pressures including pricing  changing market and economic conditions  material changes in demand from large corporate customers  availability of temporary workers with appropriate skills required by customers  increases in wages paid to temporary workers  liabilities for client and employee actions  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in laws and regulations including federal  state and international tax laws  the company s ability to effectively implement and manage its information technology programs  and the ability of the company to successfully expand into new markets and service lines 
certain risk factors are discussed more fully under risk factors in part i  item of this filing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk kelly does not hold or invest in derivative contracts 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily due to its net investment in foreign subsidiaries  which conduct business in their local currencies 
these risks are mitigated by the use of the company s multi currency line of credit 
this credit facility is used to borrow in local currencies  which mitigates the exchange rate risk resulting from foreign currency denominated net investments fluctuating in relation to the us dollar 
in addition  the company is exposed to interest rate risks through its use of the multi currency line of credit 
the company is exposed to market risk as a result of its obligation to pay benefits under its nonqualified deferred compensation plan and its related investments in company owned variable universal life insurance policies 
the obligation to employees increases and decreases based on movements in the equity and debt markets 
the investments in publicly traded mutual funds  as part of the company owned variable universal life insurance policies  are designed to mitigate this risk with offsetting gains and losses 
overall  the company s holdings and positions in market risk sensitive instruments do not subject the company to material risk
