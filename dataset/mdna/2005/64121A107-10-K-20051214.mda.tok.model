item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop and manufacture server appliance solutions that deliver data storage and network security applications on server appliances 
server appliances are pre configured network infrastructure devices designed to optimally deliver specific software application functionality and facilitate ease of deployment and support of a software application in a customer s network 
we are organized into two reportable segments oem appliance and distribution 
oem appliance segment in our oem appliance segment  we develop and manufacture server appliance solutions that enable network equipment providers and independent software vendors  or isvs  to deliver their data storage and network security applications in the form of a server appliance 
we offer our server appliance partners a comprehensive suite of services  including development  manufacturing  fulfillment and post sale support 
we produce and fulfill devices branded for our network equipment and isv partners  and derive our revenues from the sale of value added hardware platforms to these partners 
these partners subsequently sell and support the device under their own brands to their customer base 
during the years ended september  and  sales to emc represented and  respectively  of our oem appliance segment revenues 
for the years ended september  and our oem appliance segment had segment operating income of million and million  respectively 
refer to footnote of our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report for purposes of determining segment operating income 
distribution segment currently in our distribution segment  we develop  manufacture  sell  market and support our ns series security appliances that are based on microsoft s internet security and acceleration isa server we license and integrate this software with server appliance platforms and our proprietary software to sell our own branded server appliances primarily to microsoft certified or network security value added resellers and system integrators 
however sales of these servers did not commence until fiscal year and  as a result  sales of these server appliances have represented a small portion of our distribution segment revenues 
in october  we began to sell our ns security appliance  and in february  we announced the introduction of the ns we expect that the sale of our ns series security appliances will be the primary source of our future distribution segment revenues 
however  sales of these appliances did not meet our expectations during fiscal and we believe that it may take several quarters more before revenues from sales of these server appliances become significant 
primarily as a result of these less than expected sales  in fiscal we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in our distribution segment of approximately million 
previously in our distribution segment we also distributed third party data storage networking connectivity products for the leading fibre channel host bus adapter  or hba  and storage switch manufacturers in the data storage industry to a customer base of value added resellers and systems integrators 
to date  substantially all of our distribution segment s revenue has been derived from the sale of third party data storage networking components and products  predominantly emc approved fibre channel hbas 
in december  we amended our distribution agreement with emc regarding our sales of emc approved fibre channel hbas 
this amendment was effective january  and required that we pay a royalty to emc for each emc approved fibre channel hba that we sell 
as a result of this amendment  there was a decline in our gross profits related to sales of emc approved fibre channel hbas  which in turn had a negative impact on our distribution segment gross profits as well as our consolidated gross profits and operating results 
in addition  as a result of the higher costs per emc approved fibre channel hba that this amendment imposed upon us  our distribution segment s ability to compete in large sales transactions involving emc approved fibre channel hbas was negatively affected 
this amendment  the commoditization of fibre channel hba technology  and the increasing competition in the market resulted in declining gross profits related to our distribution of hbas 
during the quarter ended december   we discontinued sales of these third party data storage networking products  as a result of these factors and the future prospects of this portion of our segment 
during the years ended september  and  sales of these third party data storage networking products represented and  respectively  of our distribution segment revenues 
for the years ended september  and our distribution segment had segment operating losses of million and million  respectively 
refer to footnote of our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report for purposes of determining segment operating loss 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made estimates and judgments in determining certain amounts included in the financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from products are generally recognized upon delivery to customers if persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
in the event we have unfulfilled future obligations  revenue and related costs are deferred until those future obligations are met 
we have an inventory consignment agreement with our largest customer related to certain server appliances sold through our oem appliance segment 
this customer notifies us when it utilizes inventory and we recognize revenues from sales to this customer based upon these notifications 
maintenance revenues are derived from customer support agreements generally entered into in connection with the initial server appliance sales and subsequent renewals 
maintenance fees are typically for one to three year renewable periods and include the right to unspecified software updates when and if available  hardware repairs  hour customer support  and advanced replacement of server appliances 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance and are included in deferred revenue 
contracts and or customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and consignment usage notifications are used to verify shipment or transfer of ownership  as applicable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
for revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements  such as the sale of both the product and post sales support  in which software is not incidental to the product  such as our sales of server appliances through our distribution segment  we determine fair value based upon vendor specific objective evidence  which is typically established through contractual post sales support renewal rates whereby the residual fair value is allocated to the server appliance 
for revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements  in which software is not included or is incidental to the product  such as our sales of server appliances through our oem appliance segment  we determine fair value based on objective and reliable evidence of fair value  which is typically determined through contractual refund rates for cancellations  and stand alone sales of post sales support  whereby the residual fair value is allocated to the server appliance 
we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria for each element of the sale is met 
if we are not able to derive the fair value of the undelivered element of the sale maintenance  all revenues from the arrangement are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the support arrangement  which is typically one to three years 
allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts 
we regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  or if other circumstances arise  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and additional allowances could be required  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
historically  our distribution segment customers were offered a thirty day right of return on un opened third party data storage networking products 
a reserve for sales returns was established based on historical trends in product return rates 
the reserve for sales returns was recorded as a reduction of our revenues and accounts receivable 
all rights of return related to sales of these products expired at december  inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or estimated market  and determine cost on a first in  first out basis 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a write down for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and anticipated production requirements in the near future 
any rapid technological changes and future product development could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
agreements with certain of our oem appliance customers include inventory protection provisions  however  these provisions may not provide us with complete protection from loss due to excess or obsolete inventory 
product warranty obligations we offer a warranty on certain of our products that generally provide for us to repair or replace any defective products for a period of up to months after shipment 
we reserve for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue and record warranty expense as a component of cost of sales 
oem server appliance products costs included in our server appliance product warranty obligation include shipping  materials  internal and external labor  and travel 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating our warranty reserve on our oem server appliance products 
although our current oem server appliance products use more standards based technologies than in the past  certain of our server appliance products incorporate proprietary technologies  which may increase our risks related to product warranty obligations 
in the past we have experienced unexpected component failures in certain of our server appliance products  which have required us to increase our product warranty accruals 
at the time any unexpected component failure arises  we assess the costs to repair any defects and record what we believe to be an appropriate warranty obligation based on the available information at the time 
to the extent we may experience increased warranty claim activity  increased costs associated with servicing those claims  or use estimates that prove to be materially different from actual claims  our product warranty obligations may need to be increased  resulting in decreased gross profits 
ns series security appliance products our ns series security appliances typically do not include a general warranty  but instead customers typically are required to purchase an annual maintenance program at the time of the appliance purchase 
our ns series security appliances sold in europe are sold with a thirteen month hardware warranty 
hba products our hba warranty expense was determined based upon contractual rates with a third party warranty provider who we paid to perform substantially all activities related to the fulfillment of our hba product warranty obligations 
as such  the warranty expense that we recognized for past shipments is fixed and is not subject to change 
goodwill and long lived assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we review long lived assets at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate impairment 
conditions that would trigger a more frequent impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in certain agreements  or business climate that could affect the value of an asset 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets based on the projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset s remaining life 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on the excess of the carrying value over fair value 
fair value is generally calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  which requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
goodwill is reviewed each year in the fourth quarter for impairment  or more frequently if certain indicators are present 
examples of such indicators that would cause us to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  or a loss of key personnel 
when conducting our impairment evaluation  we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit  as defined  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the carrying value of that reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of the goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess  if any 
fair value is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  and includes significant judgments by management 
we believe that the most significant judgments involved in the determination of the fair value of our goodwill is our expectation of future revenues and gross profits from our sales of server appliances through our distribution segment 
we have a limited history selling server appliances through our distribution segment 
income tax asset valuation we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimate of future taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
at september   we believe that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  and  accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit 
to the extent that net operating losses  when realized  relate to stock options deductions of approximately million  the resulting benefits will be credited to additional paid in capital 
comparability of financial information on december   we completed our acquisition of tidalwire 
as a result  the three months ended march  was the first quarter that included the tidalwire operations in our consolidated results for an entire quarter 
our financial results only include tidalwire financial results for periods subsequent to december  as such  the presentation of historical financial information and any discussion regarding the comparison of historical financial information does not include any financial information for tidalwire prior to december   unless otherwise indicated 
results of operations the following data summarizes the results of our operations for the past three fiscal years  in thousands and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended september  dollars of net revenues dollars of net revenues dollars of net revenues net revenues gross profit operating expenses a loss from operations net loss a includes approximately million related to an impairment charge for goodwill in  and million related to an impairment charge for intangible assets in discussion of fiscal and net revenues and gross profit loss the following table summarizes our net revenues and gross profit loss by reportable segment  in thousands and as a percentage of net revenues for year ended september  increase decrease dollars of net revenues dollars of net revenues dollars percentage oem appliance net revenues gross profit distribution net revenues gross profit loss total net revenues total gross profit net revenues our revenues are derived from sales of server appliances primarily to our oem network equipment and isv partners 
we also derived revenues from the distribution of third party data storage networking products  until we completed our exit from this portion of our distribution business during the quarter ended december  our oem appliance segment net revenues increased in fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to an increase in sales volumes to emc  which represented of oem appliance net revenues for the year ended september  versus for the year ended september  net revenues to other oem appliance partners for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  approximately million of this increase is the result of net revenue growth among pre existing oem appliance customers and approximately million of this increase is attributable to revenues from new oem appliance customers added in the past year 
our distribution segment net revenues during fiscal decreased significantly compared to net revenues in fiscal net revenues for fiscal were attributable to sales of third party data storage networking products  which we no longer sold subsequent to december  during the years ended september  and  sales of these third party data storage networking products represented and  respectively  of our distribution segment revenues 
we expect that in the future our distribution segment revenues will consist primarily of sales of our ns series security appliances 
our first ns series security appliance  the ns  became available in october and our ns was introduced during february we have not experienced significant sales from these server appliances during fiscal gross profit loss gross profit loss represents net revenues recognized less the cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes cost of materials  warranty costs  inventory obsolescence charges  shipping and handling costs  customer support costs  and manufacturing costs  which are primarily comprised of compensation  contract labor costs and  when applicable  contract manufacturing costs 
gross profit in our oem appliance segment increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of increased sales volumes 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in our oem appliance segment decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal this is due primarily to changes in product mix  which was partially offset by higher sales volumes 
the decrease in gross profits and gross profits as a percentage of net revenues in our distribution segment was attributable to our exit from distributing third party data storage networking products combined with lower than expected sales of our ns series security appliances during fiscal our gross profit is affected by the product mix within our oem appliance business  our oem appliance segment product pricing as well as the timing  size and configuration of server appliance orders 
oem appliance gross profit is also affected by the mix of product manufactured internally compared to product manufactured by our contract manufacturer  which carries higher manufacturing costs 
as volumes continue to increase for a given oem partner  we expect gross profits as a percentage of net revenues to decline due to higher discounting 
in addition  we expect gross profits to also decline in fiscal based on anticipated changes to the oem product mix and competitive pricing pressure 
because our ns series security appliances are still an emerging product  until sales volumes become significant  our gross profits in our distribution segment will not be contributory 
we expect gross profit to continue to be affected by these factors in both the oem appliance and distribution segments 
we expect that the gross margins as a percentage of revenue on our ns series security appliances will continue to be significantly influenced by promotional activities targeted at achieving market acceptance of these products 
operating expenses the most significant components of our operating expenses are research and development  selling and marketing  general and administrative expenses  and impairment of goodwill 
the following table presents operating expenses during the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of net revenues for year ended september  increase decrease of net of net dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars percentage operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative impairment of goodwill stock compensation restructuring and other charges credits impairment of intangible and long lived assets amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in research and development  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  material costs for prototype and test units and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancements of our server appliance products 
we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred 
the following table summarizes the most significant components of research and development expense for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total research and development expense and provides the changes in thousands and percentages for year ended september  increase decrease dollars of expense category dollars of expense category dollars percentage research and development compensation and related expenses prototype consulting and outside services other total research and development overall  our server appliance development expenses have increased as a result of an increase in software development activities related to our ns series security appliances and the development and sustained engineering efforts related to existing  new and prospective isv and network equipment partners 
to support these development activities  we have increased our research and development personnel from at september  to at september   which has resulted in increased compensation costs 
we have also increased the number of consultants used to supplement our research and development personnel levels  primarily in the area of software development  which has resulted in increased consulting and outside service costs 
conversely  our prototype expenses for fiscal decreased from fiscal as a result of the timing of certain engineering projects in our oem appliance segment 
our server appliance development strategy emphasizes the utilization of standard  off the shelf components in our server appliance platforms 
however  we expect that in some cases significant development efforts will be required to fulfill our current and potential isv and network equipment partners needs 
in addition  for our ns series security appliances  we intend to focus our software development in areas that improve the ease of server appliance implementation and use  which we believe will enhance our value proposition 
we expect that research and development costs will continue to increase in fiscal primarily due to certain development projects for both our oem appliance segment and ns series security appliances 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for personnel engaged in sales and marketing  costs associated with our marketing programs  which include costs associated with our attendance at trade shows  public relations  product literature costs  web site enhancements and product evaluation costs  consulting and outside services costs and travel 
the following table summarizes the most significant components of selling and marketing expense for the periods indicated in thousands and as a percentage of total selling and marketing expense and provides the changes in thousands and percentages for year ended september  increase decrease dollars of expense category dollars of expense category dollars percentage selling and marketing compensation and related expenses marketing programs consulting and outside services travel other total selling and marketing our distribution segment by its nature incurs more of the marketing and sales burden of the products that it sells and must engage in a higher level of marketing program activities than our oem appliance segment 
sales in our oem appliance segment are to our isv and network equipment partners who market and sell their products  which incorporate our server appliances 
as a result  our oem appliance segment engages in a limited level of marketing programs 
as indicated in the table above  the primary component of the increase in selling and marketing expenses are marketing program costs offset in part by a decrease in compensation costs 
we have increased the level of marketing programs during fiscal as a result of the release of our ns series security appliances 
our selling and marketing personnel decreased slightly  in the aggregate  from at september  to at september  this net decrease represents decreases from terminations and attrition related to our exit from the distribution of third party data storage networking products  partially offset by increased hiring throughout the year related to our ns series security appliances 
as a result  compensation and related expenses decreased in the aggregate during fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  our consulting and outside services and travel expenses have increased from fiscal as a result of our continued effort to build our channel of resellers and distributors for our ns series security appliances 
in particular we commenced our european sales operations during the quarter ended june   with our initial focus being in the united kingdom and southern europe 
we believe that we must continue our selling and marketing efforts in order to enhance our position as a leading provider of server appliance products and to establish ourselves as a leader in network security appliances 
variable marketing costs  such as marketing programs  are somewhat dependent on the timing and magnitude of new product introductions and will fluctuate depending on the level of this activity 
we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in fiscal as we continue invest in developing our channel of resellers and building brand awareness for our ns series security appliances 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for executive  finance  information technology and human resources personnel  professional services  which include legal  accounting  audit and tax fees  and costs of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  director and officer insurance  and bad debt expenses 
the following table summarizes the most significant components of general and administrative expense for the periods indicated in thousands and as a percentage of total general and administrative expense and provides the changes in thousands and percentages for year ended september  increase decrease dollars of expense category dollars of expense category dollars percentage general and administrative compensation and related expenses professional services director and officer insurance bad debt expense recoveries other total general and administrative as indicated in the table above  the primary component of the increase in general and administrative expenses is increased consulting and professional services 
the increase in consulting and professional services is due primarily to increased costs related to our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of we expect general and administrative expenses to remain consistent in fiscal  however this will be dependent on costs associated with ongoing litigation and the relative costs to operate as a public company 
impairment of goodwill we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal this assessment was performed using an appraisal based primarily on the estimated discounted cash flows expected to be generated by our distribution segment  which now consists only of our ns series security appliances 
the discounted cash flows used in the appraisal were based on a number of estimates and assumptions made by us  including the projected future operating results of our distribution segment  the discount rate  and the long term growth rate 
we based our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates  and actual fiscal results 
sales of our ns series security appliances did not meet our expectations during fiscal and we believe that it may take several more quarters before revenues from sales of these server appliances become significant 
these factors were significant contributors in determining key assumptions used in our appraisal 
in addition to these factors  we considered the continued expected investments in technology development and sales and marketing efforts 
our assessment resulted in an implied fair value of the distribution reporting unit s goodwill that was significantly lower than its carrying value of that goodwill 
consequently  we determined that our goodwill was fully impaired resulting in an impairment charge of  for the year ended september  stock compensation 
stock compensation relates to the issuance of stock options in prior years with exercise prices below the deemed fair value of the company s common stock on the date of issuance 
we amortized stock compensation over the vesting period of the related options  which is attributable for approximately  of stock compensation in fiscal the decrease in stock compensation in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to the completed amortization of the deferred stock compensation related to these options as scheduled 
in addition  approximately  of stock compensation in fiscal relates to stock options granted to a non employee 
prospectively we expect stock compensation to have a material impact on our results of operations from our adoption of statement of financial accounting standard  no 
r share based payment beginning in fiscal which requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in our financial statements 
restructuring and other charges 
during fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  related to our exit from that portion of the business related to the distribution of third party data storage networking products 
approximately  of the charge related to one time employee benefits associated with terminating certain employees in this portion of the business during the year 
we also incurred  for a fixed payment related to our warranty fulfillment contract with an external service provider 
during fiscal we reversed the remaining restructuring accrual balance of  which related to certain modifications we made to our leased facilities 
amortization and impairment of intangible and long lived assets 
in connection with our acquisition of tidalwire in december  we recorded a definite lived intangible asset attributable to tidalwire s existing customer relationships 
this asset was being amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
in december  we amended our agreement with emc regarding distribution of emc approved hbas 
this amendment required us to pay a royalty to emc for each emc approved hba we sold 
as a result of the negative effect of this amendment on our gross profits  we considered this amendment to be a triggering event requiring assessment for impairment 
as a result  during the quarter ended december  we conducted a detailed impairment analysis of our intangible assets 
this analysis resulted in the determination that the fair value of our intangible assets was less than its carrying amount  which resulted in a charge to operations of approximately  in the quarter ended december  we also performed an impairment evaluation of the remaining carrying value of these intangible assets at september  this analysis resulted in an additional impairment charge of  the effect of the total fiscal impairment charge of  reduced the remaining carrying value of these intangible assets to zero 
as a result of this elimination of the carrying value of the assets during fiscal  there was no amortization expense for fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also assessed the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by our distribution segment and determined that the carrying value of certain equipment attributable to our distribution segment was not recoverable as determined in accordance with sfas as a result  we recognized an impairment charge of  for the year ended september  approximately   of this impairment charge was recorded through cost of revenues 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net has increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
discussion of fiscal and net revenues and gross profit the following table summarizes our net revenues and gross profit by reportable segment  in thousands and as a percentage of net revenues for year ended september  increase decrease dollars of net revenues dollars of net revenues dollars percentage oem appliance net revenues gross profit distribution net revenues gross profit total net revenues total gross profit net revenues the increase in net revenues from fiscal to fiscal is due primarily to increased oem appliance sales to emc and increased distribution sales as a result of a full year of sales related to third party data storage networking products 
our oem appliance segment net revenues increased for fiscal primarily due to an increase in sales volumes to emc  which represented of oem appliance net revenues in the fiscal versus fiscal additionally  net revenues to oem appliance customers other than emc grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately million of the increase is the result of net revenue growth among pre existing oem appliance customers and approximately million of this increase is attributable to revenues from new oem appliance customers added in the past year 
sales of third party data storage networking products represented of our distribution segment net revenues for fiscal and the increase in net revenues in from was the result of an entire year of distribution sales in fiscal from our acquisition of tidalwire on december  compared to only nine months of sales in fiscal additionally  sales volumes of hbas were higher  which were offset in part by a decrease in the average sales prices 
gross profit the increase in gross profit in our oem appliance segment is due primarily to growth in our oem appliance sales volumes 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit in our oem appliance segment has declined due primarily to higher discounting to certain customers as a result of volume increases and due to higher inventory obsolescence write downs 
the decrease in our gross profit as a percentage of oem appliance net revenues was offset in part by lower manufacturing costs per unit sold due to volume efficiencies and related manufacturing process improvements and lower warranty costs 
the increase in our distribution segment gross profit is due primarily to the growth of distribution net revenues 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit in our distribution segment has declined primarily due to royalty costs incurred in as a result of our amended agreement with emc regarding our distribution of emc approved fibre channel hbas  which was effective january  to a lesser extent  the decreases in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of distribution segment net revenues are due to lower average selling prices as well as changes to the mix of products sold through our distribution segment

in particular  we incurred substantial development costs during the fourth quarter of relating to the development of a server appliance hardware platform for a future version emc s centera product 
to support these and other development activities related to our ns series security appliances we increased our research and development personnel from at september  to at september   which resulted in increased compensation costs 
we also increased the number of consultants used to supplement our research and development personnel levels  primarily in the area of software and to a lesser extent hardware development  which resulted in increased consulting and outside service costs 
selling and marketing 
the following table summarizes the most significant components of selling and marketing expense for the periods indicated in thousands and as a percentage of total selling and marketing expense and provides the changes in thousands and percentages for year ended september  increase decrease dollars of expense category dollars of expense category dollars percentage selling and marketing compensation and related expenses marketing programs consulting travel other total selling and marketing as indicated in the table above  the primary components of the increase in selling and marketing expenses are compensation and marketing program costs 
primarily as a result of our acquisition of tidalwire on december   our selling and marketing personnel increased from prior to this acquisition  to at september  the increases in compensation were primarily due to the effect of an entire fiscal year of expenses related to these personnel additions compared to approximately nine months in fiscal similarly  the increase in marketing program costs was due to the effect of an entire fiscal year of marketing program activities related to our distribution segment compared to a partial year in additionally  marketing program costs have increased related to activities related to our ns series security appliances 
general and administrative 
the following table summarizes the most significant components of general and administrative expense for the periods indicated in thousands and as a percentage of total general and administrative expense and provides the changes in thousands and percentages for year ended september  increase decrease dollars of expense category dollars of expense category dollars percentage general and administrative compensation and related expenses professional services director and officer insurance bad debt expense other total general and administrative as indicated in the table above  the primary components of the increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to were increased compensation and increased consulting and professional service costs 
at september  we had employees in our general and administrative department compared to employees at september  the increase in professional services was due primarily to an increase in legal and accounting costs related to certain non recurring projects  increased compliance costs and overall growth 
our director and officer insurance costs  which are related to premiums associated with insurance coverage that we provide on behalf of our directors and officers  increased from due to enhanced coverage 
stock compensation 
we recorded deferred stock compensation on our balance sheet of million in connection with stock option and restricted stock grants to our employees and directors that were granted between february  and june  this amount represents the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes at the date of grant 
we have amortized this stock compensation over the vesting period of the related options 
all options granted subsequent to june  have been issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock and  accordingly  no additional deferred compensation has been recorded 
through september   we amortized million to stock compensation expense and million of deferred stock compensation has been reversed due to the cancellation of options for terminated employees 
in connection with our acquisition of tidalwire  we assumed all of tidalwire s outstanding options  which converted into options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
we recorded approximately  of deferred stock compensation on our balance sheet related to unvested options 
this amount represents the difference between the exercise prices and the fair market value of our common stock on the option conversion date 
we amortized this deferred stock compensation over the remaining vesting period of the related options 
through september   we amortized  to stock compensation expense and  of deferred stock compensation has been reversed due to the cancellation of options for terminated employees 
restructuring and other charges 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge to operations of  this charge was comprised entirely of future lease and lease related payments and resulted from the continued vacancy of certain leased facilities and the expected future vacancy of certain leased facilities that were occupied by a sub tenant 
we determined the amount of this charge through an analysis of the real estate market in and around these facilities  the likelihood that these facilities could be sub leased during the remainder of the existing lease terms and the financial condition of the sub tenant 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we received  of sublease income not previously anticipated and  as a result  reversed  of this charge 
this charge was later revised resulting in a reversal of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal in may  our landlord authorized us to expand the production area of our leased facilities 
subsequently  our management approved and initiated a plan to utilize leased space that was previously unoccupied 
as a result  we reversed the remaining restructuring accrual balance of  during fiscal amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
in connection with our acquisition of tidalwire in december  we engaged a third party valuation firm to evaluate the intangible assets generated as a result of the acquisition 
as a result of this valuation work  we recorded approximately million of intangible assets attributable to tidalwire s existing customer relationships as of december  we estimated the useful life of the relationships to be five years and as such  we were amortizing the related intangible assets on a straight line basis over five years 
on december   we amended our agreement with emc regarding our distribution of emc approved fibre channel hbas  effective january  because of this amendment  we were required to pay a royalty for each emc approved fibre channel hba sold by us beginning in the quarter ended march  as a result  our gross profits from sales of emc approved fibre channel hbas were lower than originally expected 
because of the negative impact of this amendment on our operating results  we considered this amendment to be a triggering event requiring an impairment evaluation of our intangible assets 
as a result  we conducted a detailed analysis of our intangible assets as of december  this analysis resulted in the determination that the fair value of our intangible assets  which is primarily attributable to our distribution agreement with emc regarding emc approved fibre channel hbas  was less than its carrying amount  which resulted in a charge to operations of approximately million in the quarter ended december  as a result of this reduction in the carrying value of the asset  amortization expense decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal we also performed an impairment evaluation of the remaining carrying value of these intangible assets at september  this analysis resulted in the remaining carrying value exceeding the fair value and therefore an impairment charge to operations of  resulting in a total impairment charge to operations during the year ended september  of million 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes cash flow activities for the fiscal years ended in thousands september  net loss non cash adjustments to net loss changes in working capital cash used in provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year the following table presents our short term investments as of the year ended september in thousands september  short term investments operating activities cash flows used in operating activities of million for fiscal were attributable to a net loss of million offset by non cash adjustments to net loss of million and changes in working capital of million 
non cash adjustments to net loss consisted substantially of our goodwill impairment charge of million and depreciation expense of million 
significant cash flow effects from changes in working capital for fiscal included an increased cash flow of million from the collection of accounts receivable  million from a reduction of inventory  and  from increased deferred revenue 
these increases in cash flow were partially offset by decreased cash flow from a decrease in accounts payable of million 
the higher collections of accounts receivable  and the associated reduction in inventory and accounts payable are primarily the result of our exit from the distribution of third party storage networking products 
in the first quarter of fiscal we sold our remaining inventory related to this portion of our business  which has entirely been converted to cash as of september  our days sales outstanding was days in fiscal compared to days in our days sales outstanding could vary significantly due to possible fluctuations in the timing of shipments to and payments primarily from our large oem appliance customer 
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities during fiscal resulted from net purchases of million of short term available for sale investments combined with million of investments in property and equipment 
cash flows used in investing activities during fiscal were attributable to million of purchases for equipment offset by net sales of short term investments of million 
financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities consisted of cash received as a result of employee stock option and stock purchase plan activity of  in fiscal cash flows provided by financing activities of million for fiscal were primarily related to stock option and stock purchase plan activity  combined with the receipt of certain legal settlement proceeds of approximately  we expect employee stock option activity to continue in fiscal  however we cannot predict its level given the volatility of our stock price 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make certain payments in thousands 
payments due by period less than year years years after years total operating leases capital lease obligation purchase obligations total our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing and size of orders from our largest customer  the level of investment required for development and sales and marketing related to our ns series security appliances  our ability to enter into partnerships with value added resellers and system integrators and their ability to sell our ns series security appliances  our ability to market and sell our ns series security appliances  our ability to form an adequate number of oem partnerships with network equipment providers and isvs  the level of success of our oem appliance partners in selling server appliance solutions that include our server appliance hardware platforms  the costs and timing of product engineering efforts and the success of these efforts  the outcome of pending litigation  and market developments 
we believe that our available cash resources  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and cash that we expect to generate from sales of our products will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds 
we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through borrowings  public or private equity financings or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
if additional financing is needed and is not available on acceptable terms  we may need to reduce our operating expenses

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is a revision of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides the staff s views regarding interactions between fas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
in april  the sec adopted a new rule amending the compliance dates for sfas r 
in accordance with the new rule  the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for us in our fiscal year beginning october  we will adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method  which is a method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
we expect to apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a straight line basis 
we expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net loss per share 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of sfas are effective for the fiscal year beginning october  our early adoption of the provisions of sfas in the year ended september   did not affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging transactions and therefore  do not believe we are subject to material exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we invest excess cash balances in cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows will not be material
