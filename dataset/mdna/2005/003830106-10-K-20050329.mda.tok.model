item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations prior to february  grey wolf exploration inc was a wholly owned canadian subsidiary of abraxas 
in february  grey wolf  closed on an initial public offering resulting in the substantial divestiture of our capital stock in grey wolf 
as a result of the grey wolf ipo  and the significant divestiture of our interest in grey wolf  the results of operations of grey wolf are reflected in our financial statements and in this document as discontinued operations and our remaining operations are referred to in our financial statements and in this document as continuing operations or continued operations 
unless otherwise noted  all disclosures are for continuing operations 
the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition  results of continuing operations  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
see financial statements in item general we are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the development  and production of natural gas and crude oil 
historically we have grown through the acquisition and subsequent development and exploitation of producing properties  principally through the redevelopment of old fields utilizing new technologies such as modern log analysis and reservoir modeling techniques as well as d seismic surveys and horizontal drilling 
as a result of these activities  we believe that we have a substantial inventory of low risk development opportunities  which provide a basis for significant production and reserve increases 
in addition  we intend to expand upon our exploitation and development activities with complementary low risk exploration projects in our core areas of operation 
we have incurred net losses in two of the last five years  and there can be no assurance that operating income and net earnings will be achieved in future periods 
our financial results depend upon many factors which significantly affect our results of operations including the following o the sales prices of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil  o the level of total sales volumes of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil  o the availability of  and our ability to raise additional capital resources and provide liquidity to meet cash flow needs  o the level of and interest rates on borrowings  and o the level and success of exploitation and development activity 
commodity prices and hedging activities 
our results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices 
price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years 
in january  the market price of natural gas was at its highest level in our operating history and the price of crude oil was also at a high level 
however  over the course of and the beginning of the first quarter of  prices again became depressed  primarily due to the economic downturn 
beginning in march  commodity prices began to increase and continued higher through december prices remained strong during and have continued to remain strong during the beginning of the table below illustrates how natural gas prices fluctuated during and the table below contains the last three day average of nymex traded contracts price and the prices we realized during each quarter for and  including the impact of our hedging activities

we seek to reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through swaps  options and other commodity derivative instruments 
in and  we experienced hedging losses of million and  respectively 
for the year ended december  we recognized a gain from hedging activities of approximately  under the terms of our new revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain hedging positions with respect to not less than nor more than of our natural gas and crude oil production  on an equivalent basis  for a rolling six month period 
as of december   we had the following hedges in place time period notional quantities price january  mmbtu of production per day floor of bbls of crude oil production per day floor of  mmbtu of production per day floor of february bbls of crude oil production per day floor of  mmbtu of production per day floor of march bbls of crude oil production per day floor of  mmbtu of production per day floor of april bbls of crude oil production per day floor of may december  mmbtu of production per day floor of production volumes 
because our proved reserves will decline as natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil are produced  unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploitation and development activities  our reserves and production will decrease 
our ability to acquire or find additional reserves in the near future will be dependent  in part  upon the amount of available funds for acquisition  exploitation and development projects 
we had capital expenditures for of million and anticipate approximately million  in  which we expect will include the drilling or recompletion of approximately wells 
capital spending limitations that existed under the terms of our prior senior credit agreement and our notes due were removed in connection with the refinancing that closed in october as a result of the limitations  we were limited for most of in our ability to replace existing production with new production 
if crude oil and natural gas prices return to depressed levels or if our production levels continue to decrease  our revenues  cash flow from operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
availability of capital 
as described more fully under liquidity and capital resources below  our sources of capital going forward will primarily be cash from operating activities  funding under its new revolving credit facility  cash on hand  and if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  proceeds from the sale of properties 
we currently have approximately million of availability under our new revolving credit facility 
exploitation and development activity 
we believe that our high quality asset base  high degree of operational control and large inventory of drilling projects position us for future growth 
our properties are concentrated in locations that facilitate substantial economies of scale in drilling and production operations and more efficient reservoir management practices 
we operate of the properties accounting for approximately of our pv  giving us substantial control over the timing and incurrence of operating and capital expenditures 
in addition  we have proved undeveloped locations and have identified over drilling and recompletion opportunities on our existing acreage  the successful development of which we believe could significantly increase our daily production and proved reserves 
our future natural gas and crude oil production  and therefore our success  is highly dependent upon our ability to find  acquire and develop additional reserves that are profitable to produce 
the rate of production from our natural gas and crude oil properties and our proved reserves will decline as our reserves are produced unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves  conduct successful development and exploitation activities or  through engineering studies  identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
we cannot assure you that our exploitation and development activities will result in increases in our proved reserves 
in addition  approximately of our total estimated proved reserves at december  were undeveloped 
by their nature  estimates of undeveloped reserves are less certain 
recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
for a more complete discussion of these risks please see risk factors we may be unable to acquire or develop additional reserves  in which case our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
borrowings and interest 
we currently have indebtedness of approximately million and availability of million under the new revolving credit facility 
we paid interest under our secured notes due by the issuance of additional notes  which caused our cash interest expense to be million during and million during in connection with the refinancing transactions completed in october  interest on the new notes will be paid in cash 
this increase in cash interest expense will require us to increase our production and cash flow from operations in order to meet our debt service requirements  as well as to fund the development of our numerous drilling opportunities 
outlook for as a result of final financial results and current market conditions  we have updated our operating and financial guidance for year as follows production bcfe approximately gas exit rate mmcfe d price differentials pre hedge per bbl per mcf lifting costs  per mcfe g a  per mcfe capital expenditures millions results of operations selected operating data 
the following table sets forth certain of our operating data for the periods presented

comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales increased by million from million in to million in the increase in revenue was primarily due to increased commodity prices realized in as compared to the increase in revenue due to commodity prices was partially offset by decreased production volumes 
higher commodity prices contributed million to natural gas and crude oil revenue while reduced production volumes had a million negative impact on revenue 
natural gas liquids volumes declined from mbbls in to mbbls in crude oil sales volumes increased slightly from mbbls in to mbbls during the increase is primarily due to the production from new wells in wyoming and west texas brought onto production in  offsetting natural field declines in other areas 
natural gas sales volumes decreased from bcf in to bcf in this decrease is primarily due to natural field declines 
there were no significant wells brought on line in  primarily due to significant restrictions on capital expenditures for most of the year 
average sales prices in net of hedging costs were o per bbl of crude oil  o per bbl of natural gas liquids  and o per mcf of natural gas 
average sales prices in net of hedging costs were o per bbl of crude oil  o per bbl of natural gas liquids  and o per mcf of natural gas 
lease operating expense 
lease operating expense  or loe  increased slightly from million in to million in the increase in loe was primarily due to higher production taxes associated with higher commodity prices in as compared to our loe on a per mcfe basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to for  primarily due to the decrease in production volumes 
g a expense 
g a expense increased from million in to million in the increase in g a expense was primarily due to performance bonuses in our g a expense on a per mcfe basis increased from in to in the increase in the per mcfe cost was due to increased expense and to lower production volumes in as compared to stock based compensation expense 
effective july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of accounting principles board opinion no

in march  we amended the exercise price to on all options with an existing exercise price greater than 
in january  we amended the exercise price to per share on certain options with an existing exercise price greater than per share which resulted in variable accounting 
we charged approximately million to stock based compensation expense in related to these repricings  compared to million during the increase is due to the increase in the price of our common stock in dd a expense

interest expense increased from million to million for compared to the increase in interest expense was due to increased debt levels in  prior to the refinancing completed in october the increase in debt was primarily due to the payment of interest by the issuance of new notes related to the notes due financing cost 
financing cost in was million compared to million in financing cost represent costs related to refinancing activities  which do not qualify for amortization over the life of the debt 
financing costs in were related to the restructuring transaction  which occurred in january the costs relate to the refinancing activities during income from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was million in compared to million in this represents income from our canadian subsidiary  which was sold in february income in included a gain on the sale of foreign subsidiaries in january of million 
excluding this gain  income in would have been million 
the increase in income in  exclusive of the gain  was due to increased production and higher commodity prices in as compared to comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales increased by million from million in to million in the increase in revenue was primarily due to increased commodity prices realized during the increase in natural gas and crude oil revenue resulting from increased prices was somewhat offset by decreased production volumes 
higher commodity prices contributed million to natural gas and crude oil revenue while reduced production volumes had a million negative impact on revenue 
natural gas liquids volumes increased from mbbls in to mbbls in crude oil sales volumes declined from mbbls in to mbbls during crude oil production decreased due primarily to natural field declines 
natural gas sales volumes decreased from bcf in to bcf in this decrease in production volumes was primarily due to natural field declines and property sales in limited drilling activity in and due to capital expenditure limitations also contributed to the decline in production volumes 
average sales prices in net of hedging costs were o per bbl of crude oil  o per bbl of natural gas liquids  and o per mcf of natural gas 
average sales prices in net of hedging costs were o per bbl of crude oil  o per bbl of natural gas liquids  and o per mcf of natural gas

in january  we amended the exercise price to per share on certain options with an existing exercise price greater than per share which resulted in variable accounting 
we charged approximately million to stock based compensation expense in related to these repricings 
during  we did not recognize any stock based compensation due to the decline in the price of our common stock 
dd a expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense decreased by million from million in to million in the decrease in dd a was primarily due to the ceiling limitation write downs in the second quarter of  and decreased production volumes during our dd a expense on a per mcfe basis for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in interest expense 
interest expense decreased from million to million for compared to the decrease in interest expense was due to the reduction in debt in total debt was reduced as a result of the transactions which occurred on january  total debt was million as of december  compared to million at december  income from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was million in compared to a loss of million in this represents income from our canadian subsidiary  which was sold in february the loss in was primarily due to a ceiling limitation writedown in that year of approximately million offset by a deferred tax benefit of million 
the income in was primarily due to a gain on the sale of canadian subsidiaries in january of million 
ceiling limitation write down 
we record the carrying value of our natural gas and crude oil properties using the full cost method of accounting 
for more information on the full cost method of accounting  you should read the description under critical accounting policies full cost method of accounting for natural gas and crude oil activities 
at june   our net capitalized costs of natural gas and crude oil properties exceeded the present value of our estimated proved reserves by million 
these amounts were calculated considering june  prices of per bbl for crude oil and per mcf for natural gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for each of the full cost pools 
at december  and our net capitalized cost of natural gas and crude oil properties did not exceed the present value of our estimated reserves  plus the cost of properties not being amortized and the lower of cost of fair value of unproved properties being included in cost being amortized  less related income taxes  due to increased commodity prices  as such  no write down was recorded in or we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional ceiling limitation write downs in the future 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and crude oil assets increases when natural gas and crude oil prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers or governmental action cause an abrogation of  or if we voluntarily cancel  long term contracts for our natural gas 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional write downs in the future 
if commodity prices decline or if any of our proved reserves are revised downward  a further write down of the carrying value of our natural gas and crude oil properties may be required 
liquidity and capital resources general 
the natural gas and crude oil industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business 
our capital requirements are driven principally by our obligations to service debt and to fund the following costs o the development of existing properties  including drilling and completion costs of wells  o acquisition of interests in additional natural gas and crude oil properties  and o production and transportation facilities 
the amount of capital expenditures we are able to make has a direct impact on our ability to increase cash flow from operations and  thereby  will directly affect our ability to service our debt obligations and to continue to grow the business through the development of existing properties and the acquisition of new properties 
our sources of capital going forward will primarily be cash from operating activities  funding under our new revolving credit facility  cash on hand  and if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  proceeds from the sale of properties 
however  under the terms of the notes  proceeds of optional sales of our assets that are not timely reinvested in new natural gas and crude oil assets will be required to be used to reduce indebtedness and proceeds of mandatory sales must be used to repay or redeem indebtedness 
working capital deficit 
the following discussion represents working capital from continuing operations 
at december  our current liabilities of approximately million exceeded our current assets of million resulting in a working capital deficit of million 
this compares to a working capital deficit of million as of december  current liabilities as of december  consisted of trade payables of million  revenues due third parties million  accrued interest of million and other accrued liabilities of million 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures related to our continuing operations in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the table below sets forth the components of these capital expenditures for the three years ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands expenditure category development    facilities and other total    during  and  capital expenditures were primarily for the development of existing properties 
we anticipate making capital expenditures for of approximately million  which we expect will include development activities related to approximately projects 
our capital expenditures could also include expenditures for acquisition of producing properties if such opportunities arise  but we currently have no agreements  arrangements or undertakings regarding any material acquisitions 
we have no material long term capital commitments and are consequently able to adjust the level of our expenditures as circumstances dictate 
additionally  the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on market conditions and other related economic factors 
should the prices of natural gas and crude oil decline from current levels  our cash flows will decrease which may result in a reduction of the capital expenditures budget 
if we decrease our capital expenditures budget  we may not be able to offset natural gas and crude oil production volumes decreases caused by natural field declines and sales of producing properties  if any 
sources of capital 
the net funds provided by and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities  related to continuing operations  are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities    net cash used in financing activities    total    operating activities for the year ended december  provided us with million of cash 
expenditures in of approximately were primarily for the development of natural gas and crude oil properties 
financing activities used million during  primarily for payments on long term debt and deferred financing fees 
operating activities for the year ended december  provided us with million of cash 
investing activities used million during financing activities used million during most of these funds were used to reduce our long term debt and were generated by the sale of our canadian subsidiaries and the exchange offer completed in january the sale of our canadian subsidiaries contributed million in reduced by million in exploitation and development expenditures 
expenditures in were primarily for the development of natural gas and crude oil properties 
operating activities for the year ended december  provided us million of cash 
investing activities provided million during our investing activities included the sale of properties which provided million  and the use of million primarily for the development of producing properties 
financing activities used million during  relating primarily to payments on long term debt 
future capital resources 
we currently have four principal sources of liquidity going forward i cash from operating activities  ii funding under our new revolving credit facility  iii cash on hand  and iv if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  the sale of producing properties 
while we are no longer subject to the million limitation on capital expenditures under our secured notes due  covenants under the indenture for the new notes and the new revolving credit facility restrict our use of cash from operating activities  cash on hand and any proceeds from asset sales 
under the terms of the notes  proceeds of optional sales of our assets that are not timely reinvested in new natural gas and crude oil assets will be required to be used to reduce indebtedness and proceeds of mandatory sales must be used to redeem indebtedness 
the terms of the notes and the new revolving credit facility also substantially restrict our ability to o incur additional indebtedness  o grant liens  o pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  o merge or consolidate with any other person  or o sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
our cash flow from operations depends heavily on the prevailing prices of natural gas and crude oil and our production volumes of natural gas and crude oil 
significant downturns in commodity prices  such as that experienced in the last nine months of and the first quarter of  can reduce our cash flow from operating activities 
although we have hedged a portion of our natural gas and crude oil production and will continue this practice as required pursuant to the new revolving credit facility  future natural gas and crude oil price declines would have a material adverse effect on our overall results  and therefore  our liquidity 
low natural gas and crude oil prices could also negatively affect our ability to raise capital on terms favorable to us 
our cash flow from operations will also depend upon the volume of natural gas and crude oil that we produce 
unless we otherwise expand reserves  our production volumes will decline as reserves are produced 
due to sales of properties in and january  and restrictions on capital expenditures under the terms of our old notes  we now have significantly reduced reserves and production as compared with pre levels 
in the future  if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  we may sell additional properties  which could further reduce our production volumes 
to offset the loss in production volumes resulting from natural field declines and sales of producing properties  we must conduct successful  exploitation and development activities  acquire additional producing properties or identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
while we have had some success in primarily pursuing these activities since january   we have not been able to fully replace the production volumes lost from natural field declines and property sales 
we believe our numerous drilling opportunities will allow us to increase our production volumes  however  our drilling activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or crude oil reservoirs will be found 
the risk of not finding commercially productive reservoirs will be compounded by the fact that of our total estimated proved reserves at december  were undeveloped 
if the volume of natural gas and crude oil we produce decreases  our cash flow from operations will decrease 
our total indebtedness and cash interest expense as a result of issuing the new notes and entering into the new revolving credit facility require us to increase our production and cash flow from operations in order to meet our debt service requirements  as well as to fund the development of our numerous drilling opportunities 
the ability to satisfy these new obligations will depend upon our drilling success as well as prevailing commodity prices 
contractual obligations 
we are committed to making cash payments in the future on the following types of agreements o long term debt o operating leases for office facilities we have no off balance sheet debt or unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  contractual obligations payments due in dollars in thousands total less than more than one year years years years long term debt    operating leases these amounts represent the balances outstanding under floating rate senior secured notes due and the new credit facility 
these repayments assume that interest will be will be paid on an as due and that we will not draw down additional funds thereunder 
these amounts represent office lease obligations  expiring in contingencies 
in  abraxas and a limited partnership  of which wamsutter holdings  inc is the general partner the partnership  were named in a lawsuit filed in us district court in the district of wyoming 
the claim asserted breach of contract  fraud and negligent misrepresentation by abraxas and the partnership related to the responsibility for year ad valorem taxes on natural gas and crude oil properties sold by abraxas and the partnership 
in february  a summary judgment was granted to the plaintiff in this matter and a final judgment in the amount of million was entered 
abraxas and the partnership appealed the district court s judgment and on november   the us court of appeals for the th circuit affirmed the district court s decision 
on december   the us court of appeals for the th circuit entered a mandate for the district court to enforce the judgment 
as of december   the final judgment amount was approximately million which includes accrued and unpaid interest since february 
abraxas has decided not to pursue further appeals and has paid its portion of the final judgment  approximately million  for which abraxas had previously established a reserve 
other obligations 
we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploitation development and production of crude oil and natural gas 
in the past  we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations  sales of properties  sales of production payments and borrowings under our bank credit facilities and other sources 
given our high degree of operating control  the timing and incurrence of operating and capital expenditures is largely within our discretion 
long term indebtedness 
the financial restructuring completed in october resulted in the redemption of our secured notes due and terminating our previous senior credit facility with the proceeds from o the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior secured notes due  o the proceeds from our million bridge loan  and o the payment to us by grey wolf of million from the proceeds of grey wolf s million term loan 
in connection with the grey wolf ipo completed in february  net proceeds of approximately million from the offering by grey wolf of treasury shares were used to repay grey wolf s term loan in its entirety and eliminate its working capital deficit 
net proceeds of approximately million from the secondary shares offered by abraxas were used to reduce the amount outstanding under its bridge loan to approximately million 
on march   the company was advised of the underwriter s intent to exercise million of the over allotment shares 
closing for this exercise is scheduled for march  and will provide approximately million that abraxas will utilize to payoff the remaining balance of its bridge loan

hedging activities our results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and we seek to reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through swaps  options and other commodity derivative instruments 
under our new revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain hedge positions on not less than or more than of our projected oil and gas production for a six month rolling period 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging sensitivity for further information 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had  subject to the limitation discussed below  million of net operating loss carryforwards for us tax purposes 
these loss carryforwards will expire through if not utilized 
uncertainties exist as to the future utilization of the operating loss carryforwards under the criteria set forth under fasb statement no 
therefore  we have established a valuation allowance of million and million for deferred tax assets at december  and  respectively 
related party transactions accounts receivable other in the consolidated balance sheets includes approximately  and as of december  and  respectively  representing amounts due from officers relating to advances made to employees 
abraxas has adopted a policy that transactions between abraxas and its officers  directors  principal stockholders  or affiliates of any of them  will be on terms no less favorable to abraxas than can be obtained on an arm s length basis in transactions with third parties and must be approved by the vote of at least a majority of the disinterested directors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
full cost method of accounting for natural gas and crude oil activities 
sec regulation s x defines the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in natural gas and crude oil activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we have chosen to follow the full cost method under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploitation and development are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploitation and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of natural gas and crude oil properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of natural gas and crude oil properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rate on our natural gas and crude oil properties 
at the time it was adopted  management believed that the full cost method would be preferable  as earnings tend to be less volatile than under the successful efforts method 
however  the full cost method makes us susceptible to significant non cash charges during times of volatile commodity prices because the full cost pool may be impaired when prices are low 
these charges are not recoverable when prices return to higher levels 
we have experienced this situation several times over the years  most recently in our natural gas and crude oil reserves have a relatively long life 
however  temporary drops in commodity prices can have a material impact on our business including impact from the full cost method of accounting 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of natural gas and crude oil properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties and the cost of properties not being amortized  less income taxes 
if net capitalized costs of natural gas and crude oil properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our stockholders equity and reported earnings 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of natural gas and crude oil properties increases when natural gas and crude oil prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers cancel long term contracts for our natural gas production 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher natural gas and crude oil prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
for the year ended december   we recorded a write down of approximately million related to continuing operations 
the write down in was due to low commodity prices 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional write downs in the future 
estimates of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves 
estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of o the quality and quantity of available data  o the interpretation of that data  o the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  o and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this report was based on evaluations prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
the estimates of proved reserves materially impact dd a expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
asset retirement obligations the estimated costs of restoration and removal of facilities are accrued 
the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
for all periods presented  we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in our full cost amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense 
hedge accounting 
from time to time  we use commodity price hedges to limit our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices 
results of those hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and crude oil sales 
statement of financial accounting standards  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was effective for us on january  sfas  as amended and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
in we elected out of hedge accounting as prescribed by sfas accordingly all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 
changes in fair value of contracts are recognized in earnings in the current period 
due to the volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  our financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december  and the net market value of our derivatives was an asset of  and  respectively 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 entitled inventory costs an amendment of arb  chapter 
the purpose of this statement is to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facilities expense  freight  handling cost and wasted material 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we are evaluating the effect of this statement on our operations and do not expect it to impact our financial statements 
in december the fasb issued summary of statement no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the proposed statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
as proposed  this statement is be effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  we are currently evaluating what effect this statement will have on our financial position or results of operations 
in december the fasb issued fasb no 
 entitled exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of abp opinion no 

the guidance in abp opinion no 
is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the statement is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not anticipate this statement impacting our financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 

sab no 
applies to companies using the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties and equipment costs 
sab no 
affects the way in which companies calculate their full cost ceiling limitation including asset retirement cost related to proved developed properties in the calculation of the ceiling and the way companies calculate depletion on oil and gas properties only asset retirement cost for new recompletions and new wells will be included in future development costs in calculating depletion rates 
the company does not anticipate that adoption of sab no will have a significant inpact on its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk as an independent natural gas and crude oil producer  our revenue  cash flow from operations  other income and equity earnings and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
declines in commodity prices will materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control  such as global political and economic conditions 
historically  prices received for natural gas and crude oil production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
most of our production is sold at market prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
assuming the production levels we attained during the year ended december   a decline in crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices would have reduced our operating revenue and cash flow by approximately million for the year 
hedging sensitivity on january   we adopted sfas as amended by sfas and sfas under sfas  all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
in we elected not to designate derivative instruments as hedges 
accordingly the instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the market value of the derivatives being recorded in current oil and gas revenue 
under the terms of our new revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain hedging positions with respect to not less than nor more than of our natural gas and crude oil production for a rolling six month period 
all hedge transactions are subject to our risk management policy  which has been approved by the board of directors 
as of december   we had the following hedges in place time period notional quantities price january  mmbtu of production per day floor of bbls of crude oil production per day floor of february  mmbtu of production per day floor of bbls of crude oil production per day floor of march  mmbtu of production per day floor of bbls of crude oil production per day floor of april  mmbtu of production per day floor of bbls of crude oil production per day floor of may december  mmbtu of production per day floor of interest rate risk at december   as a result of the financial restructuring that occurred in october  we had million in outstanding indebtedness under the floating rate senior secured notes due the notes bear interest at a per annum rate of six month libor plus 
the rate is redetermined on june and december of each year  beginning june  the current rate on the new notes is 
for every percentage point that the libor rate rises  our interest expense would increase by approximately million on an annual basis 
at december  we had million of outstanding indebtedness under our new revolving credit facility 
interest on this facility accrues at the prime rate announced by wells fargo bank plus 
for every percentage point increase in the announced prime rate  our interest expense would increase by approximately  on an annual basis
