generally  these types of adjustments are only permitted if current rents are below the hud published fair market rent fmr threshold 
if current rents exceed fmrs  a rent comparability study must be completed to demonstrate that the property s rents are below market 
contract renewal request forms must be submitted by the company to hud or its corresponding contract agent not less than days prior to the applicable hap anniversary date in order to renew an existing hap contract

inflation

sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires management to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred 
in performing this analysis  the company estimates holding periods of the assets  changes in fair market value of the assets and cash flows related to the operations of the assets to determine the range of potential alternatives and assigns a probability of the various alternatives under consideration by management 
should the estimates used to determine alternatives or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  an impairment may result which could materially impact the results of operations of the company 
the company did not record an impairment loss related to the carrying value of its long lived assets during any of the years ended december   or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires management to review goodwill annually and when an event of impairment has occurred

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas which superceded the october issuance 
this statement also supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this statement established standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
it does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in statement as originally issued 
this statement is effective july  for the company 
the company is required to apply the provisions of this statement using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas as originally issued 
these grant date fair values had been included in the pro forma disclosures in the notes to the financial statements for periods prior to the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost will be recognized on all awards granted on or after the effective date over the related service period 
for periods prior to july   the company may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for periods prior to the effective date are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures previously required for those periods 
modified retrospective application may be applied either a to all prior years for which sfas was effective or b only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption 
the company expects that  upon adoption  it will not elect to adjust its financial statements for periods prior to the effective date 
as a result of the adoption of this statement  the company expects to recognize compensation expense of approximately  for the year ended december  related to awards that have been granted on or before july  awards granted after january   if any  would result in additional compensation cost during the year ended december  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the company had million of variable rate mortgage debt 
additionally  the company has interest rate risk associated with fixed rate debt at maturity 
management has and will continue to manage interest rate risk as follows i maintain a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  ii consider hedges for certain long term variable and or fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps or interest rate caps  and iii use treasury locks where appropriate to hedge rates on anticipated debt transactions 
management uses various financial models and advisors to assist them in analyzing opportunities to achieve those objectives 
from time to time  the company may enter into hedge agreements to minimize its exposure to interest rate risks 
in april and may  the company completed two interest rate swaps 
the notional amounts of the swaps were approximately million 
these swaps were executed to hedge the fair market value of certain fixed rate loans 
on june   in conjunction with the maturing of the loan  the company terminated one of these swaps that had a notional amount of million 
the remaining swap terminates at the maturity of the related loan in october for the year ended december   the company recognized a reduction to interest expense of  with respect to these two swaps 
the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
december  december  in thousands fair market fair market long term debt thereafter total value total value fixed fixed rate mortgage debt      weighted average interest rate variable variable rate mortgage debt     weighted average interest rate libor based credit facilities      total variable rate debt      total long term debt       one libor based credit facility matures july  and the second libor based credit facility matures december  at december   there were million in borrowings outstanding on one of the facilities 
sensitivity analysis 
at december  and  the company estimates that a basis point decrease in market interest rates would have changed the fair value of fixed rate debt to a liability of million and million  respectively 
since of the company s mortgage debt is at fixed rates  a change in rates would have a minimal effect on the company s interest expense 
the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the company s fixed rate debt was determined with a valuation model based upon changes that measure the net present value of such obligation which arise from the hypothetical estimate as discussed above 
contingencies environmental 
there are no recorded amounts resulting from environmental liabilities and there are no known material contingencies with respect thereto 
future claims for environmental liabilities are not measurable given the uncertainties surrounding whether there exists a basis for any such claims to be asserted and  if so  whether any claims will  in fact  be asserted 
furthermore  no condition is known to exist that would give rise to a material liability for site restoration  post closure and monitoring commitments  or other costs that may be incurred with respect to the sale or disposal of a property 
phase i environmental audits were obtained at the time of the ipo  property acquisition  or property refinancing  as the case may be  on all of the company s wholly owned and joint venture properties
