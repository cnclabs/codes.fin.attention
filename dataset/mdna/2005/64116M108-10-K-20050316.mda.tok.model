item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary we are a leading provider of internet audience measurement and analysis in the united states and around the world 
all of our products and services are designed to assist companies in making critical business decisions regarding their internet strategies and initiatives 
we have a highly diversified and global client base  including large and small companies in the media  technology  advertising  financial services  consumer products  retail and travel industries 
vnu nv  through its subsidiaries acnielsen corporation and nielsen media research  currently owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
our revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
as of december   we had  clients  compared to  clients as of december  and clients as of december  the increases in our revenues and number of clients during the last few years is the result of both acquisitions that we have completed as well as organic growth in our product portfolio 
we expect our revenues and client base to continue to grow as i our recently launched products gain marketplace acceptance  ii we develop additional products and services and iii we launch our products and services in new international territories 
we have incurred operating losses and net losses since our inception and  as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
since the beginning of  however  we have made significant progress in reducing our annual operating loss and annual net loss 
our operating loss decreased from million in to million in and to million in likewise  our net loss decreased from million in to million in and to million in our ability to reduce our operating and net losses  and our belief that we will make further progress in reducing such losses in  is attributable to a number of factors 
first  we expect the revenue growth we have experienced in the past few years to continue 
second  a significant initial investment was required to launch certain of our services in and  including our megapanel services  and while the ongoing expense to operate such services will continue  we expect such expenses to be less than the initial expenses required to launch such services 
in addition  because we offer syndicated panel services  and because we are able to utilize our existing databases to expand our custom analytical offerings  our revenue growth does not require a corresponding increase in our expenses 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  which we believe is sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
industry trends the success of our business depends heavily on the expanding use of the internet for advertising  commerce and communications 
internet advertising  e commerce and the number of people logging onto the internet  particularly through the use of internet broadband connections  have dramatically increased in recent years and we expect this growth to continue in upcoming years both in the united states and abroad 
these growth trends have made the internet an increasingly important component of companies overall business strategies 
as a result  companies conducting business online are increasingly seeking analysis and insights to i define and reach their target audiences  ii measure the effectiveness of their advertising and marketing strategies  iii benchmark their performance with their competitors and iv increase brand equity and commerce revenue 
companies are also increasingly recognizing that  compared with other media  the internet allows online market participants to obtain a unique understanding of consumer behavior 
unlike with other forms of advertising  including print  radio and television  advertisers can i target advertising in an unprecedented manner  ii confirm whether consumers have actually viewed advertisements and when and iii decipher whether consumers have taken certain actions  whether completing a purchase or visting a web site  and understand exactly why 
because of the unique dynamics of the internet  we expect that internet advertising and commerce will not only continue to grow in coming years  but that internet advertising and commerce will garner a larger percentage of total advertising and commerce dollars 
we believe that this growth will require a commensurate increase in internet media and market research  and that we are particularly well suited to address the global needs of online participants 
product portfolio our goal for the last few years has been to offer the most comprehensive global portfolio of internet media and market research products and services 
in order to reach this goal  we have focused on both strategic acquisitions in the united states and abroad and investing in new products to meet changing marketplace needs 
as a result of these efforts  we currently offer a wide range of products and services in the united states and in many countries throughout europe  asia pacific and latin america 
we believe that this product portfolio and breadth of coverage will enable us to continue to increase our client base  increase our ability to sell multiple products to clients and increase the total sales to individual clients 
in the first half of  we acquired adrelevance  our online advertising expenditure service  and plan  which provides demographic  lifestyle and product preference information 
during  we also made strategic acquisitions designed to expand our netview service around the world  which provides detailed panel based internet audience information 
these included our acquisition of netvalue sa  an international provider of internet audience measurement services  and the purchase from acnielsen corporation of the interest in acnielsen eratings 
com that we did not already own 
since the beginning of  we have acquired lemonad now branded adrelevance i  our international online advertising measurement service  and red sheriff  a global provider of site centric based internet audience measurement tools 
in conjunction with these strategic acquisitions  we have also devoted significant resources to internal product development 
our key new products and services include i megapanel  which includes our vertical offerings  such as megaview financial  megaview retail and megaview search  as well as webintercept  a behavioral based online survey research tool that provides surveying capabilities on real time internet behavior  and ii homescan online  a joint initiative with acnielsen that combines offline consumer purchasing data with internet audience measurement data 
we believe these new products and services  as well as additional megapanel offerings  will be important to our financial performance over the next few years 
revenue overview we generate revenues primarily from the sale of our internet media and market research products and services  which include both syndicated products and customized products 
syndicated products currently represent a very significant majority of our total revenues  and our goal is for syndicated products to continue to represent a significant majority of our total revenues 
we sell a majority of our syndicated products and services on an annual subscription basis 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our syndicated products and services ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
subscription fees invoiced in advance are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
revenue from customized products and services is recognized in the period in which the product or service is provided 
as a result  a significant portion of revenue recognized in any period results from the amortization of deferred revenue balances

com 
in each of these locations  revenue is allocated between netratings and the subsidiary or joint venture company depending on the location of the customer and the location of the panel whose data is used in the service 
as a result of the red sheriff acquisition  we also obtained a ownership interest in an italian company  red sheriff srl  which offers site centric based services in italy 
on february   we purchased the remaining of red sheriff srl we have experienced revenue growth in each of the years since we launched our first product in  as demonstrated by the table below years ended december revenues in thousands we expect our revenues to exceed our revenues  primarily as a result of sales from our new products and services and the launch of our new and existing products and services in new international territories 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  investments  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
our management bases its estimates and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgment regarding the collectibility of those fees 
we sell a majority of our products and services pursuant to one year subscription agreements 
we recognize revenue from the sale of these subscription products and services ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
subscription fees invoiced are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
if a contract s collectibility comes into question  revenue recognition is discontinued until collectibility is reasonably assured 
this determination is based on management s judgment and could adversely affect both revenue and deferred revenue 
accounting for joint venture transactions the results of operations for each joint venture entity are reflected in the consolidated results of operations beginning on the date that we acquired majority control of such entity 
in the second quarter of  we acquired a majority interest in acnielsen eratings 
com 
in the second quarter of  we acquired a majority interest in netratings japan  our japanese joint venture  and in the fourth quarter of  we acquired a majority interest in mediametrie netratings  our french joint venture 
our transactions with these three entities prior to our acquisition of majority control  as well as our transactions with our latin american joint venture  ibope eratings 
com  and our italian joint venture  red sheriff srl  are accounted for in our financial statements as set forth below 
in the first quarter of  we acquired the remaining interest in red sheriff srl and we will  as a result  consolidate the results of operations for such entity from the date of acquisition 
our joint ventures pay us a royalty for the use of our technology 
this royalty revenue is based on a percentage of each sale made by our equity method investees pursuant to each joint venture s operating agreement 
this revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the contract in our statement of operations 
our joint venture partners maintain internet audience measurement panels in the countries in which the joint ventures are located 
revenue from internet audience measurement services  which can either be sold by us or the joint venture partner  is allocated between the two parties based on the location of the customer and the location of the panel whose data is used in the service 
we record commission revenue and expense related to these sales ratably over the period of the contract in the revenue and cost of revenue lines in our statement of operations 
we provide data hosting and support services to the joint ventures 
we charge the joint venture for their share of the data center costs which is recorded as a reduction to our actual data center costs included in the cost of revenue line in our statement of operations 
each of the transactions described in the three preceding paragraphs is included in the operating statement of our equity method joint ventures as well 
we record our percentage of the joint venture s net profit loss in the net equity in earnings losses of joint ventures line in our statement of operations 
bad debt we manage credit risk on accounts receivable by performing ongoing credit evaluations of our customers  reviewing our accounts and contracts and by providing appropriate allowances for uncollectible amounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make contractually required payments 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowances are based on management s judgment which considers historical experience and specific knowledge of accounts that may not be collectible 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as described in note of our financial statements 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses  in accordance with fas a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual case 
losses are recognized for legal contingencies when both the probability of occurrence and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe the outcomes to these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
nonetheless  it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategy related to these proceedings 
goodwill and intangible assets our long lived assets include goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are not amortized  but are reviewed at least annually for impairment 
we retain an independent appraisal firm which annually provides a valuation of our company s fair value  based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
this cash flow analysis requires significant judgment and estimates by management relating to assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates 
an impairment loss is recorded if the estimated future cash flows plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
our estimate of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model and changes in operating performance 
an impairment loss recorded in the future  if any  could have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill and intangibles as of october  at which time no impairment was indicated 
there has been no indication of impairment since october  results of operations the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain financial data as a percentage of revenue revenue costs of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring and other expenses litigation settlement recovery acquisition related expenses amortization of intangibles stock based compensation total operating expenses loss from operations interest income  net loss on joint ventures impairment of investments minority interest net loss the following table sets forth operating results for each of the four quarters ended december  and q q q q in thousands  except per share data unaudited revenue gross profit loss from operations net loss basic and diluted net loss per share q q q q in thousands  except per share data unaudited revenue gross profit loss from operations net loss basic and diluted net loss per share year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue

as a percentage of revenue  our cost of revenue decreased from to this decrease is due to the fact that a large portion of the expense related to launching a new product is incurred prior to the launch of such product

the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap total the expected timing of payment of the purchase obligations set forth above  which consist primarily of panel and data center costs  is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
while we have historically made additional contributions to our joint ventures in order to maintain our ownership percentage  we are not contractually required to make such contributions 
in the event of a request for capital infusion  we have the option as to whether or not we participate in the round of funding 
should we elect not to participate  our equity position would be diluted in that joint venture 
we believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months  although we could elect to seek additional funding prior to that time 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item of regulation s k 
risk factors that may affect our performance an investment in our company involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks below  together with the other information contained in this report  before you make an investment decision with respect to our company 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
any of the following risks could i materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition  ii cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and iii cause you to lose all or part of your investment 
we have incurred losses since our inception and we may be unable to achieve profitability we incurred net losses of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we intend to continue to incur significant expenditures as our company grows and as we expand our portfolio of products and services 
as a result  we will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
we may not be able to achieve significant revenue growth in the future 
our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we may not achieve sufficient revenue to become profitable 
we have a limited operating history in the evolving market for internet audience measurement and analysis we were incorporated in july and did not start generating revenue until the quarter ended september  we introduced our netview service in the quarter ended september  many of our other products and services were first offered by us during the last few years 
accordingly  we are still in the early stages of development and have only a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business 
one should evaluate our likelihood of financial and operational success in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses  delays and difficulties associated with an early stage business in an evolving market  many of which may be beyond our control  including the risk that a competing company s internet audience measurement service will become the accepted standard in the marketplace  the extent of growth  if any  in the internet media research and market research markets  potential inability to successfully manage any significant growth we may achieve in the future  potential inability to successfully integrate any acquired business  technology or service  and the risks associated with operating a business in numerous international markets 
if our new products or services do not generate the revenues that we anticipate  our financial results will suffer during the past few years  we launched a number of new products and services that we believe will generate interest in the marketplace and result in increased revenues in the coming years 
our financial results during and beyond will depend in part on the success of these new product initiatives and our ability to generate meaningful revenues from them 
if we fail in our efforts to market and sell these new products and services  our financial results will be negatively affected 
furthermore  we believe that our new products and services fill gaps in our product portfolio and that the introduction of new products will not result in decreased sales of our existing products 
if we are mistaken in our view of the marketplace  and the introduction of these new products results in decreased sales of our existing portfolio  then our financial results will also be negatively affected 
our quarterly revenues may fluctuate significantly and because our expense levels are based in large part on our estimates of future revenues  an unexpected shortfall in revenue would significantly harm our operating results and could lead to reduced prices for our stock due to the evolving nature of our business and the markets in which we compete  our future revenue is difficult to forecast 
further  our expense levels are based largely on our investment plans and estimates of future revenue 
we may be unable to adjust our spending to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenue 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in revenue relative to our planned expenditures in a particular quarter would harm our results of operations and could lead our stock price to fall sharply  particularly following quarters in which our operating results fail to meet expectations 
factors that may cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating results on a quarterly basis include the following  some of which are beyond our control the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business  the amount and timing of costs related to changes in the size or composition of our panels  particularly as a result of turnover among panel members  the impact on our renewal rates caused by our customers budgetary constraints or a perceived lack of need for our services  changes in demand for our products and services due to the announcement or introduction of new products and services or the cancellation of existing products and services by us or our competitors  changes in the pricing of our products and services in light of the services and pricing offered by our competitors  the impact of possible acquisitions or equity investments both on our operations and on our reported operating results due to associated accounting charges  and technical difficulties or service interruptions that significantly harm our ability to deliver our products and services on schedule 
we have limited ability to forecast the rate at which subscriptions for our services may be renewed  and we may not achieve sufficiently high renewal rates to become profitable we derive a large percentage of our revenue from annual subscriptions for our services 
as our business becomes more established  we expect subscription renewals and sales of additional products and services to existing customers to account for an increasing proportion of our revenue 
any unexpectedly low renewal rates or a reduction in the number of products and services that we are able to sell to existing customers would harm our operating results and could prevent us from becoming profitable 
to date  renewals have been an essential element of our revenue growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve or sustain high renewal rates  particularly during an economic downturn 
additionally  because many internet related businesses are still in the early stages of development  consolidations in our customer base or the failure of a significant number of our customers businesses could cause a decline in renewal rates for our products and services 
if the internet advertising and electronic commerce markets develop slower than we expect  our business will suffer our future success will depend on an increase in the use of the internet as an advertising medium  the proliferation of e commerce and the use of the internet as part of multi channel marketing strategies 
these markets and marketing techniques are fairly new and rapidly evolving  and it is not certain that the current trends will continue throughout the world 
the adoption of internet advertising  particularly by entities that have historically relied on traditional media for advertising  requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business 
these companies may find internet advertising to be less effective than traditional advertising for promoting their products and services 
they may also be unwilling to pay premium rates for advertising that is targeted at specific types of users based on demographic profiles or recent internet behavior 
the internet advertising and e commerce markets may also be adversely affected by privacy issues surrounding the targeting of this type of advertising or the use of personal information 
providers of goods and services online continue to work toward the establishment of commerce models that are cost effective and unique  and effectively deal with issues such as channel conflict and infrastructure costs 
growth in the use of the internet for e commerce may not continue  or the internet may not be adopted as a medium of commerce by a broad base of customers worldwide 
because of the foregoing factors  among others  the market for internet advertising and e commerce may not continue to grow or grow at significant rates 
if these markets fail to develop or develop slower than we expect  our business will suffer 
the market for internet audience measurement and analysis is highly competitive  and if we cannot compete effectively  our revenues will decline the market for internet audience measurement and analysis is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
we compete with a number of companies in the market for internet audience measurement services and analytical services  and we expect competition in this market to intensify in the future 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are the ability to provide high quality  accurate and reliable data regarding internet audience behavior and activity in a timely manner  the breadth and depth of the product and services offered and their flexibility and ease of use  the availability of data across various geographic areas  the ability to offer high quality analytical services based on the internet audience measurement information  the ability to offer products and services that meet the changing needs of our customers  and the prices that are charged for the products and services  as well as the general economic conditions 
some of our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  or devote more resources to technology and systems development 
in light of these factors  we may be unable to compete successfully in our market 
if we fail to successfully close and integrate acquisitions  our business will suffer we may continue to acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
negotiating such acquisitions can be difficult  time consuming and expensive and our ability to close such transactions may often be subject to approvals  such as governmental regulation  which are beyond our control 
consequently  we can make no assurances that such acquisitions  once undertaken and announced  will close 
further  the process of integrating any acquired business  technology  service or product into our business may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of an acquired company may also consume significant management time and attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
we may be unable to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions or investments successfully  or to integrate successfully any acquisitions with our current business 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could harm our business 
investor confidence and our share price may be adversely impacted if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of the securities and exchange commission  pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in its annual reports on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  a public company s independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of such company s internal control over financial reporting 
these reports and attestations were originally required to be filed with this annual report on form k 
in late november  the securities and exchange commission issued an exemptive order providing a day extension for the filing of these reports and attestations by eligible companies 
because we elected to utilize this day extension  our deadline for filing these reports has been extended 
these reports will be included in an amended form k expected to be filed within the deadlines prescribed by the exemptive order 
if our independent registered public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented  designed  operated  or reviewed  or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements  rules or regulations differently from us  then they may decline to attest to management s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified 
in the event that management is unable to complete its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest to management s assessment  then we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny  class action lawsuits and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls 
in addition  any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of our shares 
we are dependent on nielsen media research and acnielsen for various services related to our domestic and international operations the data for our netview service is collected from randomly selected panels of internet users 
our netview internet audience measurement panel in the united states has been developed and is maintained by nielsen media research as part of our strategic relationship with that company 
in addition  acnielsen has granted us a license to use acnielsen s sampling methodology and the nielsen name outside north america in the internet audience measurement business  and has entered into a service agreement to provide us with the services of certain dedicated marketing and panel management personnel who are employed by acnielsen  as well as specific back office services 
accordingly  for a significant period of time  we expect that our business will be substantially dependent upon these arrangements for the continued maintenance of our international internet audience measurement panels and for other international business operations 
any failure on the part of nielsen media research  acnielsen or our other business partners to devote adequate resources to the development or maintenance of such panels or other sampling methodologies  or to maintain the overall quality of these methodologies  will harm our business 
in addition  nielsen media research may terminate its obligations with respect to internet audience measurement panels in the event it no longer holds at least of our outstanding stock on a fully diluted basis 
vnu nv  through its wholly owned subsidiaries nielsen media research and acnielsen  controls a majority of our outstanding stock and its representatives constitute a majority of our board of directors vnu  nv  through its wholly owned subsidiaries nielsen media research and acnielsen  has a majority stock ownership position in netratings  which enables it to control the direction and policies of netratings  including the election of our board of directors  amendment of our certificate of incorporation  and decisions regarding mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
this control may have the effect of discouraging certain types of transactions involving a change of control 
in addition  vnu can control or influence the terms of our important commercial transactions  including our strategic relationships with nielsen media research and acnielsen 
vnu s representatives on our board are expected to recuse themselves from deliberations in which they have a conflict of interest 
however  these directors may take actions that favor vnu s interests over the interests of other stockholders  as a result  for instance  of conflicts of interest that are not apparent at the time of such actions 
our brand is dependent on the reputations of third parties over which we have no control the strength of the nielsen netratings brand is also closely dependent on the reputations of nielsen media research  acnielsen and other business partners and the strength of their brands 
therefore  any negative publicity generated by nielsen media research  acnielsen or our other business partners  whether or not directly related to any nielsen netratings branded products or services  as well as any erosion of the strength of any of their brands  will adversely affect our own brand identity 
our costs to develop and maintain accurate internet audience measurement panels  including panels for our megapanel service  are significant and may increase we believe that the quality  size and scope of our panels are critical to the success of our business 
to date  the expense of recruiting and operating our audience measurement panels has made up a very significant portion of the cost of revenue reported on our financial statements and  therefore  any increase in this expense will likely result in a decrease in our gross margin 
the costs associated with maintaining the quality  size and scope are dependent on many factors some of which are beyond our control  including the cooperation rate of potential panel members and turnover among existing panel members  and accordingly we cannot necessarily control these costs to match increases or decreases in revenue 
to the extent that such additional expenses are not accompanied by increased revenue  our results of operations will be harmed 
recruiting panelists for our megapanel service in europe and the united states has also required significant investment and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain panels of sufficient size to meet client demand 
we have limited experience in developing internet audience measurement panels  and we could experience lower cooperation rates or higher turnover rates in the future 
our international operations pose unique risks that may divert our management s attention and resources as a result of our acquisitions in the past few years  we offer our products and services in numerous countries around the world 
our international markets will require significant management attention and resources 
in addition  there can be no assurance of the continued growth of internet usage and electronic commerce in international markets 
the international markets for audience measurement services have historically been localized and difficult to penetrate 
the success of our international operations will depend on our ability to effectively select the appropriate countries to serve  recruit and maintain panels that are representative of a geographic area  control costs and effectively manage foreign operations  manage third party vendors who will likely perform panel operations  and effectively develop  market  and sell new products and services in new  unfamiliar markets 
even if we are successful in managing our international operations  we will be subject to a number of risks inherent in engaging in international operations  including changes in regulatory requirements  deficiencies in the telecommunications infrastructure in some countries  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  more rigorous levels of privacy protection in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  economic and political instability  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
our business may be harmed if we supply inaccurate information to our customers if we furnish inaccurate information to our customers  our brand may be harmed 
the information that we collect and information in our databases may contain inaccuracies that our customers may not accept 
any dissatisfaction by our customers with our measurement or collection methodologies or databases could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers and could ultimately harm our brand 
our customer contracts generally provide that each customer must indemnify us for any damages arising from the use of data  reports or analyses by the customer or the performance of any consulting  analytic or other services by us 
however  we cannot be certain that our contract provisions provide sufficient protection and  in any event  enforcing these protections could be very costly 
any liability that we incur or any harm to our brand that we suffer because of irregularities or inaccuracies in the data we supply to our customers could harm our business 
concern over spyware could impair our ability to recruit panelists or maintain panels of sufficient size to meet client demand  which in turn could materially adversely affect our ability to provide our products and services public concern has increased recently regarding certain kinds of downloadable software known as spyware and adware 
these types of programs are often installed on a computer without the consent of the user or without the user s full understanding while navigating the internet 
concern over spyware and adware might cause users to be less inclined to download software from the internet  including our proprietary metering technology  which could make it difficult to recruit additional panelists or maintain panels of sufficient size to meet client demand 
moreover  in response to spyware and adware concerns  numerous programs are available many of which are available for free that claim to identify and remove spyware and adware from users computers 
while our technology is not spyware  some of these anti spyware programs have identified our software as spyware or as a potential spyware application 
we actively seek to persuade the authors of these anti spyware programs that our software should not be included on their lists of spyware applications or potential spyware applications 
however  to the extent that we are not successful  or to the extent that new anti spyware programs classify our software as spyware or as a potential spyware application  our goodwill might be harmed and users of these programs might uninstall our software 
loss of goodwill or a decrease in the size of our panels could increase the cost of recruiting panelists and materially adversely affect our ability to provide our products and services to our clients  which in turn could cause our expected revenues to decline 
technological changes may result in widespread blocking or erasing of cookies  which could reduce the amount and value of the information we collect and adversely affect our ability to provide our products and services to clients our sitecensus technology currently uses cookies and action tags to track the behavior of internet users 
cookies are small files of information placed on an internet user s computer to collect information about the user s visits to a web site 
an action tag  also known as web beacon  pixel tag  and clear gif  generally consists of a small string of invisible code that represents a graphic image request on a web page that companies place on their web sites to allow them to analyze the general usage patterns of visitors to their web sites 
third party software and our own technology and privacy policy make it easy for users to block or delete our cookies 
software programs  sometimes marketed as adware or spyware detectors  may block our cookies by default or prompt users to delete or block our cookies 
if a large percentage of users delete or block our cookies  this could  among other things  reduce the amount and value of the information we collect  cause us to spend substantial money and time to change our technology  and adversely affect our ability to provide our sitecensus service to our clients 
changes in web browsers may also encourage users to block our cookies or impair our ability to use cookies and action tags for data collection purposes 
technologies like the platform for privacy preferences pp may also limit the collection of information from cookies and action tags 
if these or other technological changes are implemented and we are unable to adapt our technology and practices adequately in response to these changes  then the value of our sitecensus service will be substantially impaired 
privacy concerns could lead to legislative  regulatory and other limitations that could affect our ability to collect and use information about internet users  impair our ability to provide our products and services to clients and expose us to liability privacy concerns could lead to legislative  judicial and regulatory limitations on our ability to collect  maintain and use information about internet users both in the united states and abroad 
restrictions could be placed upon the collection  management  aggregation and use of information  which could require significant engineering time and resources 
recently  the legislatures of the states of utah and california enacted legislation designed to protect internet users privacy by prohibiting certain kinds of downloadable software defined as spyware 
similar legislation has been introduced in other states and the us congress  including the safeguard against privacy invasions act in the house of representatives and the spyblock act in the senate 
in addition  the european union has adopted a directive requiring the disclosure of the use of cookies and instructions on their removal 
it is possible that this legislation or future legislation intended to regulate spyware could affect our ability to collect information  which could prevent us from operating or distributing some of our products and services or which could require us to change our business practices 
in addition  failure to comply with the law and regulatory requirements may result in  among other things  administrative enforcement actions and fines  class action lawsuits and civil and criminal liability 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could materially harm our business  results of operation and financial condition 
we may not be successful in the development or introduction of new products and services to keep up with the proliferation of alternative internet access devices and technologies related to the expected convergence of the internet and television we believe that an increasing proportion of internet use will involve alternative internet access devices such as web enabled phones  television set top boxes and internet enabled gaming consoles and that there will eventually be a convergence of internet content and television programming 
accordingly  in order to continue to provide information about audience behavior throughout all major segments of the internet  we will be required to develop new products and services that address these evolving technologies 
we may be unsuccessful in identifying new product and service opportunities or in developing or marketing new products and services in a timely or cost effective manner 
in addition  product innovations may not achieve the market penetration or price stability necessary for profitability 
finally  we may not be successful in adapting our data collection software to evolving types of internet access devices or content 
if we are unable to provide audience measurement information regarding any significant segments of internet use  demand for our products and services may suffer 
we may not be able to recruit or retain qualified personnel our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees in many locations around the world 
although we provide compensation packages that include competitive salaries  stock options  restricted stock  bonus incentives and other employee benefits  we may be unable to retain our key employees or to attract  assimilate and retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
if we are unable to attract or retain key employees  our business would suffer 
the audience measurement services offered by nielsen media research or acnielsen may eventually have features that overlap with features of our internet audience measurement services as a result of convergence of television and the internet nielsen media research s principal business consists of providing television audience measurement services based on audience panels that it develops independent of its strategic relationship with us 
acnielsen also derives a substantial portion of its revenue from television audience measurement services outside of the united states 
if television and the internet converge in the future as expected  any internet audience information that is reported by television audience measurement services through these vnu subsidiaries may overlap with the audience information that is reported by the nielsen netratings internet audience measurement services 
in the event of such overlap  vnu s services could begin competing with our services for the same research budgets among customers in the marketplace  and its offering of such services could conflict with its obligation to develop and maintain our internet audience panels 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights we regard our intellectual property as critical to our success 
we rely on patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights  and we seek to obtain the issuances of patents for our core technology and the registration of our material trademarks and service marks in the united states and in selected other countries 
we cannot assure you  however  that the steps we have taken will be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from infringement or misappropriation 
moreover  effective intellectual property protections may not be available in every country in which we offer our products and services to the extent these protections are available in the united states 
our patent applications or trademark registrations may not be approved or  even if approved  could be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation 
if our patent applications or trademark registrations are not approved because third parties own rights to the technology we are trying to patent or the trademarks we are trying to register  our use of such technology or trademark would be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with the third party owners  which might not be possible on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that would be costly to resolve or may require us to make changes to our technology or business third parties may  from time to time  assert claims that we have infringed upon their proprietary rights or claims that our own trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid 
such claims could adversely affect our reputation and the value of our own proprietary rights 
from time to time we have been  and we may in the future be  subject to such claims in the ordinary course of our business  including claims of alleged infringement of patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
protection of proprietary rights in internet related industries is inherently uncertain due to the rapidly evolving technological environment 
as such  there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  that provide for technologies similar to ours 
any claims of infringement and any resulting litigation  should they occur  could subject us to significant liability for damages  restrict us from using our technology or from operating our business generally or require us to make changes to our technology 
any claims of this type  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and divert management attention and resources 
in addition  such claims could result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims unless we are able to enter into royalty  licensing or other similar arrangements with the third parties asserting these claims 
such agreements  if required  may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to enter into these types of agreements  we may be required to either cease offering the subject product or change our technology underlying the applicable product 
if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non infringing technology or to license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis  it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
system failures or delays in the operation of our computer and communications systems may harm our business our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
a failure of our network or data gathering procedures could impede the processing of data  customer orders and day to day management of our business and could result in the corruption or loss of data 
the servers on which we collect our panel members data reside in nielsen media research s facilities in oldsmar  florida 
we currently do not have a backup facility to provide redundant network capacity in the event of a system failure 
accordingly  our ability to collect internet audience data in real time is dependent upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of nielsen media research s computer and communications hardware and software systems 
despite any precautions we may take  damage from fire  floods  hurricanes  power loss  telecommunications failures  computer viruses  break ins and similar events at nielsen media research s computer facility could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers 
in addition  any failure by nielsen media research s computer facility to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service 
in the event nielsen media research should discontinue its services to us  we would be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services 
such a transfer could be costly and result in significant delays in our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers  which could damage our reputation and harm our business 
we intend to develop back up systems outside of nielsen media research s facilities in oldsmar  florida 
however  as we replicate our systems at other locations  we will face a number of technical challenges  particularly with respect to database replications  which we may not be able to address successfully 
although we carry property and business interruption insurance  our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 
any misappropriation of personal information about our panelists that is stored on our computers could harm our reputation or expose us to claims arising from damages suffered by those panelists personal information regarding our panelists is included in the data that our software captures from a panelist s internet use 
our panel data are released only on an anonymous basis 
however  if a person were to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate sensitive data about our panel members  our reputation could be harmed or we could be subject to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by panel members as a result of such misappropriation 
under california sb  companies that maintain data on california residents are required to inform individuals of any security breaches that result in their personal information being stolen 
in the event that any personal information about our panelists residing in california was misappropriated  we could incur significant costs in complying with the disclosure requirements of california sb in addition  any such disclosure could harm our reputation and result in a higher rate of panel attrition 
governmental regulation of the internet might harm our business the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  libel and personal privacy is uncertain 
in addition  governmental authorities in various countries may seek to further regulate the internet with respect to issues such as user privacy  pornography  acceptable content  advertising  e commerce  taxation and the pricing  characteristics and quality of products and services 
therefore  any new legislation regulating the internet could inhibit the growth of the internet and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications and commercial medium  which might harm our business 
finally  the global nature of the internet could subject us to the laws of a foreign jurisdiction in an unpredictable manner 
legislative actions  higher insurance costs and regulatory requirements applicable to public registrants are likely to cause our general and administrative expenses to increase and may impact our future financial position and results of operations in order to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as changes to nasdaq listing standards and rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission  we may be required to enhance our internal controls and hire additional personnel and additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services  all of which will cause our general and administrative costs to increase 
for example  in we hired outside consultants to assist us with our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which resulted in additional general and administrative expenses during insurers may also increase premiums  causing our premiums for various insurance policies  including our directors and officers insurance policy  to increase 
changes in the accounting rules  in particular the rules relating to accounting for employee stock options  could materially increase the expenses that we report under generally accepted accounting principles and adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  any such changes may impact the amount of stock options we grant to our employees  which may affect our ability to recruit or retain key employees 
we are subject to pending legal proceedings we are currently subject to a securities class action complaint relating to our initial public offering 
the plaintiffs allege that our prospectus was materially false and misleading because it failed to disclose that the underwriters required several investors who sought large allocations of stock in the offering to pay excessive underwriters compensation in the form of increased brokerage commissions on other trades and required investors to agree to buy shares of our stock after the offering was completed at predetermined prices as a precondition to obtaining allocations in the offering 
the plaintiffs further allege that because of these purchases  our stock price after its initial public offering was artificially inflated 
similar complaints have been filed against a number of other issuers that had initial public offerings in and while we have accepted a settlement proposal from the plaintiffs  the settlement is subject to approval of the judge 
if the settlement is not approved by the judge  the litigation will continue 
an adverse outcome could materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
a sale by vnu of its stake in netratings could adversely affect our stock price there are no contractual restrictions on the ability of vnu  through its nielsen media research or acnielsen subsidiaries  to sell shares of our common stock  although sales in the public market will be subject to the volume limitations of sec rule pursuant to these volume limitations  a controlling stockholder may sell shares under rule only if the shares to be sold  together with the shares sold during the past three months  do not exceed the greater of of the issuer s outstanding shares or the average weekly trading volume of the issuer s shares during the preceding four calendar weeks 
nielsen media research  acnielsen and several of our other stockholders have the right  under certain circumstances  to require us to register their stock for sale to the public  with the exception of the shares issued to acnielsen in the acquisition of eratings 
should vnu decide to sell its stake in netratings  it could adversely affect our stock price 
additionally  vnu will have the ability to transfer control of netratings  possibly at a premium over the then current market price 
because vnu will have the ability to effect such a transfer of control unilaterally  other stockholders could be denied an opportunity to participate in the transaction and receive a premium for their shares 
delaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make more difficult the acquisition of us by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest or otherwise  and the removal of incumbent officers and directors 
these provisions include section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a merger with a or greater stockholder  such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer  until three years after that party became a or greater stockholder  the authorization in the certificate of incorporation of undesignated preferred stock  which could be issued without stockholder approval in a manner designed to prevent or discourage a takeover  and provisions in our bylaws eliminating stockholders rights to call a special meeting of stockholders and requiring advance notice of any stockholder nominations of director candidates or any stockholder proposal to be presented at an annual meeting  which could make it more difficult for stockholders to wage a proxy contest for control of our board or to vote to repeal any of the anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
item a
