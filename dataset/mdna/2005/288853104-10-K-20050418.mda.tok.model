represents the distribution channel in the uk our competitive strengths we believe that our competitive strengths position us to capitalize on several trends that have affected the apparel industry in recent years 
these trends include the consolidation of the department and chain store distribution channels into a smaller number of larger retailers and the increased importance of mass merchants in certain apparel segments  
table of contents the increased dependence of retailers on reliable suppliers who have design expertise  advanced systems and technology  and the ability to quickly meet changing consumer tastes  the continued importance of strong brands as a source of product differentiation

we license the nike  tommy hilfiger  ping  ocean pacific and pga tour brands  which we believe are highly recognizable brands within their various product categories 
we also license several of our brands to third parties for products in distribution channels and countries in which we do not distribute those brands 
we believe that brand recognition is critical in the apparel industry  where strong brand names help define consumer preferences and drive selling space at retailers 
diversified product offering and distribution model 
we market a diverse array of products under our numerous brands at multiple price points and across multiple levels of retail distribution 
our menswear offerings include casual sportswear and bottoms  dress shirts and pants  jeans wear  golf apparel  sweaters  sports apparel  swimwear and swim accessories  activewear and leather accessories

we have established relationships with many licensees and believe these relationships provide opportunities to grow our revenues and earnings 
our brands are solidly positioned in retail outlets at all major levels of retail distribution and have increased our exposure nationally and internationally 
we believe that our broad portfolio of brands also appeals to licensees because it gives licensees the opportunity to sell their products into different distribution channels 
for example  a manufacturer of men s accessories might license the cubavera brand to enter the department store channel or license the munsingwear brand to target the national and regional chain stores 
by licensing our owned brands  we offer consumers a complete product assortment by brand 
we also coordinate our marketing efforts with licensees  thereby maximizing exposure for our brands and our return on investment 
sophisticated global low cost sourcing capabilities 
we have sourced our products globally for more than years and employ sophisticated logistics and supply chain management systems to maintain maximum flexibility 
our network of worldwide sourcing partners enables us to meet our customers needs in an efficient and high quality manner without relying on any one vendor  factory  or country 
in fiscal  based on the total dollar value  we sourced our products from asia  central and south america  the middle east and other areas of the world 
we maintain a staff of experienced sourcing professionals in five offices in china including hong kong  as well as in the united states  south korea  taiwan  vietnam and the dominican republic

design expertise and advanced technology 
we maintain a staff of designers  merchandisers and artists who are supported by a staff of design professionals  including assistant designers  technical designers  graphic artists and production assistants 
our in house design staff designs substantially all of our products using advanced computer aided design technology that minimizes the time intensive and costly production of sewn prototypes prior to customer approval

we use perrysolutions  our software system  which enables our sales planners to manage our retail customers inventory at the sku level 
this system helps maximize the sales and margins of our products by increasing inventory turns for the retailer  which in turn reduces our product returns and markdowns and increases our profitability 
we also use perrysolutions during the assortment planning process to allocate the correct quantities for the initial rollout of product at retail 
proven ability to integrate acquisitions 
since  we have been successful in selectively acquiring  managing  developing and positioning highly recognized brands within our business  including munsingwear  perry ellis  john henry  manhattan  jantzen  perry ellis menswear and redsand 
we believe our experience has prepared us for the integration of the tropical business 
as part of an extensive integration process for each brand  we have improved the responsiveness to market trends by applying our design and sourcing expertise  communicated new positioning of our new brands through various wide ranging marketing programs  solidified our management team to design  market and license brands  repositioned the brands into different distribution channels to address the needs in those channels  renegotiated existing licensing agreements and sought new licensing opportunities in new segments and markets  and extended our sourcing and distribution capabilities to the products

our business strategy our strategy is to continue to pursue our three dimensional approach by developing and enhancing our portfolio of brands  increasing the scope of our product offerings and expanding distribution for our brands  while continuing our focus on growth and profitability through the execution of the following strategies continue to strengthen the competitive position and recognition of our brands 
we intend to continue enhancing the recognition of our brands by aggressively marketing our brands to both consumers and retailers 
we manage each brand individually  developing a distinct brand and marketing strategy for every product category and distribution channel 
we participate in cooperative advertising in print and broadcast media  as well as market directly to consumers through billboards  event sponsorships  celebrity sponsorships  special event advertisements and advertisements in selected periodicals 
in addition  we continue to have a strong presence at trade shows  such as magic in las vegas  market week in new york  and golf and swim shows and events throughout the country 
licensing our brands to third parties also enhances brand recognition by providing increased customer exposure domestically and internationally  as well as opportunities for future product extensions 
continue to diversify our product line 
we intend to continue to expand the range of our product lines  thereby capitalizing on the name recognition  popularity  and discrete target customer segmentation of our major brands 
for example  we are introducing a premium denim  women s sportswear and men s suit line under the original penguin brand and introduced men s sportswear under the jantzen brand 
the perry ellis menswear acquisition took us into the men s better market and collection market for sportswear  dress shirts  bottoms and leather accessories and  through the axis and tricots st 
raphael brands into the better sportswear market 
we have used the axis and tricots st 
raphael brands  as well as the expertise of perry ellis menswear s sales and marketing personnel  to expand our sweater business 
in addition  we will continue to seek licensing opportunities that will expand our collection of products 

table of contents increase penetration in each channel 
we will continue to selectively pursue new ways to increase our penetration of existing channels of distribution for our products  focusing on maintaining the integrity of our products and reinforcing our image at existing retail stores  as well as introducing our products to geographic areas and consumer sectors that are presently less familiar with our products 
we will also seek to expand our business with our existing customers by offering them products that are compelling and different from those in the marketplace and by capitalizing on our relationships with them by offering them more of our products 
as a result of the perry ellis menswear acquisition  we have increased the number of retailers that carry our brands and entered certain upscale department stores  such as nordstrom  which carry the axis and tricots st 
raphael brands 
in addition  as a result of the tropical acquisition  we will increase our penetration with some of our existing customers 
adapt to our continually changing marketplace 
we will continue to make the necessary investments and implement strategies to meet the growing needs of our customers on a timely basis in the ever changing apparel industry 
we have a history of successfully adapting our business to meet the challenges of our industry 
some examples include from our initial efforts to market guayabera shirts to the hispanic market years ago  we have focused on hispanics  the largest minority group in the united states 
we developed the cubavera and the havanera co 
brands in fiscal and  respectively  to specifically target the hispanic market and consumers that embrace the hispanic lifestyle brands

we re introduced the original penguin brand in fiscal  to specifically target generation x and y men and women who are suburban upper middle class  ages to the product line is primarily sold at upscale department and upper tier specialty stores and includes apparel  shoes and accessory items 
the perry ellis menswear acquisition provided us with the upscale axis and tricots st 
raphael brands  as well as greater control of designing and marketing the perry ellis line of men s sportswear  dress shirts  bottoms and leather accessories 
with this acquisition  we believe we have leveraged perry ellis menswear s relationships in order to sell more of our products through these upscale retailers 
we consummated the tropical acquisition because it made us one of the largest supplier of men s bottoms in the united states  strengthened and balanced our product mix  added to our portfolio of brands  and provided us with a strong platform to expand our existing brands into europe 
expand our licensing opportunities 
since our acquisition of munsingwear in  we have significantly expanded the licensing of our brands to third parties for various product categories 
we intend to continue to license our brands to existing and new licensees as profitable opportunities arise

at the international level  we will continue to explore licensing opportunities where we see opportunities for growth  such as latin america  europe and asia 
we will continue to provide our licensing partners with strong brands  design expertise and innovative marketing strategies 
in addition to the revenues and brand awareness that licensing provides us  we also believe that licensing our brands benefits us by reducing the volatility of our operating income 
pursue strategic acquisitions and opportunities 
we intend to continue our strategy of making selective acquisitions to expand our portfolio of brands and add new product lines as our industry continues to follow the consolidation trend of our retailers 
we will continue to internally develop new brands and logical extensions of existing brands as opportunities in the marketplace arise 
we intend to pursue acquisition opportunities in a disciplined manner as they become available and focus on products or categories that have high consumer awareness and are difficult to duplicate from a technical or logistical standpoint 
since our initial public offering in  we have acquired  or obtained licenses for  several brands  including munsingwear  perry ellis  john henry  manhattan  jantzen  ping  tommy hilfiger  nike  mondo di marco  ocean pacific  axis  tricots st

the overall decrease in the private label business as a percentage of our net sales  from fiscal  is a result of the additional net sales of apparel under the brands acquired in the jantzen acquisition  the subsequent license agreements with nike and tommy hilfiger  the perry ellis menswear acquisition  and our decision to focus our efforts on selling branded products

as part of our licensing strategy  we work with our licensees to further enhance the development  image  and sales of their products 
we offer licensees marketing support  and our relationships with retailers help the licensees generate higher revenues 
our license agreements generally extend for a period of three to five years with options to renew prior to expiration for an additional multi year period based upon a licensee meeting certain performance criteria 
the typical agreement requires that the licensee pay us the greater of a royalty based on a percentage of the licensee s net sales of the licensed products or a guaranteed minimum royalty that typically increases over the term of the agreement 
generally  licensees are required to contribute to us additional monies for advertising and promotion of the licensed products in their covered territory 
marketing  distribution and customers we market our apparel products to customers principally through the direct efforts of our in house sales staff  independent commissioned sales representatives who work exclusively for us  and other non exclusive independent commissioned sales representatives who generally market other product lines as well as ours 
we also attend major industry trade shows and market weeks in the apparel industry and trade shows in our swimwear  golf  and corporate businesses 
we operate retail outlet stores through which we sell perry ellis products directly to the public 
these retail stores are generally located in upscale retail outlet malls 
we also operate a retail store in new york through which we sell original penguin products  and operate three stores near our corporate warehouse facilities 
we believe that customer service is a key factor in successfully marketing our apparel products 
we coordinate efforts with customers to develop products meeting their specific needs using our design expertise and computer aided design technology 
utilizing our sourcing capabilities  we strive to produce and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
our in house sales staff is responsible for customer follow up and support  including monitoring prompt order fulfillment and timely delivery 
we utilize an electronic data interchange  or edi  system for certain customers in order to 
table of contents provide advance shipping notices  process orders and conduct billing operations 
in addition  certain customers use the edi system to communicate their weekly inventory requirements per store to us 
we then fill these orders either by shipping directly to the individual stores or by sending shipments  individually packaged and bar coded by store  to a centralized customer distribution center 
we use perrysolutions  our software system that enables our sales planners to manage our retail customers inventory at the sku level 
this system helps maximize the sales and margins of our products by increasing inventory turns for the retailer  which in turn reduces our product returns and markdowns and increases our profitability 
we also use demographic mapping data software that helps us develop specific micro market plans for our customers and provide them with enhanced returns on our various product lines 
we sell merchandise to a broad spectrum of retailers  including national and regional chain  upscale department  mass merchant and specialty stores 
our largest customers include federated  may department stores  dillard s  wal mart  jc penney  kohl s  and sears 
we have developed and maintained long standing relationships with these customers  including dillard s more than years  may department stores more than years  jc penney more than years  sears more years  federated years  wal mart years and kohl s years 
we also sell merchandise to corporate wear distributors 
net sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately   and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
no customer  however  represented more than of our net sales during fiscal for fiscal  net sales to kohl s accounted for approximately of our net sales 
for fiscal  net sales to wal mart accounted for approximately of net sales 
no other single customer accounted for more than of net sales during fiscal and advertising and promotions we advertise to customers through print advertisements in a variety of consumer and trade magazines and newspapers and through outdoor advertising such as billboards strategically placed to be viewed by consumers 
in order to promote our men s sportswear at the retail level  we participate in cooperative advertising in print and broadcast media  which features our products in our customers advertisements 
the cost of this cooperative advertising is shared with our customers 
we also conduct various in store marketing activities with our customers  such as retail events and promotions  the costs of which are shared by our customers 
these events and promotions are in great part orchestrated to coincide with high volume shopping times such as holidays christmas and thanksgiving and father s day 
in addition to event promotion  we place perennial displays and signs of our products in retail establishments 
we use direct consumer advertising in selected markets featuring the perry ellis  cubavera  the havanera co  john henry  natural issue  munsingwear  grand slam and original penguin brand names through the placement of highly visible billboards  sponsorships and special event advertising 
we also maintain informational websites featuring our brands 
we create and implement editorial and public relations strategies designed to heighten the visibility of our brands 
all of these activities are coordinated around each brand in an integrated marketing approach 
seasonality and backlog our products have historically been geared towards lighter weight apparel generally worn during the spring and summer months 
we believe that this seasonality has been reduced with our introduction of fall  winter and holiday merchandise 
the swimwear business  however  is highly seasonal in nature  with the vast majority of our sales occurring in our first and fourth quarter 
we generally receive orders from our retailers approximately five to seven months prior to shipment 
for the majority of our sales  we have orders from our retailers before we place orders with our suppliers 
a summary of the order and delivery cycle for our four primary selling seasons  excluding swimwear  is illustrated below merchandise season advance order period delivery period to retailers spring july to september january to march summer october to december april and may fall january to march june to september holiday april to june october and november sales and receivables are recorded when inventory is shipped 
our backlog of orders includes confirmed and unconfirmed orders  which we believe  based on our past experience and industry practice  will be confirmed 
as of april   subsequent to the tropical acquisition  the backlog for orders of our products  all of which are expected to be shipped during fiscal  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million as of april  the 
table of contents amount of unfilled orders at a point in time is affected by a number of factors  including the mix of product  the timing of the receipt and processing of customer orders and the scheduling of the sourcing and shipping of the product  which in most cases depends on the desires of the customer 
our backlog is also affected by an on going trend among retailers to reduce the lead time on their orders 
in recent years  our customers have been more cautious of their inventory levels and have delayed placing orders and re orders compared to our previous experience 
due to these factors  and because of the tropical acquisition  a comparison of unfilled orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments 
supply of products and quality control we currently use independent contract manufacturers to supply the substantial majority of the products we sell 
of the total dollar value of sourced products in fiscal  was sourced from suppliers in asia  was sourced from suppliers in south and central america  was sourced from suppliers in the middle east and was sourced from suppliers in other areas of the world  respectively 
we believe that the use of numerous independent contract manufacturers allows us to maximize production flexibility  while avoiding significant capital expenditures  work in process inventory build ups and the costs of maintaining and operating production facilities 
we have had relationships with some suppliers for as long as years  however  none of these relationships are formal or require either party to purchase or supply any fixed quantity of product 
the vast majority of our non swimwear products are purchased as full packages  where we place an order with the supplier and the supplier purchases all the raw materials  assembles the garments and ships them to our distribution facilities or third party facilities 
for a small portion of our swimwear business and a portion of the tropical business  we purchase fabric from domestic and international suppliers 
we utilize sewing contractors located primarily in mexico and the caribbean basin enabling us to utilize exemptions under customs regulations  which provide that certain articles assembled abroad from united states components are exempt from united states duties on the value of those components 
this process is generally referred to as cmt cut  make and trim and differs from full package sourcing in that we  not the supplier  purchase and own the fabric and trim components 
as of january   we had shifted the vast majority of our swimwear business to a full package model and anticipate shifting an increasing percentage of the tropical business to this sourcing model 
finished goods are generally shipped to either our distribution facilities or to third party facilities around the united states for repackaging and distribution to customers 
we maintain a staff of experienced sourcing professionals in five offices in china including hong kong  as well as the united states  south korea  taiwan  vietnam and the dominican republic 
this staff sources our products worldwide  monitors our suppliers purchases of raw material  and monitors production at contract manufacturing facilities in order to ensure quality control and timely delivery 
we also operate through independent agents in asia and the middle east 
our personnel based in our miami  florida office perform similar functions with respect to our suppliers in central america 
we conduct inspections of samples of each product prior to cutting by contractors during the manufacturing process and prior to shipment 
we also have full time quality assurance inspectors in latin america and the caribbean and in each of our overseas offices 
we also generally facilitate and aid our foreign contractors in obtaining raw materials 
generally  the foreign contractors purchase the raw material in accordance with our specifications 
raw materials  which are in most instances made and or colored especially for us  consist principally of piece goods and yarn and are specified by us from a number of foreign and domestic textile mills and converters 
we are committed to ethical sourcing standards and require our independent contractors to comply with our code of conduct 
we monitor compliance by our foreign contract manufacturers with applicable laws and regulations relating to  for example  the payment of wages  working conditions and the environment 
as part of our compliance program  we maintain compliance departments in the united states and overseas and routinely perform audits of our contract manufacturers and require corrective action when appropriate 
our relationship with our foreign suppliers subjects us to the risks of doing business abroad 
as a result of our suppliers  in some instances  being at great geographic distances from us  our transportation costs are increased and longer lead times are required  which reduces our flexibility 
our finished goods are also subject to import duties  quotas and other restrictions 
the countries that we source our products from may  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs  or other restrictions or adjust prevailing quota  duty or tariff levels  which could affect our ability to import products at the current or increased levels 
other risks in doing business with foreign suppliers include political or economic instability  any significant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies  terrorist activities  and restrictions on the transfer of funds 
although we have not been affected in a material way by any of the foregoing factors  we cannot predict the likelihood or frequency of any such events occurring and any material disruption may have an adverse affect on our business 

table of contents import and import restrictions our import operations are subject to constraints imposed by bilateral textile agreements between the united states and a number of foreign countries 
these agreements impose quotas on the amount and type of goods that can be imported into the united states from these countries 
these agreements also allow the united states to impose  at any time  restraints on importing certain categories of products that  under the terms of the agreements  are not subject to specified limits 
most of our imported products are also subject to united states customs duties and other charges 
we closely monitor developments in quotas  duties  and tariffs and continually seek to minimize our exposure to these risks through  among other things  geographical diversification of our contract manufacturers  maintaining our overseas offices  allocating overseas production to product categories where more quota is available  and shifting of production among countries and manufacturers 
under the terms of the world trade organization agreement on textiles and clothing  wto members removed all quotas effective january   and the current environment over textile quotas is rapidly changing 
because of our sourcing experience  capabilities and relationships  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the changing textile and apparel quota environment 
competition the apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
our competitors include numerous apparel designers  manufacturers  importers  licensors  and our own customers private label programs  many of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than we have available to us 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the industry are brand name and brand identity  timeliness  reliability and quality of services provided  market share and visibility  price  and the ability to anticipate customer and consumer demands and maintain appeal of products to customers 
we strive to focus on these points and have proven our ability to anticipate and respond quickly to customer demands with our brands  range of products and our ability to operate within the industry s production and delivery constraints 
we believe that our continued dedication to customer service  product assortment and quality control  as well as our aggressive pursuit of licensing and acquisition opportunities  directly addresses the competitive factors in all market segments 
our established brands and relationships with retailers have resulted in a loyal following of customers 
we understand that the level of competition and the nature of our competitors vary by product segment 
in particular  in the mass market channel  manufacturers constitute our main competitors in this less expensive segment of the market  while high profile domestic and foreign designers and licensors account for our main competitors in the more upscale segment of the market 
although we have been able to compete successfully to date  there can be no assurance that significant new competitors will not develop in the future 
trademarks our material trademarks are registered with the united states patent and trademark office and in other countries 
we regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets that are critical in the marketing of our products  and  therefore  we vigorously protect our trademarks against infringements 
employees as of april   subsequent to the tropical acquisition  we had approximately  employees compared to approximately  employees as of april  some of our employees at our winnsboro  south carolina distribution facility are subject to a collective bargaining agreement  which expires in august none of our other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory 

table of contents certain risks our business faces certain risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business 
if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below or elsewhere in this report actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we rely on a few key customers  and a significant decrease in business from or the loss of any one key customer would substantially reduce our revenues and harm our business 
we derive a significant amount of our revenues from a few major customers 
for example  net sales to our five largest customers totaled approximately   and of net sales during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
our five largest customers in fiscal were kohl s  j 
c 
penney  dillard s  sears and wal mart but no customer accounted for more than of our net sales 
kohl s represented of our net sales during fiscal and wal mart accounted for approximately of net sales during fiscal no other single customer accounted for more than of our net sales during fiscal and a significant decrease in business from or loss of any of our major customers could harm our financial condition by causing a significant decline in revenues attributable to such customers 
although we have long standing relationships with many of our customers  we do not have long term contracts with any of them and purchases generally occur on an order by order basis 
we believe that purchasing decisions are generally made independently by individual department stores within a company controlled group 
there has been a trend  however  toward more centralized purchasing decisions 
as such decisions become more centralized  the risk to us of such concentration increases 
furthermore  our customers could curtail or cease their business with us because of changes in their strategic and operational initiatives  such as an increased focus on private label  consolidation with another retailer eg the sears and k mart merger  and the proposed acquisition of may by federated  changes in our customer s buying patterns  financial instability and other reasons 
if the proposed acquisition of may by federated is consummated  we anticipate that the combined group would represent in excess of of our fiscal net sales 
if our customers curtail or cease business with us  our revenues could significantly decrease and our financial condition could be significantly harmed 
we may not be able to anticipate consumer preferences and fashion trends  which could negatively affect acceptance of our products by retailers and consumers and result in a significant decrease in net sales 
our failure to anticipate  identify and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends could adversely affect acceptance of our products by retailers and consumers and may result in a significant decrease in net sales or leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory 
we believe that our success depends on our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to changing fashion trends in a timely manner 
our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change 
we may not be able to continue to develop appealing styles or successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands in the future 
in addition  any new products or brands that we introduce may not be successfully received by retailers and consumers 
due to the fact that we began marketing women s apparel with the acquisition of the jantzen swimwear business in fiscal  we may be more subject to additional changes in fashion trends as women s fashion trends have historically changed more rapidly than men s 
if our products are not successfully received by retailers and consumers and we are left with a substantial amount of unsold inventory  we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess  slow moving inventory 
if this occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects may be harmed 
our business could be adversely impacted if our swimwear business continues to remain unprofitable 
furthermore  our swimwear results could be adversely affected by several factors outside of our control 
we acquired the jantzen swimwear business in march and the business has yet to be profitable 
there can be no assurances that the business will be profitable in the future 
our future results may be adversely impacted if this business remains unprofitable 
furthermore  there are several factors which could impact the financial performance of the swimwear business  such as the highly seasonal nature of the business where the vast majority of swimwear shipments to our customers occur in our first and fourth quarters  adverse weather  temporary disruptions in the supply chain and other factors 

table of contents we are dependent upon the revenues generated by our licensing alliances and the loss or inability to renew certain licenses could reduce our royalty income or net sales and consequently reduce our net income 
a portion of our net income is derived from licensing income received from our licensing partners 
the interruption of the business of several of our licensing partners at any one time could adversely affect our royalty income and net income 
licensing income accounted for million or of total revenues for fiscal we currently license the ping  nike  tommy hilfiger  and ocean pacific brands from third parties  although the tommy hilfiger and ocean pacific licenses expire in these licenses vary in length of term  renewal conditions and royalty obligations 
the average term of these licenses is three to five years with automatic renewals depending upon whether we achieve certain targeted sales goals 
we may not be able to renew or extend any of these licenses  on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to renew or extend any of these licenses  we could experience a decrease in net sales 
our business could be harmed if we do not deliver quality products in a timely manner 
our sourcing  logistics and technology functions operate within substantial production and delivery requirements and subjects us to the risks associated with unaffiliated manufacturers  transportation and other risks 
if we do not comply with customer product requirements or meet their delivery requirements  our customers could reduce our selling prices  require significant margin support  reduce the amount of business they do with us  or cease to do business with us  all of which would harm our business 
we may face challenges integrating the tropical acquisition business or any other businesses we may acquire  which may negatively impact our business 
as part of our strategy of making selective acquisitions  we acquire new brands and product categories 
these and future acquisitions have inherent risks  including the risk that the projected sales and net income from the acquisition may not be generated  the risk that the integration is more costly and takes longer than anticipated  risks of retaining key personnel  and risks associated with unanticipated events and unknown legal liabilities 
any of these and other risks may harm our business 
we will need to integrate tropical s business into our operations in order to achieve the anticipated benefits of the tropical acquisition 
we face many challenges in consolidating functions and integrating management procedures  personnel and operations in an efficient and effective manner  which if not managed as projected  may negatively impact our business 
some of these challenges include increased demands on management related to the significant increase in the size and diversity of our business after the tropical acquisition  the dedication of management s attention to implement our strategies for the tropical business  the retention and integration of key tropical employees  determining aspects of tropical s business that are to be kept separate and distinct from our other businesses  and difficulties in assimilating tropical s corporate culture and practices into ours 
we have a significant amount of debt  which could have important negative consequences to us  including making it difficult for us to satisfy all of our obligations in the event we experience financial difficulties 
we have a significant amount of debt 
as of january  we had million of debt outstanding excluding amounts outstanding under our letter of credit facilities 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our senior secured notes and our senior subordinated notes  including our ability to repurchase such notes upon the occurrence of a change of control  increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and adverse changes in governmental regulations  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  
table of contents limiting the rights of our holders of senior subordinated notes to receive payments if holders of our secured debt have not been paid  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors 
our ability to pay interest on our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon  among other things  our future operating performance and cash flow and our ability to refinance indebtedness when necessary 
each of these factors is  to a large extent  dependent on general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
if  in the future  we cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness or to meet our liquidity needs or other obligations  we will need to refinance our existing debt  obtain additional financing or sell assets 
we cannot assure that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  our interest expense may increase if general economic conditions result in an increasing interest rate environment because most of our debt is based on variable as opposed to fixed rates 
we cannot assure that our business will generate cash flow  or that we will be able to obtain funding  sufficient to satisfy our debt service requirements 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry and our failure to successfully compete could result in a loss of one or more significant customers 
the apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
our competitors include numerous apparel designers  manufacturers  importers and licensors  many of which have greater financial and marketing resources than us 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are brand name and brand identity  timeliness  reliability and quality of services provided  market share and visibility  price  and the ability to anticipate customer and consumer demands and maintain appeal of products to customers 
the level of competition and the nature of our competitors varies by product segment with low margin  mass market manufacturers being our main competitors in the less expensive segment of the market and us and foreign designers and licensors competing with us in the more upscale segment of the market 
if we do not maintain our brand names and identities and continue to provide high quality and reliable services on a timely basis at competitive prices  we may not be able to continue to compete in our industry 
if we are unable to compete successfully  we could lose one or more of our significant customers  which  if not replaced  could negatively impact our sales and financial performance 
we depend on certain key personnel the loss of which could negatively impact our ability to manage our business 
our future success depends to a significant extent on retaining the services of certain executive officers and directors  in particular george feldenkreis  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and oscar feldenkreis  our president and chief operating officer 
they are each party to an employment agreement  which was renewed in december for an additional two year period expiring in may  although we expect to enter into new employment agreements in the near future 
the loss of the services of either george feldenkreis or oscar feldenkreis  or any other key member of management  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business 
our continued success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  administrative and sales personnel to support our future growth 
our inability to do so may have a significant negative impact on our ability to manage our business 
item properties we own our principal executive and administrative office  warehouse and distribution facility  which is located in a  square foot facility in miami  florida

over time we expanded our product line to offer a variety of men s sport shirts 
in  we developed the natural issue brand and completed our initial public offering in in  we began an expansion strategy through the acquisition of brands including the munsingwear family of brands in  the john henry and manhattan brands from perry ellis menswear in and the perry ellis brand in following the perry ellis acquisition  we changed our name from supreme international corporation to perry ellis international  inc to better reflect the name recognition that the brand provided 
in  we acquired the jantzen brand and in june we acquired perry ellis menswear  our largest licensee  giving us greater control of the perry ellis brand  as well as adding other brands owned by perry ellis menswear 
subsequent to fiscal  on february   we completed the tropical acquisition  making us one of the largest supplier s of bottoms in the united states 
we are one of the leading apparel companies in the united states 
we control a portfolio of major men s and women s brands  some of which were established over years ago 
we design  source  market and license our products nationally and internationally at multiple price points and across all major levels of retail distribution through up to  doors 
our portfolio of highly recognized brands includes perry ellis and perry ellis america  which we believe together generate over billion in annual retail sales  axis  tricots st 
raphael  jantzen  john henry  cubavera  the havanera co  natural issue  munsingwear  grand slam  original penguin  mondo di marco  redsand  pro player  manhattan  savane and farah 
we also i license the nike and tommy hilfiger brands for swimwear and swimwear accessories  ii are the worldwide master licensee for ping golf apparel  iii license the ocean pacific brand for certain men s sportswear categories  and v license the pga tour brand for golf apparel 
we distribute our products primarily to wholesale customers that represent all major levels of retail distribution including department stores  national and regional chain stores  mass merchants  specialty stores  sporting goods stores  green grass golf shops  the corporate incentive market as well as clubs and independent retailers in the united states and canada 
our largest customers include federated department stores  inc  dillard s inc  the may department stores company  wal mart stores  inc  jc penney company  kohl s 
table of contents corporation  and sears 
we also operate retail stores located primarily in upscale retail outlet malls across the united states 
in addition  we leverage our design  sourcing and logistics expertise by offering a limited number of private label programs to retailers 
in order to maximize the worldwide exposure of our brands and generate high margin royalty income  we license our brands through approximately domestic and approximately international license agreements 
our wholesale business  which is comprised of men s sportswear and women s and men s swimwear and swimwear accessories  accounted for of our total revenues in fiscal  and our licensing business accounted for of our total revenues in fiscal we have traditionally focused on the men s sportswear market  which represented approximately of our total wholesale revenues in fiscal  while our women s and men s swimwear market represented approximately of our total wholesale revenues in fiscal our licensing business is a significant contributor to our operating income 
we license the brands we own to third parties for the manufacturing and marketing of various products in distribution channels and countries in which we do not distribute those brands  including men s and women s footwear  men s suits  underwear  loungewear  outerwear  fragrances  eyewear and accessories 
these licensing arrangements raise the overall awareness of our brands without requiring us to make capital investments or incur additional operating expenses 
subsequent to fiscal  on february   we acquired certain domestic operating assets of tropical sportswear int l corporation and its subsidiaries and tropical s united kingdom subsidiary 
tropical was a leading designer  marketer and distributor of men s branded and private label bottoms to all channels of distribution 
with the tropical acquisition  we believe we have become one of the largest suppliers of men s bottoms in the united states  added significant revenues  further strengthened and balanced our product mix  and added to our portfolio of brands 
the tropical acquisition also provides us with a state of the art distribution facility in tampa  florida and a strong platform to expand our existing brands into europe as a result of the acquired uk subsidiary 
our products have historically been geared towards lighter weight apparel generally worn during the spring and summer months 
we believe that this seasonality has been reduced with our introduction of fall  winter  and holiday merchandise 
our swimwear business  however  is highly seasonal in nature  with the significant majority of its sales occurring in our first and fourth quarters 
our higher priced products generally tend to be less sensitive to either economic or weather conditions 
seasonality can be affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of advance and fill in orders  the amount of sales to different distribution channels  and overall product mix among traditional merchandise  fashion merchandise and swimwear 
we expect that revenues for our second quarter will typically be lower than our other quarters due to the impact of seasonal sales 
we believe that our future growth will come as a result of our recently completed tropical acquisition  as well as through organic growth from our continued emphasis on our existing brands  new and expanded product lines  domestic and international licensing opportunities  and selective acquisitions and opportunities that fit strategically with our business model 
our future results may be impacted by risks and trends set forth in item business certain risks and elsewhere in this report
