overview we are engaged in the development  manufacture  sale and service of systems for genetic analysis for use in the life sciences and in clinical diagnostics 
our industry is affected by a number of factors that influence its size and development 
these factors include the availability of genomic sequence data for human and other organisms  technological innovation that increases throughput and lowers the cost of genomic and genetic analysis  the development of new computational techniques to handle and analyze large amounts of genomic data  the availability of government funding for basic and disease related research  the amount of capital and ongoing expenditures allocated to research and development spending by biotechnology  pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies  the application of genomics to new areas including molecular diagnostics  agriculture  human identity and consumer goods  and the availability of genetic markers and signatures of diagnostic value 
we have established our genechip system as the platform of choice for acquiring  analyzing and managing complex genetic information 
our integrated genechip platform includes disposable dna probe arrays chips consisting of gene sequences set out in an ordered  high density pattern  certain reagents for use with the probe arrays  a scanner and other instruments used to process the probe arrays  and software to analyze and manage genomic information obtained from the probe arrays 
we currently sell our products directly to pharmaceutical  biotechnology  agrichemical  diagnostics and consumer products companies as well as academic research centers  government research laboratories  private foundation laboratories and clinical reference laboratories in north america and europe 
we also sell our products through life science supply specialists acting as authorized distributors in mexico  india  the middle east and asia pacific regions 
we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations in the past  but have now achieved profitability for two consecutive fiscal years 
the following overview describes key elements of our business strategy and our goals for fiscal continue to develop and expand sales of our genechip system 
we intend to continue to enhance our genechip technology through substantial investments in research and development and collaborations 
as we continue to enhance the functionality and decrease the unit costs of our genechip products  we aim to encourage our customers to expand their research uses for our genechip system  which will create new market opportunities for us 
our goal is to achieve solid growth in probe arrays and reagent sales as a result of expanding our product lines and adding new customers 
while we anticipate instrument revenue to be up slightly as compared to due to continued revenue growth related to sales of new instruments and automation equipment  this growth will be partially offset by the eventual completion of our instrument upgrade cycle  and our largest opportunity for growth will likely be through sales of our genechip products 
leverage our technologies into new markets 
a key driver will be increasing the breadth of scientific and diagnostic applications of our technology  while also industrializing  automating and standardizing our technology to open new markets and drive revenue growth 
the aim of our automation efforts is to reduce the cost per experiment  minimize operator variability and dramatically improve experimental throughput 
we believe that our high throughput automation solutions will enjoy the same success as our bench top systems have in the research markets 
we have several active collaborations aimed at extending our existing technologies and products into diagnostic applications and we continue to look for new applications for our technology  new collaborative opportunities and new markets 
maintain our operating margins 
management is focused on growing the business and increasing its operating profitability at the same time 
in addition to the revenue growth opportunities described above  we seek to achieve continued leverage in our manufacturing costs and operating expenses 
our goal has been and continues to be to grow our operating expenses at about half the rate of our product and product related revenue growth 
if we are able to contain the growth rate of our operating expenses  we should be able to continue our recent trend of profitability 
critical accounting policies estimates general the following section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain accounting policies are particularly important to the reporting of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into contracts to sell our products and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements  when to recognize revenue for each element  and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and customer acceptance has occurred 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered to undelivered elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
accounts receivable we evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze our significant customer accounts  and  when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record specific bad debt reserves to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also record reserves for bad debt on a small portion of all other customer balances based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  macroeconomic considerations and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventories we enter into inventory purchases and commitments so that we can meet future shipment schedules based on forecasted demand for our products 
the business environment in which we operate is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory each period  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  product expiration and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete or impaired goods  when appropriate  in order to report inventory at net realizable value 
revisions to our inventory adjustments may be required if actual demand  component costs  supplier arrangements  or product life cycles differ from our estimates 
nonmarketable equity securities as part of our strategic efforts to gain access to potential new products and technologies  we invest in equity securities of certain private biotechnology companies 
our nonmarketable equity securities are carried at cost unless we determine that an impairment that is other than temporary has occurred  in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value 
we periodically review our investments for impairment  however  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment in identifying events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
the analysis may include assessment of the investee s i revenue and earnings trend  ii business outlook for its products and technologies  iii liquidity position and the rate at which it is using its cash  and iv likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying value  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we have experienced impairments in our portfolio due to the decline in equity markets over the past few years 
however  we are not able to determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future  or the extent or timing of the individual impairments 
deferred taxes income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we must then assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations 
we believe that our estimates are reasonable and that our reserves for income tax related uncertainties are adequate 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  future levels of research and development spending  and changes in overall levels and mix of pretax earnings 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings principally related to intellectual property matters 
based on the information available at the balance sheet dates  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a reserve in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
any reserves recorded may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than july  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company expects to adopt statement r effective july  under the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend  in part  on the levels of share based payments granted prior to the date of adoption 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in for such excess tax deductions was million in results of operations f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
in january  we expanded our collaboration with roche by granting roche access to our genechip technologies to develop and commercialize genechip diagnostic laboratory tests for dna analysis  genotyping and resequencing applications  as well as for rna expression analysis  in a broad range of human disease areas 
using our genechip technologies  roche is seeking to develop and market diagnostic tests for diseases such as cancer  osteoporosis  cardiovascular  metabolic  infectious and inflammatory diseases 
under the terms of the collaborative agreement  roche paid us an up front  nonrefundable license fee of million 
we are recognizing this amount as a component of product related revenue over the research and product development phase which is expected to approximate five years 
the agreement  which is subject to roche s option to terminate on december  or any time on or after june   with one year s prior notice  includes a broad range of other compensation payable by roche to us throughout the life of the agreement based on minimum annual royalties on sales of diagnostic kits  milestone payments for technical and commercial achievements  a manufacturing and supply agreement  and related license installments 
perlegen sciences  inc on january   we entered into an agreement with perlegen  a related party  to in license certain intangible assets that are expected to accelerate our plans to design and commercialize affymetrix microarrays for whole genome and candidate region dna analysis 
in addition to broadening our access to certain specific perlegen technologies  this licensing agreement advanced by approximately three years our prior commercialization rights to the perlegen single nucleotide polymorphism snp database for the development of affymetrix microarray dna products that we already had under development prior to january this agreement also eliminated any future royalty obligations for array products that we commercialize based on information contained in perlegen s snp database 
under the terms of the licensing agreement  we paid perlegen a total of million in cash and granted perlegen a million credit to be applied against the margin on our future sales of chips to perlegen 
the million of cash consideration in this transaction was allocated to the following intangible asset categories based upon their relative estimated fair values the advancement by three years of our access to the perlegen single nucleotide polymorphism snp database  which allowed us to substantially accelerate our ongoing development of a limited number of dna analysis products  various licenses or modification of existing licenses for several perlegen technologies which provided us benefits across a larger number of our microarray products  we engaged an independent third party valuation professional to assist us in determining the relative fair values of each intangible asset licensed and the allocation of the consideration paid 
while we considered the work of the independent third party valuation professional  we took primary responsibility for allocating the consideration paid for the intangible assets acquired 
in connection with the advanced access to the perlegen snp database  we recorded a charge of approximately million related to the license in the remaining million was recorded as intangible assets which are being amortized over their useful lives of six to ten years 
the following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the years ended december   and product sales the components of product sales are as follows in thousands year ended december  dollar change from probe arrays     reagents      instruments      total product sales     total product sales increased or million in as compared to the increase in genechip probe arrays was primarily due to growth of million related to increased unit sales of our genechip probe arrays which was partially offset by a decrease of million related to a decline in the average selling price of our probe arrays due to a change in product mix 
the increase in unit sales of our probe arrays is primarily the result of new product introductions 
reagent sales increased million primarily due to increased probe array sales and continued market acceptance of our new internally manufactured reagents 
the improvement in instrument sales is primarily due to growth of million related to increased unit sales of our genechip scanner instruments and upgrades  growth of million related to increased unit sales of full genechip instrumentation systems including our new gcs dx system  and growth of million related to an increase in the average selling price of our instruments due to a change in product mix 
total product sales increased or million in as compared to the increase was primarily due to growth in instrument revenue 
the new genechip scanner and genechip fluidics station  which were launched in the first half of fiscal year  contributed million to the increase in instrument revenue 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease related to a decline in unit sales of our full genechip instrument systems 
reagents increased million during the year as a result of growth in unit sales due to our expanded product offering and overall increased product acceptance 
overall  both the average selling price and the number of units of our genechip probe arrays remained relatively consistent with those in  with the inclusion of the transition of our flagship human chip product from a two chip set to one chip 
product related revenue the components of product related revenue are as follows in thousands year ended december  dollar change from subscription fees      service and other      license fees and milestone revenue    total product related revenue     total product related revenue decreased or million in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to a million decline in subscription fees earned under genechip array access programs as we continue to transition customers to volume based discounting on product sales 
in addition  service and other revenue declined million primarily due to a million decline in service contract revenue due to a decrease in the number of contracts as pre existing scanner customers upgraded to our genechip scanner which is covered by a one year warranty 
these decreases were partially offset by an additional million of license fees earned from a full year of amortization of the roche agreement and the recognition of million in milestone revenue due to the achievement of substantive at risk goals as defined by our collaborative agreements 
license fees and milestone revenue earned in connection with the roche agreement was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  total product related revenue increased or million in as compared to the increase in product related revenue for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in license fees of million earned in connection with the roche agreement signed in january  an increase in service revenue of million associated with the continued growth in our installed base of equipment and the inclusion of custom probe array design fees of million in as a result of the full commercialization of our custom product offering 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in software revenue and a decrease of million in subscription fees earned under genechip array access programs as we transition customers to volume based discounting on product sales 
revenues from custom probe array design fees of million are reported in royalties and other revenue in royalty and other revenue in thousands year ended december  dollar change from royalties and other revenue    royalties and other revenue decreased or million in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decline in the number and average value of our remaining non core license agreements 
royalty and other revenue decreased or million in as compared to the decline was primarily due to the reporting of million of custom probe array design fees as product related revenue beginning in january  as a result of the full commercialization of our custom product offering and due to the decline in new license agreements and royalties  as customers moved from licensing our non core spotting technology to purchasing our genechip probe arrays 
in addition  in the second quarter of  we recognized approximately million of deferred revenue related to the early completion of a long term contractual arrangement under which we had no further obligations 
the decrease was partially offset by increased research activity of million related to an existing grant 
revenue from perlegen sciences  inc 
in thousands year ended december  dollar change from revenue from perlegen sciences     revenue from perlegen sciences  a related party  decreased or million in as compared to the decline was primarily due to decreased demand by perlegen for our whole wafers 
we sell whole wafers to perlegen for use in perlegen s research and development activities at our fully burdened cost of manufacturing 
starting in the second quarter of  we began recognizing margin on the sale of probe arrays that were utilized by perlegen for revenue generating activities 
the margin earned on the sale of these probe arrays was million in revenue from the sale of wafers to perlegen  a related party  decreased or million in as compared to the decrease was consistent with the decrease in perlegen s contractual obligations under their supply agreement with us as they completed their initial genome scanning project 
pursuant to this supply agreement  we sell whole wafers to perlegen for use in perlegen s research and development activities at our fully burdened cost of manufacturing 
product and product related gross margins in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar percentage change from gross margin on product sales     gross margin on product related revenue    gross margin on product and product related revenue   product gross margin as a percentage of product sales product related gross margin as a percentage of product related revenue the gross margin percentage on product sales increased from to in as compared to of the increase in product gross margins  approximately of the increase can be attributed to an increase in probe array gross margins due to the conversion of a royalty bearing technology license from ogt to a fully paid up non royalty bearing license in the second half of the remainder of the gross margin increase can be attributed to increased utilization of our chip and instrument manufacturing facilities due to increased sales volume as well as a change in our overall product mix 
the gross margin percentage on product related revenue decreased from to in as compared to this decrease was primarily due to a decline in sales of our access agreements as we continue to transition customers to volume based discounting on product sales and due to an increase in expenses related to certain of our service agreements 
these margin decreases were partially offset by the recognition of million in milestone revenue due to the achievement of substantive at risk goals as defined by our collaborative agreements 
the gross margin percentage on product sales increased from to in as compared to this increase was primarily due to higher gross margins on instruments resulting from higher average selling prices and a lower cost of production associated with the internal manufacturing of the genechip scanner  as the company transitioned from the genearray scanner which was manufactured for us under a supply agreement 
the transition to internal manufacturing resulted in increased production volume in our bedford facility 
gross margins on probe arrays were also slightly higher in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of lower production costs per unit due to increased manufacturing efficiencies 
the gross margin percentage on product related revenue decreased from to in as compared to this decrease was primarily due to the inclusion of million in costs associated with our custom probe array design fees beginning in january as a result of the full commercialization of our custom product offering  as well as a decrease in software revenue and subscription fees earned under our access agreements 
the impact on margins from the decrease in software revenue and subscription fees were partially offset by a million increase in license revenue from the roche agreement signed in january cost of perlegen revenues in thousands year ended december  dollar change from cost of revenue from perlegen sciences    cost of perlegen revenue decreased or million in as compared to primarily due to the reduction in wafer purchases made by perlegen 
this decrease was partially offset by costs associated with perlegen s purchase of genechip instruments in the first half of cost of perlegen revenue decreased or million in as compared to due to the reduction in wafer purchases made by perlegen  which is consistent with perlegen s declining contractual purchase obligations as they completed their initial genome scanning project 
research and development expenses in thousands year ended december  dollar change from research and development     research and development expenses  which primarily consist of basic research  product research and development and manufacturing process and development increased or million in as compared to the growth was primarily due to million in increased costs associated with the expanded use of our pilot operations facility in sunnyvale for new product development 
we also increased our spending on basic research and product research and development 
research and development expenses decreased or million in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the reporting of million in costs associated with custom probe array design fees as cost of product related revenue starting in january as a result of the full commercialization of our custom product offering as well as a million decrease in consulting services 
these decreases were partially offset by other miscellaneous research and development expenses 
we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to a long term sustainable competitive advantage and critical to expansion into new markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses in thousands year ended december  dollar change from selling  general and administrative    selling  general and administrative expenses increased or million in as compared to the growth was partially due to an increase of million in sales and marketing expenses which was comprised of million related to new product introductions and increased sales volume in our american and european regions  partially offset by a decrease in sales and support costs of million in japan as our japanese operations completed their obligations associated with a prior distribution agreement 
in addition  general and administrative expenses increased by million related to on going regulatory compliance efforts and other general administrative costs 
this increase is net of million in lower legal expenses and the receipt of a cash settlement in of approximately million in connection with the resolution of an intellectual property dispute 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased or million in as compared to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to an increased investment of million in our sales and support infrastructure in japan and europe  and an increase of million in general legal expenses related to our current litigation 
these increases were partially offset by the recovery of a previously reserved million account receivable and million in decreases in general administrative costs due to company wide cost controls 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we expand sales  marketing  and technical support functions  management and administrative functions  prosecute and defend our intellectual property position and defend against claims made by third parties in ongoing litigation 
we expect legal costs to vary substantially as the intensity of legal activity changes 
there can be no assurance that we have adequately estimated our exposure for potential damages associated with pending or future litigation 
stock based compensation in thousands year ended december  dollar change from stock based compensation     stock based compensation  which primarily includes the amortization of deferred stock compensation  decreased or million in as compared to and decreased or million in as compared to upon the acquisition of neomorphic in october  the fair value of unvested common stock subject to restricted stock agreements and the intrinsic value of the unvested options held by employees were deducted from the purchase price and allocated to deferred stock compensation 
the amortization of deferred stock based compensation is principally attributable to research and development and selling  general and administrative employees 
as of december   all of the remaining deferred stock compensation related to the neomorphic acquisition has been amortized except for approximately million of deferred stock compensation related to an executive level neomorphic employee who commenced a leave of absence during the latter part of fiscal the remaining million balance will be amortized if and when the employee resumes active status with us 
amortization of purchased intangibles in thousands year ended december  dollar change from amortization of purchased intangibles  we incurred no charges related to the amortization of purchased intangibles in as we fully amortized all of our purchased intangibles during the fiscal year ended for fiscal and  the amortization of purchased intangibles represents the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of neomorphic  inc the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on january  in accordance with sfas  we reclassified million of assembled workforce to goodwill and ceased the amortization of goodwill 
we completed our review for potential impairment of goodwill as of june   and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill 
in addition  there have been no indicators of potential impairment through december  acquired in process technology in thousands year ended december  dollar change from acquired in process technology    during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of approximately million to acquired in process technology 
the associated charge was for advanced access to the perlegen snp database and was recorded as the database has no alternative future use to us beyond our developing a limited number of closely related dna analysis products 
we did not acquire any in process research projects from perlegen 
therefore  as of the license date  we did not forecast any material changes from our historical gross margins for any of our dna analysis products 
we engaged an independent third party valuation professional to assist us in determining the relative fair values of each intangible asset licensed and the allocation of the consideration paid 
while we considered the work of the independent third party valuation professional  we took primary responsibility for allocating the consideration paid for the intangible assets acquired 
we determined the value of the snp database license by using the income approach 
in applying this approach  we estimated the net present value of future cash flows expected from the sale of dna analysis products to be developed in reliance on the content from the perlegen snp database 
the analysis included forecasted future cash flows that were expected from the progress made on our dna microarray development projects prior to the date of the perlegen snp database license 
these cash flows were first estimated by forecasting total revenue associated with sales of certain of our future dna analysis products 
a portion of this revenue was then removed to account for the contribution provided by our existing core technology that was considered to benefit the dna products under development 
appropriate operating expenses  cash flow adjustments  and contributory asset returns were deducted from the estimated cash flows to establish a forecast of net cash flows 
finally  these net cash flows were converted to a present value using a discount rate of  which was based on our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the technical and market risks associated with our ongoing research project in which the snp database content would be used 
significant cash inflows from the associated dna products were forecasted to continue through the estimates used by us in valuing the licensed technologies were based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
interest income and other  net in thousands year ended december  dollar change from interest income and other  net     interest income and other  net decreased or million in as compared to the decrease in interest income and other  net was primarily due to the recognition of a million gain in on an equity investment in a privately held biotechnology company following its acquisition by a publicly traded entity and a million gain realized in on the sale of some of our perlegen stock 
in  we also realized currency gains of million prior to the date we began hedging a percentage of our assets in that are held in various foreign currencies of our subsidiaries with forward contracts  with the gains or losses on these contracts largely offsetting gains and losses on the change in value of the underlying assets 
interest income declined million in due to lower cash and marketable securities balances following the million of bond redemptions completed in the first quarter of and a million license payment to ogt in the second quarter of finally  we realized impairment charges of million in due to other than temporary declines in the carrying values of certain non marketable equity securities 
interest income and other  net increased by or million in as compared to the increase in interest income and other  net was primarily due to the million gain realized on the sale of some of our perlegen stock  along with the acquisition by a publicly traded entity in april of a privately held biotechnology company in which we owned an equity investment 
consistent with emerging issues task force  nonmonetary exchange of cost method investments  we realized a million gain on the acquisition date and recognized an additional gain of million upon the subsequent sale of a portion of these securities 
this was partially offset by a decrease in interest income as a result of a lower average balance in our marketable securities account  lower returns on our cash and marketable securities portfolio and by a million realized loss related to an other than temporary write down of our investment in a venture capital limited partnership 
in  we also recorded a million write down related to an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in orchid biosciences  inc and had a million realized loss related to an other than temporary write down of our investment in a venture capital limited partnership 
interest expense in thousands year ended december  dollar change from interest expense      interest expense decreased or million in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to lower interest charges following the million of bond redemptions completed in the first quarter of of our and convertible subordinated notes 
this decrease was primarily offset by million of charges incurred in connection with the bond redemptions 
in addition  the decrease was also offset by million in interest expense and the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the million of senior convertible notes issued in december interest expense decreased or million in as compared to the decrease occurred primarily because in the second quarter of fiscal we repurchased million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due in  and million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due in income tax provision in thousands for the years ended december  dollar change from income tax provision    the provision for income tax was approximately million in  up from million in in  the provision principally consists of taxes currently payable on the taxable profits generated by our foreign operations  federal alternative minimum tax  and state taxes 
the provision for income tax was approximately million in  up from million in in  the provision consists of current taxes accrued on the profits attributable to our foreign operations  state taxes and federal alternative minimum tax 
in  the provision consists of current taxes accrued on the profits attributable to our foreign operations and state taxes 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes the historical operating performance and the reported net losses through december   at december   we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had tax effected net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire at various dates in through  if not utilized 
in addition  we have federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million  which expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code 
we believe the effect of such limitations will not result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
we anticipate our effective tax rate will increase in future years as we continue to generate profits 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cashflow in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in provided by investing activities   net cash used in provided by financing activities   effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents  net cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by increases in our net income 
however  operating cash flows differ from net income as a result of non cash charges or differences in the timing of cash flows and earnings recognition 
significant components of the change in cash provided by operating activities are as follows deferred revenues declined million during compared to an increase of million in deferred revenues increased million during compared to a decrease of million in the increase in was primarily due to the million roche collaboration agreement up front  nonrefundable license fee received in january up front payments from collaborators are recognized in earnings over various numbers of years depending on the contractual arrangement 
refer to our revenue recognition policy above for further information 
our accounts receivable  including amounts owed from perlegen  were million at december   an increase of million from december  the increase in our accounts receivable was primarily due to the timing of our sales and higher sales of our new and existing products 
our accounts receivables was million at december   an increase of million from december  the increase was primarily due to the timing of our sales

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any spe transactions 
the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows in thousands total after senior convertible notes   interest on senior convertible notes   operating leases      purchase commitments    other commitments     total contractual obligations     our senior convertible notes are due in  however holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on december      and purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on affymetrix and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
other commitments relate to an ongoing obligation held by the company to contribute million in a venture capital limited partnership 
the venture capital limited partnership may call in this amount  in part or in full at any time according to the contract terms 
other commitments also include a funding obligation related to a research and development agreement which expires in and funding to support two fellowships under the bio x program at stanford 
we have financed our operations primarily through product sales  sales of equity and debt securities  collaborative agreements  interest income  and licensing of our technology 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities of approximately million 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources along with the cash to be generated from operations will enable us to maintain currently planned operations and planned capital expenditures estimated to be approximately million for the year ending december   for the foreseeable future 
however  this expectation is based on our current operating  financing and capital expenditure plans  which are subject to change  and therefore we could require additional funding 
we also expect that our capital requirements will increase over the next several years as we expand our worldwide commercial operations  expand our manufacturing capabilities  increase our investments in third parties and expand our research and development efforts 
our long term capital expenditure requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the expansion of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  our ability to maintain existing collaborative and customer arrangements and establish and maintain new collaborative and customer arrangements  the progress of our research and development programs  initiation or expansion of research programs and collaborations  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  the purchase of patent licenses  and other factors 
as of december   we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
our inability to raise capital would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors this form k contains forward looking information based on our current expectations 
because our actual results may differ materially from any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of affymetrix  this section includes a discussion of important risk factors that could affect our actual future results 
we have only recently achieved profitability 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million 
prior to the year ended december   we incurred losses each year since our inception  and as a result have an accumulated deficit of approximately million at december  we expect to continue experiencing fluctuations in our operating results and cannot assure sustained profitability 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development  manufacturing and from selling  general and administrative costs associated with our operations  including the costs of patent related litigation 
our ability to generate significant revenues and maintain profitability is dependent in large part on our ability to expand our customer base  increase sales of our current products to existing customers  manage our expense growth  and enter into additional supply  license and collaborative arrangements as well as on our ability and that of our collaborative partners to successfully manufacture and commercialize products incorporating our technologies in new applications and in new markets 
our quarterly results have historically fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate unpredictably  which could cause our stock price to decrease 
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly due in part to factors that are beyond our control and which we cannot predict 
the timing of our customers orders may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
however  we have historically experienced customer ordering patterns for genechip instrumentation and genechip arrays where the majority of the shipments occur in the last month of the quarter 
these ordering patterns may limit management s ability to accurately forecast our future revenues 
because our expenses are largely fixed in the short to medium term  any material shortfall in revenues will materially reduce our profitability and may cause us to experience losses 
in particular  our revenue growth and profitability depend on sales of our genechip products 
factors that could cause sales for these products to fluctuate include our inability to produce products in sufficient quantities and with appropriate quality  the loss of or reduction in orders from key customers  the frequency of experiments conducted by our customers  our customers inventory of genechip products  the receipt of relatively large orders with short lead times  and our customers expectations as to how long it takes us to fill future orders 
some additional factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include weakness in the global economy and changing market conditions  general economic conditions affecting our target customers  changes in the amounts or timing of government funding to companies and research institutions  changes in the attitude of the pharmaceutical industry towards the use of genetic information and genetic testing as a methodology for drug discovery and development  and changes in the competitive landscape 
our business depends on research and development spending levels for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and governmental research institutions 
we expect that our revenues in the foreseeable future will be derived primarily from products and services provided to a relatively small number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic  governmental and other research institutions 
our success will depend upon their demand for and use of our products and services 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by these customers 
for example  reductions in capital expenditures by these customers may result in lower than expected instrumentation sales and similarly  reductions in operating expenditures by these customers could result in lower than expected genechip array sales 
these reductions and delays may result from factors that are not within our control  such as changes in economic conditions  changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions  changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences companies and life sciences research  market driven pressures on companies to consolidate and reduce costs  and other factors affecting research and development spending 
we may lose customers if we are unable to manufacture our products and ensure their proper performance and quality 
we produce our genechip products in an innovative and complicated manufacturing process which has the potential for significant variability in manufacturing yields 
we have encountered and may in the future encounter difficulties in manufacturing our products and  due to the complexity of our products and our manufacturing process  we cannot be sure we fully understand all of the factors that affect our manufacturing processes or product performance 
manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facility and launch new products 
as a result  we may experience difficulties in meeting customer  collaborator and internal demand  in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions  and demand for our products could decline 
although we rely on internal quality control procedures to verify our manufacturing process  due to the complexity of our products and manufacturing process  it is possible that probe arrays that do not meet all of our performance specifications may not be identified before they are shipped 
if our products do not consistently meet our customers performance expectations  demand for our products will decline 
in addition  we do not maintain any backup manufacturing capabilities for the production of our genechip instruments 
any interruption in our ability to continue operations at our existing manufacturing facilities could delay our ability to develop or sell our products  which could result in lost revenue and seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to deliver acceptable products to our customers due to the rapidly evolving nature of genetic sequence information upon which our products are based 
the genetic sequence information upon which we rely to develop and manufacture our products is contained in a variety of public databases throughout the world 
these genetic sequence databases are rapidly expanding and evolving 
in addition  the accuracy of such databases and resulting genetic research is dependent on various scientific interpretations and it is not expected that global genetic research efforts will result in standardized genetic sequence databases for particular genomes in the near future 
although we have implemented ongoing internal quality control efforts to help ensure the quality and accuracy of our products  the fundamental nature of our products requires us to rely on genetic sequence databases and scientific interpretations which are continuously evolving 
as a result  these variables may cause us to develop and manufacture products that incorporate sequence errors or ambiguities 
the magnitude and importance of these errors depends on multiple and complex factors that would be considered in determining the appropriate actions required to remedy any inaccuracies 
our inability to timely deliver acceptable products as a result of these factors would likely adversely affect our relationship with customers  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success in penetrating emerging market opportunities in molecular diagnostics depends on the ability of our genechip technologies to be used in clinical applications for diagnosing and informing the treatment of disease 
the clinical applications of genechip technologies for diagnosing and informing the treatment of disease is an emerging market opportunity in molecular diagnostics that seeks to improve the effectiveness of health care by collecting information about dna variation and rna expression in patients at various times from diagnosis through prognosis and on to the end of therapy 
however  there can be no assurances that molecular diagnostic markets will develop as quickly as we expect or reach what we believe is their full potential 
although we believe that there will be clinical applications of our genechip technologies that will be utilized for diagnosing and informing the treatment of disease  there can be no certainty of the technical or commercial success our technologies will achieve in such markets 
the molecular diagnostic market is relatively new for us and presents us with new risks and uncertainties 
our success in this area depends to a large extent on our collaborative relationships and the ability of our collaborative partners to successfully market and sell products using our genechip technologies 
as a result  we are also dependent on the ability of our collaborative partners to achieve regulatory approval for such products in the united states and in overseas markets 
although roche received fda approval of the first diagnostic genotyping test for use with our genechip system dx in late  there can be no assurance that other products using our genechip technologies will achieve needed approvals 
we may not successfully obtain regulatory approval of any diagnostic or other product which we or our collaborative partners develop 
the united states food and drug administration must approve certain in vitro diagnostic products before they can be marketed in the us certain in vitro diagnostic products must also be approved by the regulatory agencies of foreign governments or jurisdictions before the product can be sold outside the us commercialization of in vitro diagnostic products outside of the research environment that we or our collaborators may develop  may depend upon successful completion of clinical trials 
clinical development is a long  expensive and an uncertain process and we do not know whether we  or any of our collaborative partners  will be permitted to undertake clinical trials of any potential in vitro diagnostic products 
it may take us or our collaborative partners many years to complete any such testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
delays or rejections of potential products may be encountered based on changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review 
moreover  if and when our projects reach clinical trials  we or our collaborative partners may decide to discontinue development of any or all of these projects at any time for commercial  scientific or other reasons 
any of the foregoing matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even where a product is exempted from fda clearance or approval  the fda may impose restrictions as to the types of customers to which we can market and sell our products 
such restrictions may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many countries  ranging from comprehensive device approval requirements to requests for product data or certifications 
the number and scope of these requirements are increasing 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in such countries or may incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining our foreign regulatory approvals 
in addition  the export by us of certain of our products which have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to fda or other export restrictions 
healthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit our returns on molecular diagnostic products that we may develop with our collaborators 
we are currently developing diagnostic and therapeutic products with our collaborators 
the ability of our collaborators to commercialize such products may depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of these products will be available under us and foreign regulations governing reimbursement for clinical testing services by government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
in the us  third party payor price resistance  the trend towards managed health care and legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs could reduce prices for health care products and services  adversely affect the profits of our customers and collaborative partners and reduce our future royalties 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers and we will be unable to manufacture our products if shipments from these suppliers are delayed or interrupted 
we depend on our vendors to provide components of our products in required volumes  at appropriate quality and reliability levels  and in compliance with regulatory requirements 
key parts of the genechip product line  such as the hybridization oven  certain reagent kits and lithographic masks as well as certain raw materials used in the synthesis of probe arrays  are currently available only from a single source or limited sources 
in addition  components of our manufacturing equipment and certain raw materials used in the synthesis of probe arrays are available from one of only a few suppliers 
if supplies from these vendors were delayed or interrupted for any reason  we would not be able to get manufacturing equipment  produce probe arrays  or sell scanners or other components for our genechip products in a timely fashion or in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms 
our success will require that we establish a strong intellectual property position and that we can defend ourselves against intellectual property claims from others 
maintaining a strong patent position is critical to our competitive advantage 
litigation on these matters has been prevalent in our industry and we expect that this will continue 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving and the extent of future protection is highly uncertain  so there can be no assurance that the patent rights that we have or may obtain will be valuable 
others have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications that are similar or identical to ours or those of our licensors 
to determine the priority of inventions  we will have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office that could result in substantial costs in legal fees and could substantially affect the scope of our patent protection 
we cannot assure investors that any such patent applications will not have priority over our patent applications 
also  our intellectual property may be subject to significant administrative and litigation proceedings such as opposition proceedings against our patents in europe  japan and other jurisdictions 
in addition  we have incurred and may in future periods incur substantial costs in litigation to defend against patent suits brought by third parties and when we initiate such suits 
for example  we currently are engaged in litigation regarding intellectual property rights with multilyte ltd and enzo life sciences  inc for additional information concerning intellectual property litigation and administrative proceedings  see part i  item  legal proceedings  of this form k 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely upon copyright and trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information 
there can be no assurance  however  that such measures will provide adequate protection for our copyrights  trade secrets or other proprietary information 
in addition  there can be no assurance that trade secrets and other proprietary information will not be disclosed  that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our trade secrets and other proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that we can effectively protect our copyrights  trade secrets or other proprietary information 
if we cannot obtain  maintain or enforce intellectual property rights  competitors can design probe array systems similar to our genechip technology 
our success depends in part on us neither infringing patents or other proprietary rights of third parties nor breaching any licenses that may relate to our technologies and products 
we are aware of third party patents that may relate to our technology  including reagents used in probe array synthesis and in probe array assays  probe array scanners  synthesis techniques  polynucleotide amplification techniques  assays  and probe arrays 
we routinely receive notices claiming infringement from third parties as well as invitations to take licenses under third party patents 
there can be no assurance that we will not infringe on these patents or other patents or proprietary rights or that we would be able to obtain a license to such patents or proprietary rights on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we expect to face increasing competition 
the market for molecular diagnostics products is currently limited and highly competitive  with several large companies already having significant market share 
companies such as abbott laboratories  becton dickinson  bayer ag  celera diagnostics  roche diagnostics  johnson johnson  biom rieux and beckman coulter have the strategic commitment to diagnostics  the financial and other resources to invest in new technologies  substantial intellectual property portfolios  substantial experience in new product development  regulatory expertise  manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers 
established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets  including clinical and reference laboratories  which are not compatible with the genechip system and could deter acceptance of our products 
in addition  these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies which provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests 
future competition will likely come from existing competitors as well as other companies seeking to develop new technologies for analyzing genetic information 
for example companies such as applied biosystems  illumina  ge healthcare through its acquisition of amersham biosciences and agilent technologies have introduced new products for gene expression research and analysis 
in addition  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significant needs for genomic information and may choose to develop or acquire competing technologies to meet these needs 
in the molecular diagnostics field  competition will likely come from established diagnostic companies  companies developing and marketing dna probe tests for genetic and other diseases and other companies conducting research on new technologies to ascertain and analyze genetic information 
further  in the event that we develop new technology and products that compete with existing technology and products of well established companies  there can be no guarantee that the marketplace will readily adopt any such new technology and products that we may introduce in the future 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with collaborative partners  we may have difficulty developing and selling our products and services 
we believe that our success in penetrating our target markets depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with key companies as well as with key academic researchers 
currently  our significant collaborative partners include qiagen gmbh for the sample preparation and purification systems  invitrogen corporation for reagents  parallele bioscience  inc for assays and ingenuity systems  inc 
for analytical software 
we collaborate with both beckman coulter inc and caliper life sciences in the development of automation for genechip technology applications for use in drug discovery  drug development and clinical research 
roche  biom rieux and veridex are collaborative partners in the development of chip products for medical diagnostic and applied testing markets 
relying on these or other collaborative relationships is risky to our future success because our partners may develop technologies or components competitive with our genechip products  our existing collaborations may preclude us from entering into additional future arrangements  our partners may not obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner  some of our agreements may terminate prematurely due to disagreements between us and our partners  our partners may not devote sufficient resources to the development and sale of our products  our partners may be unable to provide the resources required for us to progress in the collaboration on a timely basis  our collaborations may be unsuccessful  or we may not be able to negotiate future collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms 
our success depends on the continuous development of new products 
we compete in markets that are new  intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing  and many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources 
in addition  many current and potential competitors have greater name recognition  more extensive customer bases and access to proprietary genetic content 
the continued success of our genechip products will depend on our ability to produce products with smaller feature sizes  our ability to dice the wafer  and create greater information capacity at our current or lower costs 
if we fail to keep pace with emerging technologies our products will become uncompetitive  our pricing and margins will decline and our business will suffer 
we face risks associated with technological obsolescence and emergence of standardized systems for genetic analysis 
the rna dna probe array field is undergoing rapid technological changes 
new technologies  techniques or products could emerge which might allow the packaging and analysis of genomic information at a similar or higher density to our microarray technology 
other companies may begin to offer products that are directly competitive with  or are technologically superior to our products 
although we know of no such technology at the present time  there can be no guarantee that we will be able to maintain our technological advantages over emerging technologies in the future 
over time  we will need to respond to technological innovation in a rapidly changing industry 
in addition  although we believe that we are recognized as a market leader in creating systems for genetic analysis in the life sciences  standardization of tools and systems for genetic research is still ongoing and there can be no assurance that our products will emerge as the standard for genetic research 
the emergence of competing technologies and systems as market standards for genetic research may result in our products becoming uncompetitive and could cause our business to suffer 
the size and structure of our current sales  marketing and technical support organization may limit our ability to sell our products 
although we have invested significant other resources to expand our direct sales force and our technical and support staff  we may not be able to establish a sufficiently sized global sales  marketing or technical support organization to sell  market or support our products globally 
to assist our sales and support activities  we have entered into distribution agreements through certain distributors  principally in markets outside of north america and europe 
these and other third parties on whom we rely for sales  marketing and technical support in these geographic areas may decide to develop and sell competitive products or otherwise become our competitors  which could harm our business 
due to the international nature of our business  political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business 
a significant amount of our revenue is currently generated from sales outside the united states 
though such transactions are denominated in both us dollars and foreign currencies  our future revenue  gross margin  expenses and financial condition are still affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  including export and trade barriers and taxes  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
we are also subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with international operations  such as political  social and economic instability  potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
we cannot assure investors that one or more of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results or require us to modify our current business practices 
we may be exposed to liability due to product defects 
the risk of product liability claims is inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of human diagnostic and therapeutic products 
we may seek to acquire additional insurance for clinical liability risks 
we may not be able to obtain such insurance or general product liability insurance on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts 
a product liability claim or recall could have a serious adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
ethical  legal and social concerns surrounding the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our products 
genetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information 
for these reasons  governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions  particularly for those that have no known cure 
similarly  such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible 
any of these scenarios could reduce the potential markets for our molecular diagnostic products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because our business depends on key executives and scientists  our inability to recruit and retain these people could hinder our business expansion plans 
we are highly dependent on our officers and our senior scientists and engineers  including scientific advisors 
our product development and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed if we are unable to attract or retain key talent 
we rely on our scientific advisors and consultants to assist us in formulating our research  development and commercialization strategy 
all of these individuals are engaged by other employers and have commitments to other entities that may limit their availability to us 
a scientific advisor s other obligations may prevent him or her from assisting us in developing our technical and business strategies 
to expand our research  product development and sales efforts we need additional people skilled in areas such as bioinformatics  organic chemistry  information services  regulatory affairs  manufacturing  sales  marketing and technical support 
competition for these people is intense 
we will not be able to expand our business if we are unable to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel and our failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our effective tax rate may vary significantly 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by various internal and external factors 
these factors include but are not limited to earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
recent accounting pronouncements may impact our future financial position and results of operations 
there may be potential new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings  which may have an impact on our future financial position and results of operations 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the company expects to adopt statement r effective july  under the modified prospective method 
the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend  in part  on levels of share based payments granted prior to the date of adoption 
our strategic equity investments may result in losses 
we periodically make strategic equity investments in various publicly traded and non publicly traded companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business 
the market values of these strategic equity investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control 
other than temporary declines in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies will require us to record losses relative to our ownership interest 
this could result in future charges on our earnings and as a result  it is uncertain whether or not we will realize any long term benefits associated with these strategic investments 
future acquisitions may disrupt our business and distract our management 
we have previously engaged in acquisitions and may do so in the future in order to exploit technology or market opportunities 
if we acquire another company  we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired business into our existing business in a timely and non disruptive manner or at all 
furthermore  an acquisition may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipate 
if we fail to integrate the acquired business effectively or if key employees of that business leave  the anticipated benefits of the acquisition would be jeopardized 
the time  capital management and other resources spent on an acquisition that fails to meet our expectations could cause our business and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  acquisitions can involve substantial charges and amortization of significant amounts of deferred stock compensation that could adversely affect our results of operations 
the market price of our common stock has been extremely volatile 
the market price of our common stock is extremely volatile 
to demonstrate the volatility of our stock price  during the twelve month period ending on december   the volume of our common stock traded on any given day has ranged from  to  shares 
moreover  during that period  our common stock has traded as low as per share and as high as per share 
furthermore  volatility in the stock price of other companies has often led to securities class action litigation against those companies 
for example  purported securities class action lawsuits were filed against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california after a drop in our stock price following our april  announcement updating our financial guidance for the first quarter of these proceedings have been dismissed by the court with prejudice 
future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of less than three years 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted interest rates by year of maturity for our available for sale securities and debt obligations  all of which are denominated in united states dollars  and the fair value of each as of december  and periods of maturity fair value at december  thereafter total assets available for sale securities   average interest rate liabilities senior convertible notes due  average interest rate periods of maturity fair value at december  thereafter total assets available for sale securities    average interest rate liabilities convertible subordinated notes due  average interest rate convertible subordinated notes due  average interest rate senior convertible notes due  average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk we derive a portion of our revenues in foreign currencies  predominantly in europe and japan 
in addition  a portion of our assets are held in nonfunctional currencies of our subsidiaries 
in early  we began hedging activities by using currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency exposures created from our activities denominated in foreign currencies 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our hedging program reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
we hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward contracts and the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the transactions being hedged 
our revenue hedging policy is designed to reduce the negative impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we also hedge a percentage of our assets that are held in nonfunctional currencies of our subsidiaries with forward contracts and the gains or losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the change in value of the underlying asset 
our balance sheet hedging policy is designed to reduce the fluctuations in earnings due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
at december   total outstanding contracts included the notional equivalent of million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a fair market value of million 
as of december   all contracts were set to expire at various times through december the bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk we only contract with reputable institutions 
we apply hedge accounting based upon the criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  whereby we designate our derivatives for revenue hedging purposes as cash flow hedges 
we have elected not to designate our derivatives for balance sheet purposes as fair value hedges under sfas and have appropriately recorded any changes in fair value to interest income and other  net 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for our forward contracts  we used a hypothetical change made to the spot rates of the currency 
a increase in the value of the us dollar would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million
