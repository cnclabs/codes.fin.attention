item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
until july  the company was a diversified holding company with interests in textiles  real estate and energy 
during  the company disposed of its interests in hallwood realty partners  lp  which constituted substantially all of its real estate activities  and hallwood energy corporation  in connection with which it received total cash proceeds of approximately  after payment of debt and other obligations  at december   the company held approximately  in cash and marketable securities 
although the company s textile activities have generated positive cash flow in recent years  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
in addition  the remaining energy entities will require significant additional capital investment over the next few years to acquire additional properties and to adequately explore and develop existing and any new properties 
therefore  the board of directors is considering various proposals to enable the company and its shareholders to best realize the value of the company s assets and businesses  which may include a return of capital to shareholders 
no determinations have yet been made and there can be no assurance that any changes in the company will result from the deliberations 
continuing operations 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from continuing operations from its brookwood subsidiary  and  consequently  the company s success is highly dependent upon brookwood s success 
in the long run  brookwood s success will be influenced in varying degrees by its response to legislation and administrative actions restricting or liberalizing trade among world textile producing and consuming countries such as the nafta  the wto  the effectiveness of anti dumping and countervailing duty remedies and of enforcement activities by the us government  and the value of the united states dollar in relation to other currencies and world economic developments 
however  under nafta with mexico and canada  there are no textile and apparel quotas between the united states and either mexico or canada for products that meet certain origin criteria 
tariffs among the three countries are either already zero or are being phased out 
also  the wto recently phased out textile and apparel quotas 
brookwood continues to identify new market niches to replace sales lost to importers 
in addition to its existing products and proprietary technologies  brookwood has been developing advanced breathable  waterproof laminate materials  which have been well received by its customers 
continued development of these fabrics for military  industrial and consumer applications is a key element of brookwood s business plan 
the ongoing enterprise value of brookwood is contingent on its ability to adapt to the global textile industry  however  there can be no assurance that the positive results of the past can be sustained 
the textile products business is not interdependent with any of the company s other business operations 
the company does not guarantee the brookwood bank debt and is not obligated to contribute additional capital 

table of contents the company s hpl subsidiary commenced operations in october as an operating and management company for the benefit of all energy affiliates 
direct costs are rebilled to the respective energy affiliate and indirect costs are rebilled on a pro rata basis 
discontinued operations 
the company s real estate activities were conducted primarily through the company s wholly owned subsidiaries 
one of the subsidiaries served as the general partner of hrp  a publicly traded master limited partnership 
revenues were generated from the receipt of management fees  leasing commissions and other fees from hrp and third parties and the company s pro rata share of earnings of hrp using the equity method of accounting 
on july   hrp was merged with a subsidiary of hrpt 
as a result  hrp became a wholly owned subsidiary of hrpt and was no longer a publicly traded limited partnership 
the general partner interest in hrp was also sold to a hrpt subsidiary in a separate transaction and the management agreements for the properties were terminated 
the company no longer holds any interest in hrp 
the company received  for its investments in hrp and related assets 
in december  the company decided to discontinue and dispose of its hotel segment  which at that time consisted of five hotel properties 
accordingly  the company s hotel operations were reclassified as a discontinued operation 
two hotels were disposed of in and two hotels were disposed of in the company continued to operate a leasehold interest in one hotel until december  when the hotel subsidiary entered into a lease termination and mutual release agreement 
as of december  the company has no further operations associated with the hotel segment 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in december  the sec requested that registrants identify critical accounting policies in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that the following of its accounting policies fit this description revenue recognition 
textile products sales are recognized upon shipment or release of product  when title passes to the customer 
brookwood provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of brookwood s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
on occasion  brookwood receives instructions from some of its customers to finish fabric  invoice the full amount and hold the finished inventory until the customer sends shipping instructions 
in those cases  brookwood records the sale and sends the customer an invoice containing normal and usual payment terms and segregates the inventory from brookwood s inventory 
equity method of accounting 
the company accounts for its investments in various energy related entities and hrp using the equity method of accounting 
the equity investments in hrp and hec were sold in july and december  respectively 
the equity method is used because the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of each entity 
the company records its pro rata share of each entity s net income loss adjusted for certain items  such as the elimination of intercompany profits  as well as a pro rata share of partners capital and stockholders equity transactions and comprehensive income loss 
deferred income tax asset 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized for net operating loss and certain other tax carryforwards  tax credits and temporary differences  reduced by a valuation allowance  which is 
table of contents established when it is more likely then not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realized 
the company s management is required to estimate taxable income for future years and to use its judgement to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset 
management considers various tax planning strategies  anticipated gains from the potential sale of investments and projected income from operations to determine the valuation allowance to be recorded 
as a result of the significant income earned in and projected income in the future  management eliminated the valuation allowance during impairment of long lived assets 
the company s management routinely reviews its investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the fair value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
in the event such indicators exist for assets held for use  if undiscounted cash flows before interest charges are less than carrying value  the asset is written down to estimated fair value 
for assets held for sale  these assets are carried at the lower of cost or estimated sales price less costs of sale 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
significant assumptions used in this process depend upon the nature of the investment  but would include an evaluation of the future business opportunities  sources of competition  advancement of technology and its impact on patents and processes  future rental and occupancy rates  and the level of expected operating expenses 
inventories 
inventories at the brookwood subsidiary are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or specific identification method or market 
inventories are reviewed and adjusted for changes in market value based on assumptions related to future demand and worldwide and local market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions vary from those projected by management  adjustments to lower of cost or market value may be required 
the policies listed are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in the application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result than those recorded and reported

r  share based payments  which establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions with employees  and carries forward without change prior guidance for share based payments for transactions with non employees 
the company is required to apply sfas no 
r to all awards granted  modified or settled in our first reporting period under us generally accepted accounting principles after june  the company is also required to use either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  the company must recognize compensation cost for all awards granted after we adopt the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that are outstanding on that date 
under the modified retrospective method  the company must restate our previously issued financial statements to recognize the amounts we previously calculated and reported on a pro forma basis  as if the prior standard had been adopted 
under both methods  the company is permitted to use either a straight line or an accelerated method to amortize the cost as an expense for awards with graded vesting 
management commenced its analysis of the impact of sfas r  but has not yet decided whether it will use the modified prospective method or elect to use the modified retrospective method  or whether it will elect to use straight line amortization or an accelerated method 
additionally  it cannot predict with reasonable certainty the number of options that will be unvested and outstanding on july  accordingly  it cannot currently quantify with precision the effect that this standard would have on our financial position or
