the forward looking statements in this discussion regarding the mattress and pillow industries  our expectations regarding our future performance  liquidity and capital resources and other non historical statements in this discussion are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
see special note regarding forward looking statements and part i item business risk factors 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
executive overview general we are a rapidly growing and market leading  vertically integrated manufacturer  marketer and distributor of premium mattresses and pillows that we sell globally in countries primarily under the tempur and tempur pedic brands 
we believe our premium mattresses and pillows are more comfortable than standard bedding products because our proprietary visco elastic pressure relieving material is temperature sensitive  has a high density and conforms to the body to therapeutically align the neck and spine  thus reducing neck and lower back pain  two of the most common complaints about other sleep surfaces 
tempur pedic international was formed in by ta and ffl to acquire tempur world  inc  or tempur world 
this acquisition occurred effective november  and we sometimes refer to this below as the tempur acquisition 
the financial information for the periods prior to november  are based on the financial information for tempur world and its consolidated subsidiaries  which we sometimes collectively refer to as our predecessor company 
for purposes of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we  our  ours and us refer to tempur pedic international and its consolidated subsidiaries for the period from and after november  and refer to our predecessor company for periods prior to november  
table of contents on december   tempur pedic international closed its initial public offering of  shares of its common stock at an initial offering price of per share 
of the  shares offered  the company sold  shares and certain of the company s stockholders sold a total of  shares  which included the exercise in full of the underwriters overallotment option 
on november   the company closed a secondary offering of  shares of its common stock  including the subsequent exercise in full of the underwriters overallotment option  at an offering price of per share 
all shares were sold by certain of the company s stockholders pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement entered into in november in connection with the tempur acquisition 
the company incurred million in expenses associated with this offering 
business segment information we have two operating business segments domestic and international 
these reportable segments are strategic business units that are managed separately 
the domestic operating segment consists of our united states manufacturing facility  which commenced operations in july and whose customers include our united states distribution subsidiary and certain north american third party distributors 
the international segment consists of our manufacturing facility in denmark  whose customers include all of our distribution subsidiaries and third party distributors outside the domestic segment 
we evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income 
for the purpose of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  our corporate office operating expenses and certain amounts for goodwill and other assets that are carried at the holding company level are included in the domestic operating segment 
economic and industry trends the international sleep products association ispa estimates that the united states wholesale market for mattresses and foundations in was approximately billion 
we believe the international mattress market is generally the same size as the domestic mattress market 
according to ispa  from to  mattress unit sales grew in the united states at an average of approximately  units annually  with approximately million mattress units sold in the united states in  although annual sales decreased during the to period 
we believe a similar number of mattress units were sold outside the united states in ispa further estimates that approximately of those mattress units were sold at retail price points greater than  which is the premium segment of the market we target and which we believe is the fastest growing segment in the industry 
strategy and outlook our long term goal is to become the world s largest bedding company 
in order to achieve this goal  we expect to continue to pursue certain key strategies in we currently intend to maintain our focus primarily on premium mattresses and pillows and to regularly introduce new products 
in  we expect to introduce a futon product for the japanese market and at least one new mattress in europe and one new mattress in the us we plan to continue to invest in increasing our global brand awareness through targeted marking and advertising campaigns that further associate our brand name with better overall sleep and premium quality products 
we plan to continue to extend our presence in furniture and bedding retail stores in both the us and internationally 
we plan to continue to invest in our operating infrastructure to meet the requirements of our rapidly growing business  including increases in our manufacturing capacity and our research and development capacity 

table of contents factors that may affect future performance managing rapid growth we have grown rapidly  with our net sales increasing from million in to million for our growth has placed  and will continue to place  a strain on our management  production  product distribution network  information systems and other resources 
in response to these challenges  management has continued to invest in increased production capacity  enhanced operating and financial infrastructure and systems and continued to expand the employee base in our operations 
our expenditures for advertising and other marketing related activities are made as advertising rates are favorable to us and as the continued growth in the business allows us the ability to invest in building our brand 
competition participants in the mattress and pillow industries compete primarily on price  quality  brand name recognition  product availability and product performance 
we compete with a number of different types of mattress alternatives  including standard innerspring mattresses  other foam mattresses  waterbeds  futons  air beds and other air supported mattresses 
these alternative products are sold through a variety of channels  including furniture stores  specialty bedding stores  department stores  mass merchants  wholesale clubs  telemarketing programs  television infomercials and catalogs 
our largest competitors have significant financial  marketing and manufacturing resources and strong brand name recognition  and sell their products through broad and well established distribution channels 
additionally  we believe that a number of our significant competitors now offer mattress products claimed to be similar to our visco elastic mattresses and pillows 
we are susceptible to competition from lower priced product offerings 
we provide strong channel profits to our retailers and distributors which management believes will continue to provide an attractive business model for our retailers and discourage them from carrying competing lower priced products 
significant growth opportunities we currently sell our products in approximately  furniture retail stores in the united states  out of a total of approximately  stores we have identified as appropriate targets 
we also sell products in approximately  furniture retail stores outside the united states  out of a total of approximately  stores that management has identified as appropriate targets 
in addition  we have a significant installed pillow base in our asia market that we believe creates an opportunity to develop a successful mattress market 
we are continuing to develop products that are responsive to consumer demand in our markets internationally 
we are also continuing to expand our direct response business in europe  based on our direct response businesses in the united states and in the united kingdom  to reach a greater number of consumers and increase our brand awareness 
in addition to these growth opportunities  management believes that we currently supply only a small percentage of approximately  nursing homes and  hospitals in the us  with a collective bed count in excess of million 
clinical evidence indicates that our products are both effective and cost efficient for the prevention and treatment of decubitis  or bed sores  a major problem for elderly and bed ridden patients 
a change in the us medicare and medicaid reimbursement policies toward prevention of bed sores and away from treatment could expand our growth potential in this market 
during the fourth quarter of  we hired a new president for tempur pedic medical  inc financial leverage as of december   we had million of long term debt outstanding  and our stockholders equity was million 
higher financial leverage makes us more vulnerable to general adverse competitive  economic and industry conditions 
we believe that operating margins combined with the inherent operating leverage in the business will enable us to continue de leveraging the business in a manner consistent with historical experience 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our senior credit facility  or otherwise  to enable us to continue to de leverage the business 

table of contents exchange rates we have costs and revenues denominated in many currencies  and accordingly  as a result of currency fluctuations against the us dollar  our results of operations could be adversely impacted when these foreign costs and revenues are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to changes in value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily with respect to our denmark manufacturing operations 
our outlook assumes no significant changes in currency values from current rates 
should currency rates change sharply  our results could be negatively impacted 
although we have in the past entered into hedging transactions to manage this risk and expect that we will continue to do so in the future  the hedging transactions may not succeed in managing our foreign currency exchange rate risk 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposures under part ii of this report 
for the purposes of financial reporting  any change in the value of foreign currency against the united states dollar during a given financial reporting period would result in a foreign exchange gain or loss on the translation of any united states dollar denominated debt into such foreign currency 
we do not enter into hedging transactions to hedge this risk 
consequently  our reported earnings and financial position debt could fluctuate materially as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposures under part ii of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management is responsible for our financial statements and has evaluated the accounting policies to be used in their preparation 
our management believes these policies are reasonable and appropriate 
the following discussion identifies those accounting policies that we believe are critical in the preparation of our financial statements  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies and the possibility that materially different amounts will be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that the management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition our estimates of sales returns are a critical component of our revenue recognition 
we recognize sales  net of estimated returns  when we ship our products to customers and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to them 
estimated sales returns are provided at the time of sale  based on our level of historical sales returns 
we allow returns for up to days following a sale  depending on the channel and promotion 
our level of sales returns differs by channel  with our direct channel typically experiencing the highest rate of returns 
our level of returns has been consistent with our estimates and has been improving steadily over the last year as our retail channel  which experiences lower returns than other sales channels  continues to grow as a percentage of overall net sales 
warranties cost of sales includes estimated costs to service warranty claims of our customers 
our estimate is based on our historical claims experience and extensive product testing that we perform from time to time 
we provide a year warranty for united states sales and a year warranty for non united states sales on mattresses  each prorated for the last years 
because our products have not been in use by our customers for the full warranty period  we rely on the combination of historical experience and product testing for the development of our estimate for warranty claims 
our estimate of warranty claims could be adversely affected if our historical experience ultimately proves to be greater than the performance of the product in our product testing 
we also provide year to year warranties on pillows 
estimated future obligations related to these products are provided by charges to operations in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
our estimated obligation for warranty claims as of december  was million 
as of december   our estimated obligation for warranty claims was million 

table of contents impairment of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets goodwill reflected in our consolidated balance sheets consists of the purchase price from the tempur acquisition in excess of the estimated fair values of identifiable net assets as of the date of the tempur acquisition 
intangibles consist of tradenames for various brands under which our products are sold 
other intangibles include our customer database for our direct channel  process technology and the formulation of our visco elastic pressure relieving material 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that whenever events or circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the net book value of our productive assets through future cash flows  an assessment must be performed of expected future cash flows  and undiscounted estimated future cash flows must be compared to the net book value of these productive assets to determine if impairment is indicated 
impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair value by recording an impairment charge to earnings 
sfas provides that fair values may be estimated using discounted cash flow analysis or quoted market prices  together with other available information  to estimate fair values 
we primarily use discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of productive assets when events or circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover our net book values 
we perform an annual impairment test on all goodwill and unamortized indefinite life intangible assets in the fourth quarter each year 
we performed the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of to all existing goodwill and unamortized indefinite life intangible assets and no impairment existed as of december  if facts and circumstances lead our management to believe that one of our assets may be impaired  we will evaluate the extent to which that cost is recoverable by comparing the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be associated with that asset to the asset s carrying amount and write down that carrying amount to fair value to the extent necessary 
the application of sfas requires the exercise of significant judgment and the preparation of numerous significant estimates 
although we believe that our estimates of cash flows in our application of sfas are reasonable  and based upon all available information  including historical cash flow data about the prior use of our assets  such estimates nevertheless require substantial judgments and are based upon material assumptions about future events 
estimates of fair value for our reporting units involve highly subjective judgments on the part of management  including the amounts of cash flows to be received  their estimated duration  and perceived risk as reflected in selected discount rates 
in some cases  cash flows may be required to be estimated without the benefit of historical data  although historical data will be used where available 
although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable  different assumptions and judgments could result in different impairment  if any  of some or all of our recorded goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles of million as of december  and million as of december  income tax accounting income taxes are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
sfas requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these deferred taxes are measured by applying the provisions of tax laws in effect at the balance sheet date 

table of contents we recognize deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets  and these deferred tax assets typically represent items deducted currently from operating income in the financial statements that will be deducted in future periods in tax returns 
in accordance with sfas  a valuation allowance is recorded against these deferred tax assets to reduce the total deferred tax assets to an amount that will  more likely than not  be realized in future periods 
the valuation allowance is based  in part  on our estimate of future taxable income  the expected utilization of tax loss carryforwards  both domestic and foreign  and the expiration dates of tax loss carryforwards 
significant assumptions are used in developing the analysis of future taxable income for purposes of determining the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which  in our opinion  are reasonable under the circumstances 
in conjunction with the tempur acquisition  on november  tempur pedic international repatriated million from one of its foreign subsidiaries in the form of a loan that under applicable us tax principles is treated as a taxable dividend 
on march   the million note was distributed principally in the form of a capital distribution under applicable foreign law from the foreign subsidiary lender up the chain of foreign and domestic subsidiaries to tempur world  llc borrower and cancelled on march  at december   tempur pedic international had undistributed earnings from its foreign subsidiaries determined under us tax principles as of november   translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate on december   of million 
provisions have been made for us income taxes on million of these undistributed earnings pursuant to section of the internal revenue code code  as translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates on november  no provisions have been made for us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the remaining million of undistributed earnings  as these earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested 
in addition  tempur pedic international had undistributed earnings from its foreign subsidiaries determined under us generally accepted accounting principles for the period november  through december  of million 
provisions have been made for us income taxes on million of these undistributed earnings pursuant to subpart f and section of the code 
no provisions have been made for us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the remaining million of undistributed earnings  as these earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested 
these undistributed earnings could become subject to us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes subject to a reduction for foreign tax credits if these undistributed earnings were remitted as dividends  loaned to tempur pedic international or a us subsidiary  or if the company should sell its stock in the applicable subsidiaries 
however  on october  the president signed the american jobs creation act of  which allows a temporary elective dividends received deduction for cash dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries to their us corporate shareholder in either or this provision could potentially allow tempur pedic international to repatriate the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner 
the management of tempur pedic international is in the initial stages of its evaluation of the effects of this repatriation provision and expects to complete its evaluation during the second quarter of the related range of income tax effects of any such repatriation cannot be reasonably determined at this time 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no

 accounting for stock based compensation 
several companies recently elected to change their accounting policies and record the fair value of options as an expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposures our earnings  as a result of our global operating and financing activities  are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
a sensitivity analysis indicates that if the exchange rate of the united states dollar to foreign currency at december  increased by  we would incur losses of approximately million on foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december  such losses would be largely offset by gains from the revaluation or settlement of the underlying positions economically hedged 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the united states dollar 

table of contents within the normal course of business  we use derivative financial instruments principally to manage the exposure to changes in the value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of our denmark manufacturing operations 
gains and losses are recognized currently in the results of operations and are generally offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged 
gains and losses on these contracts generally offset losses and gains on our foreign currency receivables and foreign currency debt 
we do not hedge the effects of foreign exchange rates fluctuations on the translation of its foreign results of operations or financial position  nor do we hedge exposure related to anticipated transactions 
we do not apply hedge accounting to the foreign currency forward contracts used to offset currency related changes in the fair value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
these contracts are marked to market through earnings at the same time that the exposed assets and liabilities are re measured through earnings 
our currency forward contracts are denominated in united states dollars  british pound sterling and japanese yen  each against the danish krone 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
all of our indebtedness under our senior credit facility is variable rate debt 
interest rate changes therefore generally do not affect the market value of such debt but do impact the amount of our interest payments and therefore  our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
on december   we had variable rate debt of approximately million 
holding other variables constant including levels of indebtedness  a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt would have an estimated impact on income before income taxes for the next year of approximately million 
we are required under the terms of our senior credit facility  to have at least million of our total indebtedness subject to either a fixed interest rate or interest rate protection for a period of not less than three years within days from the date of the closing of the recapitalization 
in january  we paid a premium to purchase two three year interest rate caps for the purpose of protecting million of the existing variable interest rate debt outstanding  at any given time  against libor rates rising above 
under the terms of the interest rate caps  we have paid a premium to receive payments based on the difference between month libor and during any period in which the month libor rate exceeds 
the interest rate caps settle on the last day of march  june  september and december until expiration 
as a result of entering into the interest rate caps  we have mitigated our exposure to interest rate fluctuations above the predetermined level 
as the interest payments on long term debt are based on month libor and we receive a payment based on the difference between the set ceiling and month libor from the interest rate cap counter party  we have eliminated any impact to rising interest rates above the stated ceiling  for an amount equal to million of our total debt outstanding 
the fair value carrying amount of these instruments for december  and december  are presented below in millions december  december  foreign exchange receivable interest rate caps total
