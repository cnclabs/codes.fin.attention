all operating groups are growth oriented ethical businesses  focused on environmental responsibility and the health and well being of its communities 
during the year  the company expanded its reporting segment of the food group and has further defined this segment into grains and soy products group grains group  the foundation of the food group  specializing in bringing a number of identity preserved  non genetically modified and organic grains and related agronomic services to market with a core focus in soy  sunflower  corn  rice and oats  sunopta ingredients group ingredients group  specializing in the technical processing of specialty food ingredients  with a focus on non genetically modified  natural  functional and organic offerings  packaged products group packaged group which includes an aseptic packaged products business focused on the production of soymilk and other beverage products  a healthy convenience food business  a us branded packaged products business  and a canadian packaged products business  and finally  the canadian distribution food group distribution group focused on building a canadian national natural  organic  kosher and specialty food distribution system 
the results of operations for the expanded reporting segments have been disclosed for and  but results have not been expanded due to reporting constraints 
the management s discussion and analysis md a  detailed below  is presented in six parts  critical accounting estimates  results of operations versus and versus  recent accounting developments  liquidity and capital resources  business outlook and risks and uncertainties  and should be read in conjunction with the december  consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
business outlook and risks and uncertainties can be found in part ii item of this document 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related revenues and expenses  and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions made require judgment on the part of management and are based on the company s historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances 
management continually evaluates the information that forms the basis of its estimates and assumptions as the business of the company and the business environment generally changes 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the company s financial statements 
the following are the accounting estimates which management believes to be most important to the business of the company 
revenue recognition i sunopta food group grain revenues are recorded when title is transferred which is usually at time of shipment 
revenues from custom processing services are recorded upon provision of services and upon completion of quality testing 
all other food group revenues are recognized when title is transferred which is usually upon the shipment of product or at the time the service is provided to the customer 
ii opta minerals group revenues from the sale of silica free loose abrasives  industrial minerals  specialty sands and related products are recognized upon the sale and shipment of the related minerals 
revenues from recycling activities are recognized upon the sale and shipment or the disposal of non hazardous material received 
iii staketech steam explosion group the percentage of completion method is used to account for significant contracts in progress when related costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company uses costs incurred to date as a percentage of total expected costs to measure the extent of progress towards completion 
license fees related to the right to sell the company s technologies are recorded as revenues over the term of the license  when collectibility is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable the company s accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from its customers 
the carrying value of each account is carefully monitored with a view to assessing the likelihood of collection 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for as an estimate of losses that could result from customers defaulting on their obligation to the company 
in assessing the amount of reserve required  a number of factors are considered including the age of the account  the credit worthiness of the customer  payment terms  the customer s historical payment history and general economic conditions 
because the amount of the reserve is an estimate  the actual amount collected could differ from the carrying value of the debt 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the movements in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory inventory is the company s largest current asset 
the company s inventory consists primarily of finished goods held for sale 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost  valued on a first in  first out basis  or estimate net realizable value except certain grain inventories that are carried at market value 
sunopta assesses the net realizable value of its inventory on a regular basis by reviewing  on an item by item basis  the realizable value of its inventory  net of anticipated selling costs 
if it is management s judgment that the selling price of an item must be lowered below its cost in order for it to be sold  then the carrying value of the related inventory is written down to the net realizable value 
a number of factors would be taken into consideration in assessing the net realizable value including the quantity on hand  age and expiration  historical sales  consumer demand and preferences 
depending on market conditions  the actual amount received on sale could differ from management s estimate 
impairment of goodwill other intangible assets in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fasb  the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
fasb requires that if the carrying value of a reporting unit for which goodwill exists exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  the company has evaluated its goodwill for impairment and has determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceed their carrying value  and as a result no impairment of goodwill has been recorded 
goodwill of  is recorded in the financial statements as at december  during the year the company wrote off impaired trademarks with a pre tax value of  this intangible was obtained on the acquisition of first light foods in in the fourth quarter the company made the decision to focus all future soy and rice shelf stable beverage packaging efforts in supplying existing customers only and to market aseptic packaging capabilities to the rapidly growing private label market 
the private label market in north america has grown substantially in recent years as retailers recognize the benefit of generating consumer loyalty with an in house brand 
as a result  the company has de emphasized the use of brands in the soy and rice shelf stable beverage market  and have written off the value of these trademarks recorded on the balance sheet 
accrued expenses and other assets the company is constantly required to make estimates of future payments that will be made and received which relate to current and future accounting periods 
these estimates range from things such as accrued but unpaid wages and bonuses  estimates of capital taxes and estimates of amounts receivable under legal suits 
in establishing appropriate accruals and receivable balances  management must make judgements regarding the amount of the disbursement or receipts that will ultimately be incurred or received 
in making such assessments  management uses historical experience as well as any other special circumstances surrounding a particular item 
the actual amount paid or received could differ from management s estimate 
income taxes the company is liable for income taxes in the united states and canada 
in making an estimate of its income tax liability the company must first make an assessment of which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular jurisdiction 
this process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes 
these differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses result in deferred income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on the company s balance sheet 
the company also makes an estimate on the amount of valuation allowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to reduce future taxes payable 
management assesses the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of the tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses which they can be applied to  the number of years based on management s estimate it will take to use the tax assets and any other special circumstances 
if different judgements had been used  the company s income tax liability could have been different from the amount recorded 
in addition  the taxing authorities of those jurisdictions upon audit may not agree with the company s assessment 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the movements in the valuation allowance

in addition  the us line of credit facility was increased by  to  the company also secured a  revolving acquisition facility to finance future acquisitions and capital expenditures 
no draws have been made on this facility 
the term loan is repayable quarterly and has been extended to june  all credit facilities bear interest at various reference rates including us bank prime  us libor and or canadian bank prime plus a premium based on certain financial ratios of the company 
these are collateralised by a first priority security against substantially all of the company s assets in both canada and the united states 
in february  the company amended its credit agreement for the primary purpose of releasing all secured collateral relating to opta minerals in anticipation of the initial public offering 
opta minerals inc has also received a term sheet with a canadian chartered bank that has committed to provide the company with a operating facility of up to cdn  and a term facility for up to cdn  other debt facilities were entered into during the year including debt issued with the acquisition of supreme foods and certain capital leases 
these have been disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements

business outlook the natural and organic foods industries in the north american market are currently estimated by management to be in excess of billion growing at a rate of to annually 
while a large number of companies compete within specific segments of the market  there are relatively few companies as well positioned as sunopta to take advantage of this rapidly growing market 
based on current market projections and annualized results of the acquisitions completed in  the company expects revenues in  excluding additional potential acquisitions  to be approximately  a increase over in addition  the company s business plan includes strategies and initiatives designed to improve the underlying performance of the operations and to improve the quality of earnings 
specifically  the company is looking to improve the strategic synergies across its food operations  vertically integrating wherever possible 
initiatives to improve the productivity of the operations include  plant rationalization programs  continued training and development of employees  consolidated procurement and internal services programs and consolidated information and accounting systems to provide better analysis and timely decision making 
the company expects to continue its rapid growth through an effective balance of internal growth and acquisitions  all in support of its vertically integrated field to table strategy 
maintaining liquidity and having available sources of cash will be imperative if the company is to continue to grow 
at december  the company had  in cash and approximately  in unused bank lines for a total of  in cash availability 
the company also has an unused acquisition line of  the company s remaining cash and unused lines plus cash generated from operations are sufficient to finance capital maintenance estimated at  annual debt service of  and payment of the remaining current portion of long term payables of  plus finance targeted internal growth and acquisitions 
additional sources of cash which could be obtained through a combination of additional bank or subordinated financing  a private or public offering  or the issuance of shares in relation to an acquisition or a divestiture 
the company intends to maintain a target debt to equity ratio of no greater than to versus the current position of to if the company s current operating lines were maximized to full borrowing base metrics and long term debt was increased to to debt to equity ratio  incremental funds for growth in excess of  should be available 
the table below sets out the company s obligation under its long term debt  long term payables  operating and capital leases at december  and thereafter total long term debt capital leases     operating leases     long term payables     this table does not include certain contingent consideration related to acquisitions in  and that may become payable if predetermined profit target are achieved 
risks associated with rapid growth are detailed below the company will continue to devote significant effort to increase returns on capital by improving its investment in working capital and capital projects with increased accountability and measurement 
risks and uncertainties the common shares of the company are speculative in nature and involve a high degree of risk 
accordingly  in analyzing an investment in these securities  prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors  together with all of the other information appearing  or incorporated by reference  in this document  in light of his or her particular financial circumstances and or investment objectives 
these risk factors could materially and adversely affect the company s future operating results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those described in forward looking statements relating to the company 
we need additional capital to maintain current growth rates over the last seven years the company has had a compounded annual growth rate of 
our ability to raise capital  through equity and or debt financing  is directly related to our ability to continue to grow and improve returns from operations 
additional capital through equity financing may also result in additional dilution to our current shareholders and a decrease in our share price if we are unable to realize returns equal to or above our current rate of return 
we will not be able to maintain our growth rate and our strategy as a consolidator within the natural and organic food industries without continued access to capital 
exercise of warrants and stock options  participation in our employee stock purchase plan and issuance of additional securities could dilute the value of our common shares as of december   there are approximately  warrants and stock options outstanding to purchase common shares  with exercise prices ranging from to per common share 
the exercise of these warrants and stock options could result in dilution in the value of our common shares and the voting power represented thereby 
furthermore  to the extent the holders of our warrants and stock options exercise such securities and then sell the common shares they receive upon exercise or upon the sale of common shares received as part of the employee stock purchase plan or the issuance of additional securities  our share price may decrease due to the additional amount of common shares available in the market 
the subsequent sales of these shares could encourage short sales by our shareholders and others which could place further downward pressure on our share price 
moreover  the holders of our warrants and stock options may hedge their positions in our common shares by short selling our common shares  which could further adversely affect our stock price 
consumer preferences for natural and organic food products are difficult to predict and may change of our fiscal consolidated revenue was derived from the food group 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to offer products that anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and appeal to their preferences on a timely and affordable basis 
a significant shift in consumer demand away from our products or products that utilize our integrated ingredients  or our failure to maintain our current market position could reduce our sales  which could harm our business 
consumer trends change based on a number of possible factors  including nutritional values  such as a change in preference from fat free to reduced fat to no reduction in fat  and a shift in preference from organic to non organic and from natural products to non natural products 
these changes could lead to  among other things  reduced demand and price decreases  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we operate in a highly competitive industry we carry on businesses in highly competitive product and geographic markets in the us  canada and various international markets 
the grains group and the ingredients group compete with large companies in the us and various international commercial grain procurement marketers  major chemical companies with food ingredient divisions  other food ingredient companies  stabilizer companies and consumer food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food ingredients 
the food group s packaged group and distribution group competes against other organic and natural food distributors  conventional food distributors and significantly larger food companies that provide specialty or high end packaged products 
many of these competitors have financial resources and staff larger than ours and may be able to benefit from economies of scale  pricing advantages and greater resources to launch new products that compete with our offerings 
we have little control over and cannot otherwise affect these competitive factors 
if we are unable to effectively respond to these competitive factors or if the competition in any of our product markets results in price reductions or decreased demand for our products  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially impacted 
we rely on our manufacturing facilities we own  manage and operate a number of manufacturing  processing and packaging facilities located throughout the u 
s 
and canada 
the food group operates from eighteen processing facilities fourteen owned  four leased in seven us states and one canadian province 
opta minerals group operates from seven locations three owned  four leased located throughout the u 
s 
and canada 
the staketech steam explosion group operates its facilities at our corporate location in norval  ontario 
an interruption in or the loss of operations at one or more of these facilities  or the failure to maintain our labour force at one or more of these facilities  could delay or postpone production of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition until we could secure an alternate source of supply 
the loss of key management or our inability to attract and retain management talent could adversely affect our business our future prospects depend to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key executives 
furthermore  our continued growth depends on our ability to identify  recruit and retain key management personnel 
the competition for such employees is intense 
we are also dependent on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate our sourcing  production  distribution  sales  marketing and other personnel 
we rely on our ability to manage our supply chain efficiently our supply chain is complex 
we rely on third parties for our raw materials and for the manufacturing  processing and distribution of many of our products 
the inability of any of these third parties to deliver or perform for us in a timely or cost effective manner could cause our operating costs to rise and our margins to fall 
many of our products are perishable and require timely processing and transportation to our customers 
many of our products can only be stored for a limited amount of time before they spoil and cannot be sold 
we must continuously monitor our inventory and product mix against forecasted demand  or risk having inadequate supplies to meet consumer demand as well as having too much inventory that may reach its expiration date 
if we are unable to manage our supply chain efficiently and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand  our operating costs could increase and our margins could fall 
volatility in the prices of raw materials could increase our cost of sales and reduce our gross margin raw materials used in the food group and opta minerals group represent a significant portion of our cost of sales 
our cost to purchase these materials  such as organic grains and abrasive industrial minerals  from our suppliers can fluctuate depending on many factors  including weather patterns  economic and political conditions and pricing volatility 
in addition  we must compete with competitors having substantially greater resources than us for limited supplies of these raw materials 
if the cost of these materials increases due to any of the above factors  we may not be able to pass along the increased costs to our customers 
the food group enters into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on grain transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk from market price fluctuations 
futures contracts used for hedging purposes are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges 
inventories  however  may not be completely hedged  due in part to our assessment of our exposure from expected price fluctuations 
exchange purchase and sales contracts may expose us to risk in the event that a counter party to a transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation 
we are unable to hedge of the price risk of each transaction due to timing  availability of hedge contracts and third party credit risk 
in addition  we have a risk of loss from hedge activity if a grower does not deliver the grain as scheduled 
technological innovation by competitors could make our products less competitive competitors include major chemical companies  other food ingredient companies and consumer food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food ingredients 
many of these companies are engaged in the development of texturizers and other food ingredients and have introduced a number of texturizers into the market 
existing products or products under development by our competitors could prove to be more effective or less costly than any products which have been or are being developed by us 
we rely on protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights we and particularly our food group and staketech steam explosion group depend  in part  on our ability to protect intellectual property rights 
we rely primarily on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies 
the failure of any patents or other intellectual property rights to provide protection to our technologies would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products  which could result in lower sales or gross margins 
the food group has developed a number of new ingredients and alternatives to accommodate new product adaptations of these and other ingredients into various food items 
the nature of a number of the food group s products and processes requires us to create and maintain a number of patents and trade secrets 
the food group s policy is to protect its technology by  among other things  filing patent applications for technology relating to the development of its business in the us and in selected foreign jurisdictions 
our trademarks and brand names are registered in the united states  canada and other jurisdictions and we intend to keep these filings current and seek protection for new trademarks to the extent consistent with business needs 
we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how and confidentiality agreements to protect certain of the technologies and processes used by the food group 
in addition  the staketech steam explosion group holds a number of patents on its steam explosion process 
we recognize that there exists a threat of others attempting to copy our proprietary steam explosion technology 
to mitigate this risk  the normal business practice of this group includes the signing of confidentiality agreements with all parties to which confidential information is supplied including all customers and licensees 
we also hold several patents on our equipment and process technologies 
we are subject to substantial environmental regulation and policies we are  and expect to continue to be  subject to substantial federal  state  provincial and local environmental regulation 
there are specific regulations governing the recycling of solid waste material regulated by the ontario ministry of environment and energy and the commonwealth of virginia  department of environment quality 
some of the key regulations include air quality regulated by environmental protection agency epa and certain city state air pollution control groups 
emission reports are filed annually  waste treatment disposal solid waste is either disposed of by a third party or in some cases the company has a permit to haul and apply the sludge to land 
agreements exist with local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified levels of biochemical oxygen demand bod and total suspended solids tss  sewer agreements with the local city sewer districts to treat waste as specified limits of bod and tss  which requires weekly monthly reporting as well as annual inspection  and hazardous chemicals various reports are filed with local city state emergency response agencies to identify potential hazardous toxic chemicals being used  including reports filed with the department of public safety emergency response commission in minnesota and the kentucky emergency response commission 
permits are required from various state  provincial and local authorities  including the minnesota pollution control agency  the commonwealth of virginia  department of environmental quality and the ontario ministry of environment related to air quality  storm water discharge  solid waste  land spreading and hazardous waste 
in the event that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of potentially hazardous materials in certain of our businesses were to fail  we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future 
in addition  changes to environmental regulations may require us to modify our existing plant and processing facilities and could significantly increase the cost of those operations 
our soymilk processing facility and aseptic packaging facility  both located in alexandria  minnesota  are currently not in complete compliance with the industrial permit limits for the discharge of industrial wastewater 
to restore compliance  we have applied for increased discharge limits 
we have installed a pretreatment system which came online in early and significantly modified a number of internal processes to reduce discharges 
the company is currently negotiating with the local sanitary district to obtain new permits for these facilities 
if we fail to regain compliance through the foregoing actions  we could be required to reduce our discharge of such industrial wastewater to approved levels  which may force us to reduce production and or transfer part of our production capabilities to other facilities 
the foregoing environmental regulations  as well as others common to the industries in which we participate  can present delays and costs that can adversely affect business development and growth 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures  as well as potential criminal sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  any changes to current regulations may impact the development  manufacturing and marketing of our products  and may have a negative impact on our future results 
the food group is subject to significant food regulations the food group is affected by state and federal fertilizer  pesticide  food processing  grain buying and warehousing  and wholesale food regulations 
government sponsored price supports and acreage set aside programs are two examples of policies that may affect the food group 
the food group is currently in compliance with all state and federal regulations 
because the food group is involved in the manufacture  supply  processing and marketing of organic seed and food products  it is voluntarily subject to certain organic quality assurance standards 
certain food ingredient products are regulated under the food additive amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act of fdca  as administered by the united states food and drug administration fda 
under the fdca  pre marketing approval by the fda is required for the sale of a food ingredient which is a food additive unless the substance is generally recognized as safe gras under the conditions of its intended use by qualified experts in food safety 
we believe that most products for which the food group has retained commercial rights are gras 
however  such status cannot be determined until actual formulations and uses are finalized 
as a result  the food group may be adversely impacted if the fda determines that our food ingredient products do not meet the criteria for gras 
in december  the usda adopted regulations with respect to a national organic labeling and certification program which became fully effective in october these regulations  among other things  set forth the minimum standards producers must meet in order to have their products labeled as certified organic 
we currently manufacture and distribute a number of organic products that are covered by these new regulations 
while we believe our products and our supply chain are in compliance with these regulations  changes to food regulations may increase our costs to remain in compliance 
in addition  in january  the fda proposed new policy guidelines regarding the labeling of genetically engineered foods 
these guidelines  if adopted  could require us to modify the labeling of our products  which could affect the sales of our products and thus harm our business 
we could lose our organic certification if a facility becomes contaminated with non organic materials or if we do not use raw materials that are certified organic 
the loss of our organic certifications could materially harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
recently  a court decision in the harvey vs 
veneman lawsuit ruled that three provisions in the us national organic program nop relating to organic ingredients and animal feed were not valid 
the organic trade association ota has learned that the decision could affect certified organic handlers that make organic products which use any of the materials listed in b of the nop regulations  including products in the made with organic ingredients category 
the ota has stated it would work with the us department of agriculture to help address these issues and is optimistic that its members and others in the organic community can pull together to maintain the momentum for organic agriculture 
in addition  ota is encouraging a rehearing of the case  is considering viable legislative options  and is pursuing with usda other options that would maintain balance in the current regulations 
however  as the ruling is new  the potential impact is  as yet  indeterminable 
product liability suits  if brought  could have a material adverse effect on our business as a manufacturer and marketer of natural and organic food products and environmental mineral products  we are subject to the risk of claims for product liability 
if a product liability claim exceeding our insurance coverage were to be successfully asserted against us  it could materially harm our business 
acceptance of staketech steam explosion technology the staketech steam explosion group s technology has yet to gain wide acceptance within the industry and  consequently  earnings can fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
its patented steam technology  while proven  has yet to develop a firm customer base 
the success of this division will depend upon its ability to promote commercial acceptance of our steam explosion technology 
we are subject to financial exposure related to bonding and guarantees for the staketech steam explosion group to enter international markets  we expect to have to provide substantial performance guarantees in the form of process guarantees and equipment guarantees 
these guarantees will need to be backed by bank guarantees and or surety bonds 
we endeavor to reduce the associated risks  however there will always remain a possibility that our guarantees or bonds could be called  rightfully or wrongfully and or that the equipment supplied fails to meet the guarantees and warranties provided resulting in potential financial losses 
we are subject to dividend restrictions and potential withholding taxes on dividends we have not paid dividends on our common shares since our inception and have used available cash resources to fund growth 
moreover  we are precluded under the terms of various agreements with our creditors from paying dividends without approval from certain creditors 
it is our intention to retain future earnings to fund growth 
we will consider paying dividends on our common shares in the future when circumstances permit  having regard to  among other things  our earnings  cash flow and financial requirements  as well as relevant legal and business considerations 
accordingly  investors should not expect to receive a return on investment in our common shares through the payment of dividends in the foreseeable future and may not realize a return on investment even if they sell their shares 
any future payment of dividends to holders of our common shares will depend on decisions that will be made by the board of directors and will depend on then existing conditions  including our financial condition  contractual restrictions  capital requirements and business prospects 
also  if we pay dividends  the receipt of cash dividends by united states shareholders from a canadian corporation may be subject to a to canadian withholding tax 
loss of our key customer could materially reduce revenues and earnings we have one customer  the hain celestial group  whose purchases from sunopta in fiscal amounted to approximately of our revenue 
as a result of this concentration of our customer base  the loss or cancellation of business from the hain celestial group could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our operating results and share price are subject to significant volatility our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to changes in our operating expenses  management s ability to execute our business and growth strategies  personnel changes  supply shortages  general economic conditions  changes in customer preferences and demands for natural and organic food products  volatility in commodity prices resulting from poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  and future acquisitions  particularly in periods immediately following the consummation of such acquisition transactions while the operations of the acquired businesses are being integrated into our operations 
in addition  our share price is more volatile than other larger public companies 
announcements regarding fluctuations in financial performance from period to period  mergers and acquisitions  strategic partnerships or arrangements  litigation and governmental inquiries  changes in governmental regulation and policy  patents or proprietary rights  changes in consumer preferences and demand  new financings  and general market conditions may have a significant impact on our share price 
higher volatility increases the chance of larger than normal price swings which reduces predictability in the share value of our stock and could impair investment decisions 
in addition  price and volume trading volatility in the us stock markets can have a substantial effect on our share price  frequently for reasons other than our operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
fluctuations in exchange rates  interest rates and certain commodities could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our canadian corporate office and our canadian subsidiaries are translated into us dollars on consolidation and to interest rate risk as a large percentage of our term debt is at variable rates 
see item a for a quantitative and qualitative disclose about these risks 
debt financing the credit facility that the company has with a syndicate of banks contains restrictive covenants that limit the discretion of the company s management with respect to certain business matters 
these covenants place restrictions on  among other things  the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  to create other security interests  to complete a liquidation  dissolution  merger  amalgamation or reorganization  to make certain distributions or make certain payments  investments  loans and guarantees and to sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets 
the credit facility also includes covenants requiring the company to satisfy certain financial ratios and tests 
a failure of the company to comply with these obligations could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could permit the acceleration of the relevant indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that  if any indebtedness under the credit facility were to be accelerated  the company s assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 
furthermore  prior to the expiry of the credit facility  the company may be required to refinance its short term debt 
if the company is required to replace the credit facility with new debt on less favourable terms  or if the company cannot refinance its short term debt  the company may be adversely impacted 
we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and integrate acquired companies our growth strategy inherently assumes that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates on terms acceptable to us and that these acquisitions  if pursued and completed  will be integrated successfully 
our ability to effectively integrate current and future acquisitions  including our ability to realize potentially available marketing opportunities and cost savings in a timely and efficient manner will have a direct impact on our future results 
we may encounter problems in connection with the integration of any new businesses  such as integration of an acquired brand or business distribution channels with those of sunopta  integration of an acquired company s products into our product mix  amount of cost savings that may be realized as the result of our integration of an acquired brand or business  unanticipated quality and production issues with acquired products  adverse effects on business relationships with our suppliers and customers  diversion of management attention  difficulty with personnel and loss of key employees  implementation of an integrated enterprise wide accounting and information system  compatibility of financial control and information systems  exchange rate risk with respect to our acquisitions in canada 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and limit risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as cash and cash equivalents or short term investments and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported through profit and loss 
as at december  all of sunopta s excess funds were held in cash and cash equivalents with a maturity less than days 
debt in both fixed rate and floating rate interest carry different types of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt may have their fair market value adversely affected by a decline in interest rates 
in general  longer date debts are subject to greater interest rate risk than shorter dated securities 
floating rate term debt gives less predictability to cash flows as interest rates change 
as at december   the weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate term debt was and   of the company s outstanding term debt is at fixed interest rates 
variable rate term debt of   at an interest rate of is partially hedged by variable rate cash equivalent investments 
the company looks at varying factors to determine the percentage of debt to hold at fixed rates including  the interest rate spread between variable and fixed swap rates  the company s view on interest rate trends  the percent of offset to variable rate debt through holding variable rate investments and the companies ability to manage with interest rate volatility and uncertainty 
for every increase decrease in interest rates the company s after tax earnings would decrease increase by approximately  
given the short duration of fixed rate debt changes in interest rates would have a negligible affect on fixed rate debt valuations 
foreign currency risk all us subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency and the united states dollar is also the company s reporting currency 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the company and its canadian subsidiaries are translated into us dollars on consolidation 
since  the canadian dollar has appreciated significantly against the us dollar with closing rates moving from cdn at january  to cdn at december  for each us dollar 
the net effect of this appreciation has been a   exchange gain and a   increase in net assets 
a movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates in favour of against the canadian dollar with all other variables held constant would result in an increase decrease in the fair value of the company s net assets by  
the functional currency of all operations located in canada is the canadian dollar 
for these operations all transaction gains or losses in relation to the us dollar are recorded as foreign exchange gain loss in the consolidated statement of earnings while gains losses on translation of net assets to us dollars on consolidation are recorded in the currency translation adjustment account within shareholders equity 
the functional currency of the corporate head office is the us dollar 
transaction gains or losses as well as translation gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities are recorded within foreign exchange gains losses on the consolidated statement of earnings 
us based food group operations have limited exposure to other currencies since almost all sales and purchases are made in us dollars 
it is the company s intention to hold excess funds in the currency in which the funds are likely to be used  which will from time to time  potentially expose the company to exchange rate fluctuations when converted into us dollars 
commodity risk the food group enters into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on grain transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk from market price fluctuations 
futures contracts used for hedging purposes are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges 
inventories  however  may not be completely hedged  due in part to the company s assessment of its exposure from expected price fluctuations 
exchange purchase and sales contracts may expose the company to risk in the event that a counter party to a transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation 
the company manages its risk by entering into purchase contracts with pre approved producers 
the company has a risk of loss from hedge activity if a grower does not deliver the grain as scheduled 
sales contracts are entered into with organizations of acceptable creditworthiness  as internally evaluated 
all futures transactions are marked to market 
gains and losses on futures transactions related to grain inventories are included in cost of goods sold 
at december  the company owned   bushels of corn with a weighted average price of and   bushels of soy beans with a weighted average price of 
the company has at december  net long positions on corn and soy beans of   and   bushels respectively 
an increase decrease in commodity prices of would result in a gain loss of  in corn and   in soy beans  respectively 
there are no futures contracts in the other food group segments  opta minerals  the staketech steam explosion group or related to corporate office activities
