the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain of the financial statement line items for the year ended december  discussed in our comparison of the results of operations for the year ended december  to the year ended december  presented below reflect the reclassification of certain operating expenses from sales and marketing and research and development to cost of goods sold as presented in our amended form q s for the quarters ended march   june  and september  overview we are a provider of storage systems for organizations requiring high reliability  high performance networked storage and data management solutions in an open systems architecture 
our storage solutions consist of integrated hardware and software products employing a modular system that allows end users to add capacity as needed 
our broad range of products  from medium capacity stand alone storage units to complete turn key  multi terabyte storage area networks  provides end users with a cost effective means of addressing increasing storage demands without sacrificing performance 
our products and services are sold worldwide to end users primarily through our channel partners  including original equipment manufacturers  or oems  systems integrators  or sis  and value added resellers  or vars 
in may  we entered into a three year oem agreement with sun to provide our storage hardware and software products for private label sales by sun 
we have been shipping our products to sun for resale to sun s customers since october we have continued to develop new products primarily for resale by sun  such as our sannet ii fc  which began shipping to sun in march and our sannet ii sata product which began shipping in june we are discussing with sun the extent and timing of additional new product shipments 
in january  our existing three year oem partner agreement with sun  first announced in may  was extended 
the agreement will now continue through may   a two year extension to the original agreement subject to the terms of the agreement including early termination provisions 
we intend to continue expanding our non oem sales channels through sis and vars in order to decrease our revenue concentration with oems 
as part of our focus on indirect sales channels  we have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to solectron  a leading electronics manufacturing services company 
our agreement with solectron allows us to reduce sales cycle times and manufacturing infrastructure  enhance working capital and improve margins by taking advantage of solectron s manufacturing and procurement economies of scale 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of our sannet ii family of products 
in prior periods  we derived a significant portion of our revenue from sales of our legacy products and sannet i family of products 
except for one oem customer to whom we continue to sell our sannet i products  we have transitioned all customers to our sannet ii products 
we derive a portion of our revenue from services associated with the maintenance service we provide for our installed products 
in may  we entered into a services agreement with anacomp  inc to provide all maintenance  warranty and non warranty services for our sannet i and certain legacy products 
cost of goods sold includes costs of materials  subcontractor costs  salary and related benefits for the production and service departments  depreciation and amortization of equipment used in the production and service departments  production facility rent and allocation of overhead 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions  advertising and promotional costs and travel expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of project related expenses and salaries for employees directly engaged in research and development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation to officers and employees performing administrative functions and expenditures for administrative facilities 
restructuring expenses consist primarily of employee severance  lease termination costs and other office closure expenses related to the consolidation of excess facilities 
other income is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
our interest expense primarily relates to a million note payable that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of chaparral 
during august  we made a payment of approximately million representing both principle and interest to the holder of the million promissory note assumed in connection with our acquisition of chaparral in february there are no further amounts due 
in august  box hill systems corp 
merged with artecon  inc and we changed our name to dot hill systems corp 
we reincorporated in delaware in our headquarters is located in carlsbad  california  and we maintain international offices in germany  japan  the netherlands  singapore and the united kingdom 
on february   we completed the acquisition of chaparral network storage  inc  a privately held developer of specialized storage appliances as well as high performance  mid range raid controllers and data routers 
the total transaction cost of approximately million consisted of a payment of approximately million in cash  the assumption of approximately million related to obligations due certain employee covered by change in control agreements  approximately million of direct transaction costs and approximately million of accrued integration costs 
the acquisition of chaparral is expected to enable us increase the amount of proprietary technology within our storage systems  broaden our product line and diversify our customer base 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and use judgment that may impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as a part of our on going internal processes  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory write downs  warranty cost accruals  revenue recognition  bad debt allowances  long lived assets valuation  goodwill and intangible assets valuation  income taxes  including deferred income tax asset valuation  litigation and contingencies 
we base these estimates upon both historical information and other assumptions that we believe are valid and reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions form the basis for making judgments and determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for non software product sales upon transfer of title to the customer 
reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns are also recorded at that time 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  changes in customer demand and other factors 
if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience  additional allowances may be required 
certain of our sales arrangements include multiple elements 
generally  these arrangements include delivery of the product  installation  training and product maintenance 
maintenance related to product sales entitles the customer to basic product support and significantly greater response time in resolving warranty related issues 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based on its relative fair value 
for maintenance contracts this is typically the price charged when such contracts are sold separately or renewed 
because professional services related to installation and training can be provided by other third party organizations  we allocate revenue related to professional services based on rates that are consistent with other like companies providing similar services  ie  the market rate for such services 
revenue from product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally twelve months 
revenue from installation  training and consulting is recognized as the services are performed 
for software sales  we apply statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  whereby revenue is recognized from software licenses at the time the product is delivered  provided there are no significant obligations related to the sale  the resulting receivable is deemed collectible and there is vendor specific objective evidence supporting the value of the separate contract elements 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items 
a portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements  typically software maintenance contracts  is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally twelve months 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
a typical arrangement includes a software licensing fee and maintenance agreement 
valuation of inventories inventories are comprised of purchased parts and assemblies  which include direct labor and overhead 
we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value  with cost generally determined on a first in  first out basis 
we perform periodic valuation assessments based on projected sales forecasts and analyzing upcoming changes in future configurations of our products and record inventory write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts  we periodically are faced with uncertainties 
the outcomes of these uncertainties are not within our control  and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and commitments  and consequently  on our operating results 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those forecasted  additional inventory write downs might be required  adversely affecting operating results 
valuation of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we maintain a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset due to uncertainty regarding the future realization based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we operate at a loss or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  we could be required to proportionally increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which would result in a substantial increase to our effective tax rate and could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results 
conversely  if we continue to generate profits and ultimately determine that it is more likely than not that all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be utilized to offset future taxable income  the valuation allowance of a portion thereof could be eliminated 
at december   our net deferred tax asset is approximately million including approximately million net deferred tax asset acquired in the chaparral transaction  and we have provided for a valuation allowance against the entire net deferred tax asset 
an elimination of the valuation allowance as of december  would have resulted in a decrease to goodwill to the extent of our acquired net deferred tax asset  an increase to equity for net operating losses arising from stock option deductions  with the remaining deferred tax asset decreasing income tax expense  resulting in a one time  non cash increase in earnings 
we are continually assessing the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 
we will continue weighing various factors throughout the year to assess the need for any valuation allowance 
recoverability of the deferred tax assets is dependent on continued profitability from operations 
should our level of profitability continue as expected  we would likely remove the entire valuation allowance in although we would experience a substantial temporary decrease to our effective tax rate in the period in which we remove the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate in subsequent periods is likely to more closely resemble the applicable federal and state statutory tax rates 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated year ended december net revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative in process research and development restructuring expenses operating income loss net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to increased orders for our product from our channel partner  sun  which accounted for or million of our net revenue for the year ended december  total fibre channel units shipped were  for the year ended december  compared to  fibre channel units shipped for the year ended december   scsi units were shipped during the year ended december  compared to  scsi units for the year ended december  in march  we announced that our existing oem partner agreement with sun was expanded to include new advanced technology storage products to be designed and engineered by us to sun s specifications 
our sata product began shipping in the second quarter of while our blade product began shipping in the first quarter of we recorded revenue of approximately million related to such products during the year ended december  non sun revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  cost of goods sold decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the dollar amount of cost of goods sold was attributable to greater volume of product sales during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  including the incremental cost of goods sold attributable to the introduction of our sata and blade products 
additionally  cost of goods sold increased approximately million due to the impact of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of chaparral 
the decrease in cost of goods sold  as a percentage of our net revenue was primarily attributable to cost reductions related to production materials achieved during the year ended december  such cost reductions resulted mainly from the decreasing price of component parts due to competitive market factors  predetermined contractual cost reductions and the transition from soft to hard tooling as compared to the year ended december  gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  gross profit increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the dollar amount of gross profit was attributable to greater volume of product sales during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of our net revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily reflect cost reductions achieved during such cost reductions resulted mainly from the decreasing price of component parts due to competitive market factors  predetermined contractual cost reductions and the transition from soft to hard tooling 
these cost reductions were partially offset by the introduction in june of our sata and blade products that presently have significantly lower gross profit margins than either our fibre channel or scsi products 
gross profit for the year ended december  was also negatively impacted by million of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of chaparral in february we are currently transitioning the high labor content of our sata product to locales in asia and are working to complete the hard tooling of the chassis 
we expect to receive the benefits of these cost reduction efforts by the end of the second quarter of we believe our future gross profit margin will also be positively impacted by the integration of the technology we acquired from chaparral 
we anticipate our gross profit margin will begin to reflect such improvement in the second half of sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the dollar amount of sales and marketing related expenses is primarily attributable to increased salaries and related expenses of approximately million  an increase in travel and lodging expense of million  million related to small equipment and fixtures and million related to tradeshows 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses also reflects million from the amortization of the customer relationship intangible asset acquired in connection with the acquisition of chaparral 
these increases were partially off set by a decrease in professional services of approximately million compared to the prior year 
there are other increases in sales and marketing expenses relating to a variety of activities none of which are significant on an individual basis 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue primarily reflects the impact of increased revenue 
we will continue our efforts to grow our non oem commercial sales during accordingly  we expect sales and marketing expenses for the year ending december  will exceed spending levels incurred during research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the dollar increase in research and development expenses primarily reflects an increase in salary and related expenses of approximately million attributable to an increase in the number of our full time direct engineering team members compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   we averaged approximately full time direct engineering employees compared to an average of approximately full time direct engineering employees for the year ended december  the increase includes the addition of approximately engineering employees to our corporate headquarters in carlsbad  california resulting in an increase in salary and related expenses of approximately million compared to the year ended december  the establishment of our longmont technology center in connection with the acquisition of chaparral resulted in the addition of approximately new direct engineering employees 
salary and related expenses for such employees was million for the year ended december  there were no comparable expenses for the year ended december  the remaining increase in research and development expenses not directly related to headcount primarily reflect additional costs of million attributable to our longmont facility and its related activities for which there is no comparable expense for the year ended december  project related expenses at our carlsbad location exceeded the prior year by approximately million primarily related to our new sata and blade products and the integration of the technology acquired from chaparral into new and existing products 
the percentage increase in research and development expenses reflects all of the items discussed above  partially offset by the increase in revenue for the year ended december  and the reclassification of costs discussed above 
we expect that research and development expense will exceed amounts incurred during due to our planned efforts to complete the integration of the technology acquired from chaparral into our existing products and research and development activities related to other future product offerings 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the dollar amount of general and administrative expense during the year ended december  reflects an increase of million of legal and professional services expenses compared to the year ended december  the increase in legal expenses primarily reflects the legal matters described elsewhere in this document while the increase in professional services reflect the cost of our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of we also incurred an increase of million in bad debt expense compared to the year ended december  the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses relates to an increase in a variety of general and administrative expenses none of which are significant on an individual basis 
the percentage increase in general and administrative expenses reflect all of the items discussed above  partially offset by the increase in revenue for the year ended december  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in compared to due to the continuing cost of complying with various corporate governance regulations and the cost of corrective actions we intend to take as a result of such regulations 
restructuring expenses in june  we negotiated an exit from our lease of the th floor of our former new york city office thereby eliminating our related rent exposure 
accordingly  during the year ended december   we recorded a reduction of approximately million to our restructuring reserve previously established in connection with the closure of our new york city office 
additionally  we have evaluated certain factors pertaining to our remaining sublease tenant  accordingly  during the year ended december   we recorded an additional restructuring accrual of approximately million 
we are not aware of any further unresolved issues or additional liabilities that may result in a significant adjustment to restructuring expenses accrued as of december  in process research and development charges projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and for which no future alternative uses exist 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
for the year ended december  we recorded an ipr d charge of million  in connection with the acquisition of chaparral 
other income other income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in interest income 
although we had significantly more cash at december  compared to december   the proceeds from our secondary offering of our common stock were received in late september such proceeds therefore did not earn significant interest income during the year ended december  the increase in interest income was partially off set by approximately million in interest expense primarily related to the a million note payable assumed in connection with our acquisition of chaparral in february the note payable and all related accrued interest was paid off in august there are no amounts outstanding related to million note payable at december  income taxes our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  and of and is primarily attributable to federal and state minimum tax liabilities as well as local and foreign taxes 
our effective income tax rate for both the year ended december  and was significantly reduced through the use of net operating loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had previously been recorded 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million has been provided based upon our assessment of the future realizability of our deferred income tax assets  as it is currently considered more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will not be generated to realize these temporary differences 
additionally  at december   approximately million of the valuation allowance is attributable to the potential tax benefit of stock option transactions that will be credited directly to common stock  if realized 
as of december   we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  which begin to expire in and  respectively 
in addition  we have federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  of which million can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income  and the remaining million will begin to expire in the tax year we also have state tax credit carryforwards of million  of which million can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income  and the remaining million will begin to expire in as a result of the company s equity transactions  an ownership change  within the meaning of internal revenue code section  occurred on september  as a result  annual use of the company s federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards is limited to i the aggregate fair market value of artecon immediately before the ownership change multiplied by ii the long term tax exempt rate within the meaning of section f of the internal revenue code in effect at that time 
the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
we have not provided for any residual us income taxes on the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested 
such residual us income taxes  if any  would be insignificant

the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
we have not provided for any residual us income taxes on the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested 
such residual us income taxes  if any  would be insignificant 
net income loss net income increased million to net income of million for the year ended december  from a net loss of million for the year ended december  this increase of million was due to an increase in gross profit of million  a decrease in operating expenses of million  an increase in other income of million offset by a decrease in income tax benefit of million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital of million 
during february  we consummated the acquisition of chaparral for a cash purchase price of approximately million plus approximately million in other liabilities 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the net cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to net income of million increased by the add back of a non cash charge of million related to the write off of in process research and development in connection with our acquisition of chaparral and depreciation and amortization of million 
cash flow from operations reflects the positive impact of approximately million related to the management of certain payments to vendors 
cash provided from operations was negatively impacted by the increase in accounts receivable of approximately million 
this increase reflects the payment terms for our largest oem channel partner increasing from net days to net days during the first three months of fiscal year and then to net days for the three months ended june  and finally to days for the remaining six months of we are currently in negotiations with our third party manufacturer to increase our payment terms to them and therefore do not anticipate significant changes in our future cash flow as a result of the change in our payment terms with our largest oem channel partner 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the same period in the use of cash during is primarily attributable to the acquisition of chaparral that reduced cash by million net of cash acquired from chaparral 
we also made capital expenditures of million during the year ended december  primarily to support new product development and in preparation for the manufacture of our fiber channel product line in budapest  hungary 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately to million in additionally  we also made purchases of million in short term investments offset by proceeds of million received from the sales of short term investments during the year ended december  cash used by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we made payments on bank and other borrowings of approximately million 
included in this amount is approximately million representing both principle and interest to the holder of the million promissory note assumed in connection with our acquisition of chaparral in february there are no further amounts due related to the promissory note 
such payments were offset by proceeds received from bank and other borrowings of million and approximately million received from exercises of stock options under our stock incentive plan 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  reflects the completion of a secondary offering of our common stock 
effective july   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association  or wells fargo  which allows us to borrow up to million under a revolving line of credit that expires july  amounts loaned under the credit agreement bear interest at our option at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the prime rate in effect from time to time  or at a fixed rate per annum determined by wells fargo to be above libor in effect on the first day of the applicable fixed rate term 
in connection with the credit agreement  to the extent we have outstanding borrowings  we have granted wells fargo a security interest in our investment management account maintained with wells capital management incorporated

we presently expect cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations to be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months and to enable us to pursue acquisitions or significant capital improvements 
the actual amount and timing of working capital and capital expenditures that we may incur in future periods may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous factors  including the amount and timing of the receipt of revenues from continued operations  our ability to manage our relationships with third party manufacturers  the status of our relationships with key customers  partners and suppliers  the timing and extent of the introduction of new products and services and growth in personnel and operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
our primary investment strategy is to preserve the principal amounts invested  maximize investment yields  and maintain liquidity to meet projected cash requirements 
accordingly  we invest in instruments such as money market funds  certificates of deposit  us government agencies bonds  notes  bills and municipal bonds that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
our investment policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  and type of instrument 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and we do not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not expect to incur any material losses with respect to our investment portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio at december  and for investment securities  the table presents carrying values at december  and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
december  amounts in thousands cash equivalents   average interest rate 
short term investments   average interest rate total portfolio average interest rate we have a line of credit agreement  which accrues interest at a variable rate 
as of december   we had no balance under this line 
were we to incur a balance under this line  we would be exposed to interest rate risk on such debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a portion of our international business is presently conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the us dollar will cause currency transaction gains and losses  which we have experienced in the past and continue to experience 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience currency losses in the future 
we have not undertaken hedging transactions to cover currency exposure and we do not intend to engage in hedging activities in the future
