recent developments on october   chiron corporation announced that it would not supply fluvirin influenza vaccine to the us market for the current influenza season as a result of action by the uk regulatory body  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra  to temporarily suspend its license to manufacture fluvirin influenza vaccine in chiron s liverpool  uk facility 
on october   based on the uk food and drug administration s fda evaluation and inspection of chiron s liverpool  uk manufacturing facility  the fda announced that none of the influenza vaccine manufactured by chiron for the us market was safe for use 
we are the primary distributor of fluvirin to the us market and chiron is currently our primary supplier of the influenza vaccine 
on december   we entered into a multi year agreement terminating in with id biomedical corporation to distribute id biomedical s fluviral influenza vaccine 
the agreement will commence upon approval of fluviral by the fda  which could be as early as if the fda provides expedited approval of the id biomedical application  and will terminate in once fluviral is approved by the fda  id biomedical plans to manufacture up to an estimated million doses for the us market in  and increase production to approximately million doses by similarly  we will increase the number of fluviral doses we purchase over that time  and by will have approximately million doses per year available for distribution to our customers 
on march   chiron announced that it received notice from the mhra that the agency has lifted the license suspension for chiron s liverpool  uk manufacturing facility 
the decision is conditioned on the understanding that chiron s level of commitment to the completion of its remediation plan and ongoing improvements must continue 
chiron is required to provide the mhra with regular weekly updates to ensure that progress on its various projects proceeds satisfactorily and the mhra may conduct further inspections 
on march   the fda announced that it has been working closely with the mhra  including during inspections  as the agency evaluates chiron s progress in correcting their manufacturing problems 
the fda plans to conduct a comprehensive inspection of chiron s liverpool  uk manufacturing facility to ensure that chiron can produce a safe and effective vaccine once all critical stages of manufacturing are fully operational and needed corrective actions can be fully evaluated 
given the significant uncertainty about whether fluvirin will be available for the influenza season  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax one time charge of approximately million related to our fluvirin contract 
this charge represented the write off of a deferred expense associated with the influenza season 
executive level overview we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to office based healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets 
we serve more than  customers worldwide  including dental practices and laboratories  physician practices and veterinary clinics  
table of contents as well as government and other institutions 
we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than years of experience distributing healthcare products 
we are headquartered in melville  new york  employ nearly  people and have operations in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  the netherlands  belgium  germany  france  austria  portugal  spain  the czech republic  luxembourg  italy  ireland  switzerland  australia and new zealand 
we also have affiliates in iceland and israel 
we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency 
this infrastructure  together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices  and a strong commitment to customer service  enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers needs 
our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid  accurate and complete order fulfillment 
we conduct our business through two segments healthcare distribution and technology 
these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base 
the healthcare distribution segment consists of our dental  medical including veterinary and international groups 
products distributed consist of consumable products  small equipment  laboratory products  large dental equipment  branded and generic pharmaceuticals  vaccines  surgical products  diagnostic tests  infection control products and vitamins 
our dental group serves office based dental practices in the combined united states and canadian dental market 
our medical group serves office based physician practices  as well as surgical centers and other alternate care settings and veterinarian clinics throughout the united states 
our international group serves practices in countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading pan european healthcare supplier serving office based dental  medical and veterinary practices 
our technology group provides software  technology and other value added services to healthcare providers  primarily in the united states and canada 
our value added practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practices and veterinary clinics 
our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing education services for practitioners 
industry overview in recent years  the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment 
this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices 
this trend has also accelerated the growth of hmos  group practices  other managed care accounts and collective buying groups  which  in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at low prices  tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support 
we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably impact demand for practice management systems and software that can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 
our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions we undertook to expand our business  both domestically and internationally  in part  to address significant changes in the healthcare industry  including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies  potential healthcare reform  trends toward managed care  cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 
industry consolidation the healthcare products distribution industry  as it relates to office based healthcare practitioners  is highly fragmented and diverse 
this industry  which encompasses the dental  medical  and veterinary markets  was estimated to produce revenues of approximately billion in in the combined north american and european markets 
the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations comprising anywhere from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 

table of contents due in part to the inability of office based healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices  the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to office based healthcare practitioners has traditionally been characterized by frequent  small quantity orders  and a need for rapid  reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment 
the purchasing decision within an office based healthcare practice is typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant  and supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor  with one generally serving as the primary supplier 
we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors  particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources  seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide opportunities for growth 
this consolidation may also continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 
our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry 
this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas  which complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with  and thus strengthen  the acquired businesses 
on june   we acquired all of the outstanding equity shares of the demedis group  excluding its austrian operations 
this acquisition approximately doubled the net sales of our international operations 
additionally  since the beginning of  we have completed more than acquisitions 
as industry consolidation continues  we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend  as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure 
in the us dental market  we estimate that there are currently more than smaller distributors holding approximately of the market 
in the us medical market  we estimate that more than smaller distributors hold approximately of the market  and in the european dental market  we estimate that more than competitors hold approximately of the market 
as the healthcare industry continues to change  we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction  if pursued 
if additional transactions are entered into or consummated  we would incur additional merger and acquisition related costs  and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 
aging population and other market influences the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population  increased healthcare awareness  the proliferation of medical technology and testing  new pharmacology treatments and expanded third party insurance coverage 
in addition  the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing in hospitals to the alternate care site  particularly physicians offices 
as the cosmetic surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow  physicians are increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices 
the elder care market continues to benefit from the increasing growth rate of the population of elderly americans 
the january us bureau of the census estimates that the elderly population in america will more than double by the year in  four million americans were age years and older  the segment of the population most in need of long term care and elder care services 
by the year  that number is 
table of contents projected to more than triple to over million 
the population segment age to years is projected to more than double in the same time period 
as a result of these market dynamics  the annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the united states 
the centers for medicaid and medicare services cms  office of the actuary published health spending projections through in  indicating that total national healthcare spending reached trillion in  or of the nation s gross domestic product 
healthcare spending is projected to reach trillion in  an estimated of the gross domestic product  the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states 
governmental influences the healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation  licensure and operating compliance procedures 
national healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative initiatives by congress 
additionally  government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care 
the balanced budget act passed by congress in significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers  affecting spending levels and overall financial viability of these institutions 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act the medicare act is the largest expansion of the medicare program since its inception and provides participants with voluntary prescription drug benefits effective in with an interim drug discount card 
the medicare act also includes provisions relating to medication management programs  generic substitution and provider reimbursement 
based upon current information  we believe the medicare act may create additional volume demand and provide incentives for additional utilization of generic drugs  both of which have potentially positive implications for the pharmaceutical distribution portion of our business 
product integrity certain pharmaceutical and medical surgical product manufacturers are in discussions with legislators about the risks of counterfeit products in the supply chain and manufacturers concerns regarding the impact of secondary market distribution on counterfeiting 
as a distributor of such products  we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation

gross profit gross profit and gross margins for and by segment and in total were as follows in thousands gross gross margin margin healthcare distribution technology total gross profit increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry  our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies 
additionally  we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution segment 
these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products combined with the nature of the software industry  in which developers realize higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include the funding of acquisitions and repayments of debt assumed in acquisitions  repurchases of common stock  working capital needs and capital expenditures 
working capital requirements generally result from increased sales  special inventory forward buy in opportunities and payment terms for receivables and payables 
because sales tend to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buy in opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the year  our working capital requirements have generally been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 
we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations  revolving credit facilities  private placement loans and stock issuances 
our principal sources of cash are from our operations and short term and long term debt financings 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for  and supply by our vendors of  our products and services 
given current operating  economic and industry conditions  we believe that demand for our products and services will be consistent in the foreseeable future 
net cash flow provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year period 
this net change of million was due primarily to changes in the timing of cash receipts from customers and cash payments to vendors accounting for an increase of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year period 
the net change of million was primarily due to payments for completed and pending business acquisitions  which accounted for million

we expect to invest approximately million during fiscal year in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and computer systems infrastructure and to integrate certain operations 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year period 
the net change of million was primarily due to our issuance of long term debt accounting for an increase of million  net of issuance costs  partially offset by repayments of the debt assumed in business acquisitions accounting for a decrease of million and increased payments to repurchase our common stock accounting for a decrease of million

table of contents our business requires a substantial investment in working capital  which is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands 
inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity  special inventory forward buy in opportunities and our desired level of inventory 
our accounts receivable days sales outstanding improved to days as of december  from days as of december  our inventory turns remained constant at turns for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
we anticipate future increases in our working capital requirements as a result of continued sales growth

given the uncertainties surrounding the pending fda approval for both companies to distribute influenza vaccine in the us for the influenza season  we have excluded these purchase obligations from the above table 
our purchase commitment under our agreement with chiron corporation would require us to pay million in if they are able to meet their obligations under the agreement 
our purchase commitment under our agreement with id biomedical which terminates in would require us to pay an amount per dose based each year on the market price then prevailing 
under current market prices  this commitment would aggregate to approximately million for  increasing to approximately million in and each year thereafter 
on august   we completed an issuance of million of convertible debt 
these notes are senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of and are due to mature on august  interest on the notes is payable on february and august of each year  which commenced on february  the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion ratio of shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes  which is the equivalent conversion price of per share 
upon conversion  we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of the notes to be converted  in cash  with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of our common stock 
we currently have sufficient availability of funds through our million revolving credit facility along with cash on hand to fully satisfy the cash portion of our conversion obligation 
in prior years  we completed private placement transactions under which we issued million and million in senior notes 
the million notes come due on june  and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
principal payments totaling million are due annually starting september  on the million notes and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
interest on both notes is payable semi annually 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into agreements relating to the million senior notes to exchange our fixed interest rates for variable interest rates 
for the year ended december   the weighted average variable interest rate was 
this weighted average variable interest rate comprises libor  plus a spread and resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes 

table of contents we have a revolving credit facility of million that is a four year committed line scheduled to expire in may we financed our acquisition of the demedis group with cash on hand  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and with proceeds from a bridge loan in the amount of million 
these borrowings were repaid in full as of december  with the net proceeds from our million convertible debt issuance on august  as of december   there were million of letters of credit provided to third parties and no borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had available various short term bank credit lines of which million was outstanding 
such credit lines bear interest at rates ranging from to  and were collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory and property and equipment with an aggregate net carrying value of million at december  on june   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a second common stock repurchase program 
the new program allows us to repurchase up to million in shares of our common stock  which represented approximately of shares outstanding on the announcement date 
as of december   we had repurchased million or  shares under this initiative 
some holders of minority interests in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their interest at a price that approximates fair value pursuant to a formula price as defined in the agreements 
additionally  some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain profitability targets are met 
we have not accrued any liabilities that may arise from these transactions because the outcome of the contingency is not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 
we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least months 
funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs which  on occasion  may change 
consequently  we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  ability to access public and private debt markets and public equity markets  and available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short term and long term capital needs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical data  when available  experience  industry and market trends  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
however  by their nature  estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties 
reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions  judgments and estimates  including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  which have been discussed with our audit committee  affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of dental  medical and veterinary consumable products  as well as dental equipment  software products and services and other sources 
provisions for discounts  rebates to customers  customer returns and other contra revenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 
revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers 
such sales typically entail high volume  low dollar orders shipped using third party common carriers 
we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of 
table of contents the earnings process because we have no post shipment obligations  the product price is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 
revenue derived from the sale of dental equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers 
such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians 
some equipment sales require minimal installation  which is completed at the time of delivery 
revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers 
such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design 
revenue derived from post contract customer support for software  including annual support and or training  is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 
revenue derived from other sources including freight charges  equipment repairs and financial services  is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 
accounts receivable and reserves the carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected 
in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable  we consider many factors in estimating our reserve  including historical data  experience  customer types  credit worthiness and economic trends 
from time to time  we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectibility 
although making changes to our judgments  estimates and or assumptions would affect our financial results  we believe the effect would not likely be material 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
such impairment tests require the comparison of the fair value and carrying value of reporting units 
measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings  unless supportable information is available for using a present value technique  such as estimates of future cash flows 
although making changes to our judgments  estimates and or assumptions would affect our financial results  we believe the effect would not likely be material 
we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important  which could trigger an interim impairment review  include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets have been impaired  we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income 
based on our impairment review process  we have not recorded any material impairments during  or long lived assets long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from assets 
definite lived intangible assets primarily 
table of contents consist of non compete agreements  trademarks  trade names and customer relationships 
when an impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
we have not recorded any material impairments during  or stock based compensation we account for stock option awards to employees under the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  no compensation expense is recorded provided the exercise price is equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date 
we make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of accounting the alternative method of accounting for stock based compensation had been applied as required by fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value based method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk free interest rates  stock price volatility  dividend yield and weighted average option life 
if different assumptions were applied  the results would be different  however  such results would not affect our financial statements as this is a disclosure only requirement 
beginning in the third quarter of  in connection with our adoption of fas r discussed below stock based compensation will be included in our results of operations 
the method and assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock based compensation under fas r will be similar to those used under fas if different assumptions were applied  the results would be different  however  we believe such results would not have a material effect on our results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued fas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement changes the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this statement does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in fas as originally issued and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
this statement is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after june  and applies to all outstanding and unvested stock based payment awards at the date of adoption 
we anticipate the adoption of fas r will affect our results of operations to an extent similar to that as presented in our fas pro forma disclosure included in the accompanying audited financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
this statement requires that such items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the provisions of fas must be applied prospectively 
we do not anticipate the adoption of fas to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
fasb staff position fsp no 
accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp  provides guidance under fas no 
 accounting for income taxes  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on enterprises income tax 
table of contents expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act was enacted on october  fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fas no 
we have not yet completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions 
accordingly  as provided for in fsp  we have not adjusted our tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates  as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
we attempt to minimize these risks by using interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward and swap contracts 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange risks 
factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments 
all interest rate swap and currency contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate and currency exposure  not for speculation 
interest rate swaps we have fixed rate senior notes of million at and million at 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange our fixed interest rates for variable interest rates payable on the million senior notes 
the variable rate is comprised of libor plus the spreads and resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes 
as a result of these interest rate swap agreements  as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements  we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
as of december   the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded in other non current liabilities was million  which represented the amount that would be paid upon unwinding the interest rate swap agreements based on market conditions at that time 
changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to non current assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the million notes as such hedges are deemed fully effective 
foreign exchange the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results 
fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  and retained earnings  all of which are expressed in us dollars 
where we deem it prudent  we engage in hedging programs  using primarily foreign currency forward and swap contracts  aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings 
we purchase short term foreign currency forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with long term intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign vendors 
we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars  as we regard this as an accounting not an economic exposure 

table of contents as of december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts aggregating million  of which million related to intercompany debt and million related to the purchase of merchandise from foreign vendors 
the contracts hedge against currency fluctuations of euros million  british pounds million  australian dollars million  swedish krona million  swiss francs million  japanese yen thousand and new zealand dollars thousand 
as of december   the gross amount of these contracts  calculated as the aggregate value of future us dollar payments and receipts  determined by quoted market prices  was million 
these contracts expire through june for the year ended december   we recognized a loss relating to our foreign currency forward and swap contracts of thousand 
risk factors the healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 
we compete with numerous companies  including several major manufacturers and distributors 
some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do  which could allow them to compete more successfully 
most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors 
competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products  which we would then be unable to market 
manufacturers could also increase their efforts to sell directly to end users and by pass distributors like us 
industry consolidation among healthcare products distributors  the unavailability of products  whether due to our inability to gain access to products or interruptions in supply from manufacturers  or the emergence of new competitors could also increase competition 
in the future  we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues 
the healthcare industry is experiencing changes which could adversely affect our business 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs  including the reduction of spending budgets by government and private insurance programs  such as medicare  medicaid and corporate health insurance plans  pressures relating to potential healthcare reform  trends toward managed care  consolidation of healthcare distribution companies  collective purchasing arrangements among office based healthcare practitioners  and reimbursements to customers 
if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  the enactment of any significant healthcare reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we must comply with government regulations governing the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and additional regulations could negatively affect our business 
our business is subject to requirements under various local  state  federal and international governmental laws and regulations applicable to the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices 
among the federal laws with which we must comply are the controlled substances act and the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  including the prescription drug marketing act of and the safe medical devices act 
such laws regulate the storage and distribution  labeling  handling  record keeping  manufacturing and advertising of drugs and medical devices  subject us to inspection by the federal food and drug administration and the drug enforcement administration  regulate the transportation of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials  
table of contents require registration with the federal food and drug administration and the drug enforcement administration  require us to coordinate returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall procedures  and impose reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical or medical device causes serious illness  injury or death 
our business is also subject to requirements of foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad 
the failure to comply with any of these regulations or the imposition of any additional regulations could negatively affect our business 
there can be no assurance that current or future us or foreign government regulations will not adversely affect our business 
our international operations are subject to inherent risks  which could adversely affect our operating results 
international operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the risks that our international operations are subject to include difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties in establishing channels of distribution  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions  repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the united states  cumbersome regulatory requirements  unexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products  imposition of import export duties  quotas  sanctions or penalties  and unexpected regulatory  economic and political changes in foreign markets 
as a result of our acquisition of the demedis group  our foreign operations are significantly larger and  therefore  our exposure to the risks inherent in international operations has become greater 
we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings 
as a result  we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations 
net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products including influenza vaccine  equipment and software products  purchasing patterns of office based healthcare practitioners and year end promotions 
net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter  primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters 
quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors  including 
table of contents costs of developing new applications and services  costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses  the timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures  general economic conditions  as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries  the timing of the release of functions of our technology related products and services  and our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships 
any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
if our operating results do not meet market expectations  our stock price may decline 
because we do not manufacture the products we distribute  we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of our products 
we obtain substantially all of our products from third party suppliers 
generally  we do not have long term contracts with our suppliers  committing them to supply products to us 
therefore  suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request 
because we do not control the actual production of the products we sell  we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control 
in the event that any of our third party suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in required volumes  we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis  if at all 
an extended interruption in the supply of our products  including the supply of our influenza vaccine and any other high sales volume product  would have an adverse effect on our results of operations  which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 
our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves several risks 
we have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures  and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future 
such transactions involve numerous risks  including possible adverse effects on our operating results or the market price of our common stock 
some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations  which payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures may result in a loss of customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures  requires significant management attention  and may place significant demands on our operations  information systems and financial resources 
there can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful 
our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices  our ability to consummate such transactions  which could potentially be prohibited due to national or international antitrust regulations  and the availability of financing on acceptable terms  in the case of non stock transactions 

table of contents we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury 
our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products 
additionally  we own a majority interest in a company that manufactures dental implants and we are subject to the potential risk of product liability or other claims relating to the manufacture of products by that entity 
one of the potential risks we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit products infiltrating the supply chain 
in addition  some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials 
the improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability 
we have insurance policies  including product liability insurance  covering risks and in amounts we consider adequate 
additionally  in many cases we are covered by indemnification from the manufacturer of the product 
however  we cannot assure you that the coverage maintained by us is sufficient to cover future claims  that it will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost  or that indemnification agreements will provide adequate protection for us 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or indemnification  or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us  could harm our business 
our technology segment depends upon continued product development  technical support and successful marketing 
competition among companies supplying practice management software is intense and increasing 
our future sales of practice management software will depend on  among other factors the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs  our ability to enhance our products  and our ability to provide ongoing technical support 
we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software or software enhancements  or that such software will be released on time or accepted by the market 
our software products  like software products generally  may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released 
we cannot be sure that future problems with post release software errors or bugs will not occur 
any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software 
we do not have any patents on our software  and rely upon copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as contractual and common law protections 
we cannot assure you that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software products 
our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as key customers  vendors and manufacturers of the products we distribute 
our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as key customers  vendors and manufacturers 
if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future  our business may suffer 
our future performance is materially dependent upon our senior management 
our future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management  particularly stanley m 
bergman  chairman  chief executive officer and president  among others 
the loss of the services of mr 
bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have an employment agreement with mr 
bergman 
we do not currently have key man life insurance 
table of contents policies on any of our employees 
competition for senior management is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel 
increases in the cost of shipping or service trouble with our third party shippers could harm our business 
shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business 
we ship almost all of our us orders by united parcel service  inc and other delivery services  and typically bear the cost of shipment 
accordingly  any significant increase in shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
similarly  strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 
we may not be able to respond to technological change effectively 
traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic on line commerce solutions 
our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition 
the advancement of on line commerce will require us to cost effectively adapt to changing technologies  to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address changing demands of consumers and our clients on a timely basis  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our business 
we are exposed to the risk of an increase in interest rates 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange our fixed rate interest rates for variable interest rates payable on our million senior notes 
our fixed interest rates on the senior notes were and for the million and million senior notes  respectively 
the variable rate is comprised of libor plus the spreads and resets on the interest due dates for the senior notes 
as a result of these interest rate swap agreements  as well as our existing variable rate credit lines  and loan agreements  we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
for example  a hypothetical basis points increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
our acquisition of the demedis group may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect 
on june   we acquired the demedis group 
we are in the process of integrating these companies and assimilating the operations  services  products and personnel of each company with our management policies  procedures and strategies 
we cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from this acquisition or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with this acquisition 
to effectively manage our expected future growth  we must continue to successfully manage our integration of the demedis group and continue to improve our operational systems  internal procedures  accounts receivable and management  financial and operational controls 
if we fail in any of these areas  our business could be adversely affected 
the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 
the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 
a variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community  changes in our industry and competitors  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and prospects  
table of contents any future issuances of our common stock  which may include primary offerings for cash  stock splits  issuances in connection with business acquisitions and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time  general market and economic conditions  and any outbreak or escalation of hostilities 
in addition  the nasdaq national market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq 
broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies 
this type of litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would harm our business 
certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage third party offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares 
the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  may discourage acquisition bids  and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions  among other things require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of the shares of common stock entitled to vote to approve a merger  consolidation  or a sale  lease  transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets  and require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of our common stock entitled to vote to remove a director  and to amend or repeal our by laws  with certain limited exceptions 
in addition  the henry schein  inc stock incentive plan  the henry schein  inc non employee director stock incentive plan and the henry schein  inc non employee director stock option plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control  and certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments if those executive officers are terminated without cause within two years after a change in control 
we also have a stockholder rights plan which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us if our board of directors does not determine that the acquisition proposal is adequate and in the stockholders best interest
